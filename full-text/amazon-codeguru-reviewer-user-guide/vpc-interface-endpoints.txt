CodeGuru Reviewer and interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)
You can use VPC endpoints when you call Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer APIs. When you use VPC endpoints, your API calls are more secure because they are contained within your VPC and do not access the internet. For more information, see Actions in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer API Reference. 
You establish a private connection between your VPC and CodeGuru Reviewer by creating an interface VPC endpoint. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access CodeGuru Reviewer APIs without an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC don't need public IP addresses to communicate with CodeGuru Reviewer APIs. Traffic between your VPC and CodeGuru Reviewer does not leave the Amazon network. 
Each interface endpoint is represented by one or more Elastic Network Interfaces in your subnets. 
For more information, see Interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) in the Amazon VPC User Guide. 
Note
CodeGuru Reviewer does not support Amazon VPC endpoint policies.
