Install or upgrade and then configure the AWS CLI
To call Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer commands from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) on a local development machine, you must install the AWS CLI. 
Note
You cannot create a repository association for a GitHub repository using the AWS CLI. You can use the AWS CLI to create a repository association for all other support supported repository types. For more information, see Working with repository associations in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer.
If you have an older version of the AWS CLI installed, we recommend you upgrade it so the CodeGuru Reviewer commands are available. To check the version, use the aws --version command.
To install and configure the AWS CLI


Follow the instructions in Installing the AWS Command Line Interface to install or upgrade the AWS CLI.


To configure the AWS CLI, see Configuring the AWS Command Line Interface and Managing Access Keys for IAM Users. 
Important
When you configure the AWS CLI, you are prompted to specify an AWS Region. Choose one of the supported Regions listed in Region and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.


To verify the installation or upgrade, call the following command from the AWS CLI.


aws codeguru-reviewer help
