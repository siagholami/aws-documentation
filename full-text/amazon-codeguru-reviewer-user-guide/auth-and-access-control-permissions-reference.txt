Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer permissions reference
You can use AWS-wide condition keys in your CodeGuru Reviewer policies to express conditions. For a list, see IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference in the IAM User Guide. 
You specify the actions in the policy's Action field. To specify an action, use the codeguru-reviewer: prefix followed by the API operation name (for example, codeguru-reviewer:AssociateRepository and codeguru-reviewer:DisassociateRepository). To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas (for example, "Action": [ "codeguru-reviewer:AssociateRepository", "codeguru-reviewer:DisassociateRepository" ]). 
Using wildcard characters 
You specify an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), with or without a wildcard character (*), as the resource value in the policy's Resource field. You can use a wildcard to specify multiple actions or resources. For example, codeguru-reviewer:* specifies all CodeGuru Reviewer actions and codeguru-reviewer:List* specifies all CodeGuru Reviewer actions that begin with the word List. The following example refers to all repository associations with a universally unique identifier (UUID) that begins with PullRequest-GITHUB. 
arn:aws:codeguru-reviewer:us-east-2:123456789012:association:PullRequest-GITHUB*
You can use the following table as a reference when you are setting up Authenticating with identities in CodeGuru Reviewer and writing permissions policies that you can attach to an IAM identity (identity-based policies).
