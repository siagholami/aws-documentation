Create a GitHub repository association in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer
You can create a GitHub repository association using the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer console. You cannot create a GitHub repository using the AWS CLI or the CodeGuru Reviewer SDK. Before you create a GitHub repository association, you must have a GitHub repository. 
To create a GitHub repository association


Open the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/reviewer/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Associated repositories. 


Choose Associate repository. 


Choose GitHub. 


If you are not connected to GitHub, choose Connect to GitHub and follow the prompts to connect. 


From Repository location, choose your repository, then choose Associate. On the Associated repositories page, the Status is Associating. When the association is complete, the status changes to Associated and you can create a pull request or a repository analysis to get recommendations. Refresh the page to check for the status change.
