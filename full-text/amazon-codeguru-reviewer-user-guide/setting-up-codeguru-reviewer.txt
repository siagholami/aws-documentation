Setting up with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer
Complete the tasks in this section to set up Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer for the first time. If you already have an AWS account, know the repository that contains the source code you want reviewed, and prefer to use the defaults for IAM, skip ahead to Getting started.
You should know the following about Amazon Web Services (AWS): 
 When you sign up for AWS, your AWS account automatically has access to all services in AWS, including CodeGuru Reviewer. However, you are charged only for the services that you use. 
 With CodeGuru Reviewer, you pay only for analysis of lines of code that change or are new in pull requests. For more information, see Amazon CodeGuru pricing.
