Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be verified in order to create an image pipeline with EC2 Image Builder.
EC2 Image Builder service-linked role
EC2 Image Builder uses a service-linked role to grant permissions to other AWS services on your behalf. You don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you create your first Image Builder resource in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API, Image Builder creates the service-linked role for you. For more information about the service-linked role that Image Builder creates in your account, see Using service-linked roles for EC2 Image Builder. 
Configuration requirements

Image Builder supports AWS PrivateLink.
Image Builder supports EC2-Classic. 
Instances used to build images and run tests using Image Builder must have access to the Systems Manager service. All build activity is orchestrated by SSM Automation. The SSM Agent will be installed on the source image if it is not already present, and it will be removed before the image is created.

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
The IAM role that you associate with your instance profile must have permissions to run the build and test components included in your image. The following IAM role policies must be attached to the IAM role that is associated with the instance profile: EC2InstanceProfileForImageBuilder and AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore.
If you configure logging, the instance profile specified in your infrastructure configuration must have s3:PutObject permissions for the target bucket (arn:aws:s3:::BucketName/*).
