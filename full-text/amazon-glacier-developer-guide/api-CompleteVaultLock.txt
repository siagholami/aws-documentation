Complete Vault Lock (POST lockId)
Description
This operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the vault lock from the InProgress state to the Locked state, which causes the vault lock policy to become unchangeable. A vault lock is put into the InProgress state by calling Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy). You can obtain the state of the vault lock by calling Get Vault Lock (GET lock-policy). For more information about the vault locking process, see Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock. 
This operation is idempotent. This request is always successful if the vault lock is in the Locked state and the provided lock ID matches the lock ID originally used to lock the vault.
If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the Locked state, the operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the InProgress state, the operation throws an InvalidParameter error.
Requests
To complete the vault locking process, send an HTTP POST request to the URI of the vault's lock-policy subresource with a valid lock ID.
Syntax
1. POST /AccountId/vaults/vaultName/lock-policy/lockId HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
3. Date: Date
4. Authorization: SignatureValue

Note
The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
The lockId value is the lock ID obtained from a Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy) request.
