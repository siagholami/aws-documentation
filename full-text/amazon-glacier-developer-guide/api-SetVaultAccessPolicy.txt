Set Vault Access Policy (PUT access-policy)
Description
This operation configures an access policy for a vault and will overwrite an existing policy. To configure a vault access policy, send a PUT request to the access-policy subresource of the vault. You can set one access policy per vault and the policy can be up to 20 KB in size. For more information about vault access policies, see Amazon S3 Glacier Access Control with Vault Access Policies.
