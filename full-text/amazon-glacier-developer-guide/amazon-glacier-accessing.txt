Accessing Amazon S3 Glacier
Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) is a RESTful web service that uses HTTP and HTTPS as a transport and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as a message serialization format. Your application code can make requests directly to the S3 Glacier web service API. When using the REST API directly, you must write the necessary code to sign and authenticate your requests. For more information about the API, see API Reference for Amazon S3 Glacier. 
Alternatively, you can simplify application development by using the AWS SDKs that wrap the S3 Glacier REST API calls. You provide your credentials, and these libraries take care of authentication and request signing. For more information about using the AWS SDKs, see Using the AWS SDKs with Amazon S3 Glacier.
S3 Glacier also provides a console. You can use the console to create and delete vaults. However, all the archive and job operations require you to write code and make requests using either the REST API directly or the AWS SDK wrapper libraries. To access the S3 Glacier console, go to S3 Glacier Console. 
Regions and Endpoints
You create a vault in a specific AWS Region. You always send your S3 Glacier requests to an endpoint specific to an AWS Region. For a list of the AWS Regions supported by S3 Glacier, go to Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.
