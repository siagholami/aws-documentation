Creating a Vault in Amazon S3 Glacier
Creating a vault adds a vault to the set of vaults in your account. An AWS account can create up to 1,000 vaults per AWS Region. For a list of the AWS Regions supported by Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier), see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference. For information on creating more vaults, go to the S3 Glacier product detail page. 
When you create a vault, you must provide a vault name. The following are the vault naming requirements: 
  Names can be between 1 and 255 characters long. 
 Allowed characters are a–z, A–Z, 0–9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), and '.' (period).
Vault names must be unique within an account and the AWS Region in which the vault is being created. That is, an account can create vaults with the same name in different AWS Regions but not in the same AWS Region.
