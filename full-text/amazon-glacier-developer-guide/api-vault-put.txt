Create Vault (PUT vault)
Description
This operation creates a new vault with the specified name.  The name of the vault must be unique within an AWS Region for an AWS account. You can create up to 1,000 vaults per account. For information on creating more vaults, go to the Amazon S3 Glacier product detail page.
You must use the following guidelines when naming a vault. 
  Names can be between 1 and 255 characters long. 
 Allowed characters are a–z, A–Z, 0–9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), and '.' (period).
This operation is idempotent, you can send the same request multiple times and it has no further effect after the first time Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) creates the specified vault.
