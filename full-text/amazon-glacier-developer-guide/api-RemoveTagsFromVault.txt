Remove Tags From Vault (POST tags remove)
This operation removes one or more tags from the set of tags attached to a vault. For more information about tags, see Tagging Amazon S3 Glacier Resources.
This operation is idempotent. The operation will be successful, even if there are no tags attached to the vault. 
Request Syntax
To remove tags from a vault, send an HTTP POST request to the tags URI as shown in the following syntax example.
POST /AccountId/vaults/vaultName/tags?operation=remove HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com

Note
The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
