Delete Vault Notifications (DELETE notification-configuration)
Description
This operation deletes the notification configuration set for a vault Set Vault Notification Configuration (PUT notification-configuration). The operation is eventually consistentâ€”that is, it might take some time for Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) to completely disable the notifications, and you might still receive some notifications for a short time after you send the delete request. 
Requests
To delete a vault's notification configuration, send a DELETE request to the vault's notification-configuration subresource.
Syntax
1. DELETE /AccountId/vaults/VaultName/notification-configuration HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
3. Date: Date
4. Authorization: SignatureValue
5. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
Note
The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
