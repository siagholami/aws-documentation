Locking a Vault by Using the Amazon S3 Glacier API
To lock your vault with the Glacier API, you first call Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy) with a vault lock policy that specifies the controls you want to deploy. Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy) attaches the policy to your vault, transitions the vault lock to the in-progress state, and returns a unique lock ID. After the vault lock enters the in-progress state, you have 24 hours to complete the lock by calling Complete Vault Lock (POST lockId) with the lock ID returned from Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy). After the vault is locked it cannot be unlocked.
If you don't complete the vault lock process within 24 hours after entering the in-progress state, your vault automatically exits the in-progress state, and the vault lock policy is removed. You can call Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy) again to install a new vault lock policy and transition into the in-progress state.
The in-progress state provides the opportunity to test your vault lock policy before you lock it. Your vault lock policy takes full effect during the in-progress state just as if the vault has been locked, except that you can remove the policy by calling Abort Vault Lock (DELETE lock-policy). To fine-tune your policy, you can repeat the Abort Vault Lock (DELETE lock-policy)/Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy) combination as many times as necessary to validate your vault lock policy changes.
After you validate the vault lock policy, you can call Complete Vault Lock (POST lockId) with the most recent lock ID to complete the vault locking process. Your vault transitions to a locked state where the vault lock policy is unchangeable and can no longer be removed by calling Abort Vault Lock (DELETE lock-policy).
