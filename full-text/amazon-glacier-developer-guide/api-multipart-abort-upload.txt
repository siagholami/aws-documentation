Abort Multipart Upload (DELETE uploadID)
Description
This multipart upload operation stops a multipart upload identified by the upload ID.
After the Abort Multipart Upload request succeeds, you cannot use the upload ID to upload any more parts or perform any other operations. Stopping a completed multipart upload fails. However, stopping an already-stopped upload will succeed, for a short time. 
This operation is idempotent. 
For information about multipart upload, see Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload).
Requests
To stop a multipart upload, send an HTTP DELETE request to the URI of the multipart-uploads subresource of the vault and identify the specific multipart upload ID as part of the URI.
Syntax
1. DELETE /AccountId/vaults/VaultName/multipart-uploads/uploadID HTTP/1.1

Note
The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
