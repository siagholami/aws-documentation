List Provisioned Capacity (GET provisioned-capacity)
This operation lists the provisioned capacity units for the specified AWS account. For more information about provisioned capacity, see Archive Retrieval Options. 
A provisioned capacity unit lasts for one month starting at the date and time of purchase, which is the start date. The unit expires on the expiration date, which is exactly one month after the start date to the nearest second. 
If the start date is on the 31st day of a month, the expiration date is the last day of the next month. For example, if the start date is August 31, the expiration date is September 30. If the start date is January 31, the expiration date is February 28. You can see this functionality in the Example Response.
