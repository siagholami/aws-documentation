Set Vault Notification Configuration (PUT notification-configuration)
Description
Retrieving an archive and a vault inventory are asynchronous operations in Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) for which you must first initiate a job and wait for the job to complete before you can download the job output. You can configure a vault to post a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when these jobs complete. You can use this operation to set notification configuration on the vault. For more information, see Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon S3 Glacier.  
To configure vault notifications, send a PUT request to the notification-configuration subresource of the vault. A notification configuration is specific to a vault; therefore, it is also referred to as a vault subresource. The request should include a JSON document that provides an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic and the events for which you want S3 Glacier to send notifications to the topic.
You can configure a vault to publish a notification for the following vault events:
 ArchiveRetrievalCompleted— This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an archive retrieval is completed (Initiate Job (POST jobs)). The status of the completed job can be Succeeded or Failed. The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from Describe Job (GET JobID).
 InventoryRetrievalCompleted— This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an inventory retrieval is completed (Initiate Job (POST jobs)). The status of the completed job can be Succeeded or Failed. The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from Describe Job (GET JobID).
Amazon SNS topics must grant permission to the vault to be allowed to publish notifications to the topic.
Requests
To set notification configuration on your vault, send a PUT request to the URI of the vault's notification-configuration subresource. You specify the configuration in the request body. The configuration includes the Amazon SNS topic name and an array of events that trigger notification to each topic.

Note
The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
