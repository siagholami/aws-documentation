Deploying a AWS CloudFormation Template in Eclipse
Note
Only files that end in .template can be launched from the Eclipse IDE. If your file ends with another extension, such as .json, you will need to rename it first with a .template extension to use this feature.
To deploy an CloudFormation template from Eclipse 


With your AWS CloudFormation.template file open in the AWS CloudFormation template editor (see Adding and Accessing AWS CloudFormation Templates in Eclipse for more information), right-click on the open template and select Run on AWS, then Create Stack on the context menu.



In the Create New CloudFormation Stack dialog, enter your stack name in the Stack Name field. Your template file should be automatically chosen in the Template File field.



Choose any (or none) of the following options:
SNS Topic– choose an existing SNS topic from the list to receive notifications about the stack’s progress, or create a new one by typing an email address in the box and clicking Create New Topic.
Creation Timeout– choose how long AWS CloudFormation should allow for the stack to be created before it is declared failed (and rolled back, unless the Rollback on failure option is unchecked.
Rollback on failure– if you want the stack to rollback (delete itself) on failure, check this option. Leave it unchecked if you would like the stack to remain active, for debugging purposes, even if it has failed to complete launching.


Click Next to continue with entering parameter values.


If your stack has parameters, you will enter values for them next. For parameters with a predefined list of possible responses, you can choose a value from the list provided.



Click Finish to begin launching your stack.


While your stack is being launched, you can view its status by double-clicking the stack name beneath the CloudFormation node in the AWS Explorer view, or by right-clicking the stack name and selecting Open in Stack Editor on the context menu.

Note
If you cannot see the stack you launched in AWS Explorer, you may need to manually refresh the view by clicking the Refresh AWS Explorer icon at the top of the AWS Explorer view.
