Viewing and Adding Amazon SNS Notifications
You can use the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse to view Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics associated with your application. Amazon SNS is a service that enables your application to send notifications, using a protocol such as email, when specified events occur. To learn more about Amazon SNS, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.
View an Amazon SNS Notification
The following process illustrates how to view an Amazon SNS notification.
To view a notification 


In AWS Explorer, click the triangle to the left of the Amazon SNS node to expand it and see the Amazon SNS topics it contains.



Double-click this SNS topic to open a detail view in the Eclipse editor pane. In this example, the Subscription ARN column says that the topic is pending confirmation. Amazon SNS requires a confirmation from the individual specified by the email address before SNS will send email notifications to that individual.



Add an Amazon SNS Notification
You can add new Amazon SNS notifications through AWS Explorer.
To add a new notification 


In AWS Explorer, right-click Amazon SNS, and then click Create New Topic. Enter a name for the new topic and click OK.



Double-click the new topic to display the detail view for the topic. Right-click in the Subscriptions area, and then click Create Subscription. Leave the Subscription Protocol box as Email (plain text) and enter an email address for the endpoint. Click OK . The detail view for the notification will now include this subscription.



To delete the subscription, right-click the entry in the Protocol column for the subscription and click Delete Subscription.


Note
The creation of the subscription will cause a verification email to be sent to the individual specified by the subscription “endpoint” email address. This email address will be used by AWS only to send notifications. It will not be used for any other purpose by AWS or Amazon.com.
