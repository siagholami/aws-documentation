Data encryption
Data encryption refers to protecting data while in-transit (as it travels to and from AWS IoT SiteWise, and between gateways and OPC-UA servers), and at rest (while it is stored on local devices or in AWS services). You can protect data in transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or at rest using client-side encryption.
