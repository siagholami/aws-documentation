Creating the AWS IoT SiteWise demo
You can create the AWS IoT SiteWise demo from the AWS IoT SiteWise or AWS CloudFormation consoles.
Note
The demo AWS CloudFormation template creates three Lambda functions, one CloudWatch Events rule, and the IAM roles required for the demo. You might see these resources in your AWS account. We recommend that you keep these resources until you're done with the demo. If you delete the resources, the demo might stop working correctly..
To create the demo in the AWS IoT SiteWise console


Navigate to the AWS IoT SiteWise console and find the SiteWise demo in the upper-right corner of the page.


(Optional) Under SiteWise demo, change the Days to keep demo assets field to specify how many days to keep the demo before deleting it.


Choose Create demo.


The demo takes around 3 minutes to create. If the demo fails to create, your account might have insufficient permissions. Switch to an account that has administrative permissions, or use the following steps to delete the demo and try again:


Choose Delete demo.
The demo takes around 15 minutes to delete.


If the demo doesn't delete, open the AWS CloudFormation console, choose the stack named IoTSiteWiseDemoAssets, and choose Delete in the upper-right corner.


If the demo fails to delete again, follow the steps in the AWS CloudFormation console to skip the resources that failed to delete, and try again.


After the demo creates successfully, you can explore the demo assets and data in the AWS IoT SiteWise console.

The stack takes around 15 minutes to delete.


If the demo fails to delete, choose Delete in the upper right corner again.
