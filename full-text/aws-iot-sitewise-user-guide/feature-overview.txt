Key components of AWS IoT SiteWise
The following are the core components of AWS IoT SiteWise:
 Gateway software – The AWS IoT SiteWise connector runs on any platform that supports AWS IoT Greengrass (version 1.10.0 or later). The connector polls data streams over the OPC-UA protocol and uploads the data to AWS IoT SiteWise over a secured internet connection. The connector also caches data locally in case internet connectivity is interrupted. To learn how to configure the AWS IoT SiteWise connector, see Ingesting data using a gateway.
 Gateway management – Tools that the AWS IoT SiteWise console provides so that you can configure your edge gateways and update existing gateway configurations. To learn how to configure gateways and sources, see Adding the gateway to AWS IoT SiteWise.
 Asset modeling – Tools provided in the AWS IoT SiteWise console to model assets, processes, and facilities. You can create multiple assets from asset models and uploaded data streams. You can define assets as children of other assets to represent processes and entire facilities, and you can define transforms and metrics that AWS IoT SiteWise computes from the uploaded data streams. AWS IoT SiteWise also automatically computes a set of basic aggregates for your data. To learn how to create models and assets, see Modeling industrial assets. To learn how to query aggregated asset property values, see Querying asset property aggregates.
 AWS IoT SiteWise Monitor – A data visualization and monitoring web application that you and others can access from any device. You can configure portals and dashboards with unique subsets of your industrial operation for your non-technical employees to gain insights from. To learn how to configure SiteWise Monitor, see Monitoring data with AWS IoT SiteWise Monitor. To learn how to use the SiteWise Monitor web application, see the AWS IoT SiteWise Monitor Application Guide.
 AWS IoT Core integration – An AWS IoT Core rules action to ingest data to AWS IoT SiteWise and an option to publish asset property values to MQTT topics for integration with other AWS services. To learn how to ingest data from AWS IoT Core, see Ingesting data using AWS IoT Core rules. To learn how to send asset property data to AWS IoT Core, see Interacting with other AWS services.
 CLI and SDKs – An API that lets you create, manage, and update your assets, portals, and dashboards. You can use the API to read assets' current, historical, and aggregated property values. You can also use the API to upload data to asset properties. The AWS IoT SiteWise API is available in the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and in SDKs for various programming languages.
