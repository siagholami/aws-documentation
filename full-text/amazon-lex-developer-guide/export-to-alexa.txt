Exporting to an Alexa Skill
You can export your bot schema in a format compatible with an Alexa skill. After you export the bot to a JSON file, you upload it to Alexa using the skill builder.
To export a bot and its schema (interaction model)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Lex console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/.


Choose the bot that you want to export.


For Actions, choose Export.


Choose the version of the bot that you want to export. For the format, choose Alexa Skills Kit, then choose Export. 


If a download dialog box appears, choose a location to save the file, then choose Save.


The downloaded file is a .zip archive containing one file with the name of the exported bot. It contains the information necessary to import the bot as an Alexa skill.
Note
Amazon Lex and the Alexa Skills Kit differ in the following ways:
Session attributes, denoted by square brackets ([]), are not supported by the Alexa Skills Kit. You need to update prompts that use session attributes.
Punctuation marks are not supported by the Alexa Skills Kit. You need to update utterances that use punctuation.
