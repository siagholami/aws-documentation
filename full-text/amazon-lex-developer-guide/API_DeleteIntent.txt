DeleteIntent
Deletes all versions of the intent, including the $LATEST version. To delete a specific version of the intent, use the DeleteIntentVersion operation.
You can delete a version of an intent only if it is not referenced. To delete an intent that is referred to in one or more bots (see Amazon Lex: How It Works), you must remove those references first. 
Note
 If you get the ResourceInUseException exception, it provides an example reference that shows where the intent is referenced. To remove the reference to the intent, either update the bot or delete it. If you get the same exception when you attempt to delete the intent again, repeat until the intent has no references and the call to DeleteIntent is successful. 
This operation requires permission for the lex:DeleteIntent action.
