Sentiment Analysis
You can use sentiment analysis to determine the sentiments expressed in a user utterance. With the sentiment information you can manage conversation flow or perform post-call analysis. For example, if the user sentiment is negative you can create a flow to hand over a conversation to a human agent.
Amazon Lex integrates with Amazon Comprehend to detect user sentiment. The response from Amazon Comprehend indicates whether the overall sentiment of the text is positive, neutral, negative, or mixed. The response contains the most likely sentiment for the user utterance and the scores for each of the sentiment categories. The score represents the likelihood that the sentiment was correctly detected.
You enable sentiment analysis for a bot using the console or by using the Amazon Lex API. On the Amazon Lex console, choose the Settings tab for your bot, then set the Sentiment Analysis option to Yes. If you are using the API, call the PutBot operation with the detectSentiment field set to true. 
When sentiment analysis is enabled, the response from the PostContent and PostText operations return a field called sentimentResponse in the bot response with other metadata. The sentimentResponse field has two fields, SentimentLabel and SentimentScore, that contain the result of the sentiment analysis. If you are using a Lambda function, the sentimentResponse field is included in the event data sent to your function.
The following is an example of the sentimentResponse field returned as part of the PostText or PostContent response. The SentimentScore field is a string that contains the scores for the response.

    "SentimentScore": 
        "{

        Neutral: 0.0141543131828308,
        Negative: 0.00893945890665054
        }",
    "SentimentLabel": "POSITIVE"
