In the preceding section, you tested the ScheduleAppointment bot using the client in the Amazon Lex console. Currently, the Amazon Lex console does not support response cards. To test the dynamically generated response cards that the bot supports, deploy the bot on the Facebook Messenger platform and test it.
For instructions, see Integrating an Amazon Lex Bot with Facebook Messenger.
