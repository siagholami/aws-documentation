Sample Utterances
When you develop a bot, you can provide sample utterances for each intent and slot. You can also provide custom values and synonyms for slots. This information is used only to build the bot and to create the user experience. It isn't encrypted. 
Customer Utterances
Amazon Lex encrypts utterances that users send to your bot unless the childDirected field is set to true.
When the childDirected field is set to true, no user utterances are stored.
When the childDirected field is set to false (the default), user utterances are encrypted and stored for 15 days for use with the GetUtterancesView operation. To delete stored utterances for a specific user, use the DeleteUtterances operation .
When your bot accepts voice input, the input is stored indefinitely. Amazon Lex uses it to improve your bot's ability to respond to user input.
Use the DeleteUtterances operation to delete stored utterances for a specific user.
Session Attributes
Session attributes contain application-specific information that is passed between Amazon Lex and client applications. Amazon Lex passes session attributes to all AWS Lambda functions configured for a bot. If a Lambda function adds or updates session attributes, Amazon Lex passes the new information back to the client application.
Session attributes persist in an encrypted store for the duration of the session. You can configure the session to remain active for a minimum of 1 minute and up to 24 hours after the last user utterance. The default session duration is 5 minutes.
Request Attributes
Request attributes contain request-specific information and apply only to the current request. A client application uses request attributes to send information to Amazon Lex at runtime. 
You use request attributes to pass information that doesn't need to persist for the entire session. Because request attributes don't persist across requests, they aren't stored.
