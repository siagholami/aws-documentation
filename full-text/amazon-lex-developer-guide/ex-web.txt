Example: Integrating with a Web site
In this example you integrate a bot with a Web site using text and voice. You use JavaScript and AWS services to build an interactive experience for visitors to your Web site. You can choose from these examples documented on the AWS AI Blog:
  Deploy a Web UI for Your Chatbot—Demonstrates a full-featured Web UI that provides a Web client for Amazon Lex chatbots. You can use this to learn about Web clients, or as a building block for your own application.
 "Greetings, visitor!"—Engage Your Web Users with Amazon Lex—Demonstrates using Amazon Lex, the AWS SDK for JavaScript in the Browser, and Amazon Cognito to create a conversational experience on your Web site.
 Capturing Voice Input in a Browser and Sending it to Amazon Lex—Demonstrates embedding a voice-based chatbot in a Web site using the SDK for JavaScript in the Browser. The application records audio, sends the audio to Amazon Lex, and then plays the response.
