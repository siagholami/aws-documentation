Step 3: Create a Lambda Function (Console)
Create a Lambda function (using the lex-order-flowers-python blueprint) and perform test invocation using sample event data in the AWS Lambda console. 
You return to the Amazon Lex console and add the Lambda function as the code hook to fulfill the OrderFlowers intent in the OrderFlowersBot that you created in the preceding section.
To create the Lambda function (console)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.


Choose Create function.


On the Create function page, choose Use a blueprint. Type lex- in the filter text box and then press Enter to find the blueprint, choose the lex-order-flowers-python blueprint. 


Lambda function blueprints are provided in both Node.js and Python. For this exercise, use the Python-based blueprint.


On the Basic information page, do the following. 
    Type a Lambda function name (OrderFlowersCodeHook).
    For the execution role, choose Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions.
    Leave the other default values.


Choose Create function.


Test the Lambda function.


Choose Select a test event, Configure test events.


Choose Amazon Lex Order Flowers from the Event template list. This sample event matches the Amazon Lex request/response model (see Using Lambda Functions). Give the test event a name (LexOrderFlowersTest).


Choose Create.


Choose Test to test the code hook.


Verify that the Lambda function ran successfully. The response in this case matches the Amazon Lex response model.
