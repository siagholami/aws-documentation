Step 2: Create an Amazon Lex Bot
Amazon Lex provides an interface between the call center agent and the Amazon Kendra index. It keeps track of the conversation between the agent and the customer and calls the AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent intent based on the questions the customer asks. An intent is an action that the user wants to perform.
Amazon Kendra searches the indexed documents and returns an answer to Amazon Lex that it displays in the bot. This answer is visible only to the agent.
