Monitoring Amazon Lex with Amazon CloudWatch
To track the health of your Amazon Lex bots, use Amazon CloudWatch. With CloudWatch, you can get metrics for individual Amazon Lex operations or for global Amazon Lex operations for your account. You can also set up CloudWatch alarms to be notified when one or more metrics exceeds a threshold that you define. For example, you can monitor the number of requests made to a bot over a particular time period, view the latency of successful requests, or raise an alarm when errors exceed a threshold.
CloudWatch Metrics for Amazon Lex
To get metrics for your Amazon Lex operations , you must specify the following information:
 The metric dimension. A dimension is a set of name-value pairs that you use to identify a metric. Amazon Lex has three dimensions: 
   BotAlias, BotName, Operation
   BotAlias, BotName, InputMode, Operation
   BotName, BotVersion, InputMode, Operation
 The metric name, such as MissedUtteranceCount or RuntimeRequestCount.
You can get metrics for Amazon Lex with the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the CloudWatch API. You can use the CloudWatch API through one of the Amazon AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs) or the CloudWatch API tools. The Amazon Lex console displays graphs based on the raw data from the CloudWatch API. 
You must have the appropriate CloudWatch permissions to monitor Amazon Lex with CloudWatch . For more information, see  Authentication and Access Control for Amazon CloudWatch in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

Creating an Alarm
A CloudWatch alarm watches a single metric over a specified time period, and performs one or more actions: sending a notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service  (Amazon SNS) topic or Auto Scaling policy. The action or actions are based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods that you specify. CloudWatch can also send you an Amazon SNS message when the alarm changes state. 
CloudWatch alarms invoke actions only when the state changes and has persisted for the period that you specify.
