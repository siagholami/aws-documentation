Step 3: Add a Custom and Built-in Intent
An intent represents an action that the call center agent wants the bot to perform. In this case, the agent wants the bot to suggest responses and helpful resources based on the agent's conversation with the customer. 
Amazon Lex has two types of intents: custom intents and built-in intents. AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent is a built-in intent. The bot uses the AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent intent to query the index and display the responses suggested by Amazon Kendra. 
The bot in this example doesn't need a custom intent. However, to build the bot, you must create at least one custom intent with at least one sample utterance. This intent is required only to build your agent assistant bot. It doesnâ€™t perform any other function. The utterance for the intent must not answer any of the questions that the customer might ask. This ensures that the AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent is called to answer customer queries. For more information, see AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent in the Amazon Lex Developer Guide.
