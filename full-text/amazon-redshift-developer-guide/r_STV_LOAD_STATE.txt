STV_LOAD_STATE
Use the STV_LOAD_STATE table to find information about current state of ongoing COPY statements.
The COPY command updates this table after every million records are loaded.
STV_LOAD_STATE is visible to all users. Superusers can see all rows; regular users can see only their own data. For more information, see Visibility of data in system tables and views.

Sample query
To view the progress of each slice for a COPY command, type the following query. This example uses the PG_LAST_COPY_ID() function to retrieve information for the last COPY command.
```
select slice , bytes_loaded, bytes_to_load , pct_complete from stv_load_state where query = pg_last_copy_id();
slice | bytes_loaded | bytes_to_load | pct_complete 
--------------------------------------------------
     2 |            0 |             0 |            0
     3 |     12840898 |      39104640 |           32
