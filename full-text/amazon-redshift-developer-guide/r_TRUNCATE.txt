TRUNCATE
Deletes all of the rows from a table without doing a table scan: this operation is a faster alternative to an unqualified DELETE operation. To execute a TRUNCATE command, you must be the owner of the table or a superuser.
TRUNCATE is much more efficient than DELETE and doesn't require a VACUUM and ANALYZE. However, be aware that TRUNCATE commits the transaction in which it is run.
Syntax
TRUNCATE [ TABLE ] table_name
Parameters
TABLE 
Optional keyword. 
table_name 
A temporary or persistent table. Only the owner of the table or a superuser may truncate it. 
You can truncate any table, including tables that are referenced in foreign-key constraints. 
You don't need to vacuum a table after truncating it. 
Usage notes
The TRUNCATE command commits the transaction in which it is run; therefore, you can't roll back a TRUNCATE operation, and a TRUNCATE command may commit other operations when it commits itself. 
Examples
Use the TRUNCATE command to delete all of the rows from the CATEGORY table: 
truncate category;
Attempt to roll back a TRUNCATE operation: 
```
begin;
truncate date;
rollback;
select count(*) from date;
count

0
(1 row)
```
The DATE table remains empty after the ROLLBACK command because the TRUNCATE command committed automatically.
