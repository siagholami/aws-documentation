Step 2: Add the Amazon Redshift cluster public key to the host's authorized keys file
You add the cluster public key to each host's authorized keys file so that the host will recognize Amazon Redshift and accept the SSH connection. 
To add the Amazon Redshift cluster public key to the host's authorized keys file

Access the host using an SSH connection. 

For information about connecting to an instance using SSH, see Connect to Your Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. 


Copy the Amazon Redshift public key from the console or from the CLI response text. 


Copy and paste the contents of the public key into the /home/<ssh_username>/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote host. The <ssh_username> must match the value for the "username" field in the manifest file. Include the complete string, including the prefix "ssh-rsa " and suffix "Amazon-Redshift". For example: 


ssh-rsa AAAACTP3isxgGzVWoIWpbVvRCOzYdVifMrhâ€¦ uA70BnMHCaMiRdmvsDOedZDOedZ Amazon-Redshift
