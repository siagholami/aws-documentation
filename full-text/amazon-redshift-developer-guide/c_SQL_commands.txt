Amazon Redshift is based on PostgreSQL 8.0.2. Amazon Redshift and PostgreSQL have a number of very important differences that you must be aware of as you design and develop your data warehouse applications. For more information about how Amazon Redshift SQL differs from PostgreSQL, see Amazon Redshift and PostgreSQL.
