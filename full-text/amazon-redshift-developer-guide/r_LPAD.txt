LPAD and RPAD functions
These functions prepend or append characters to a string, based on a specified length. 
Syntax
LPAD (string1, length, [ string2 ])
RPAD (string1, length, [ string2 ])
Arguments
string1 
A character string or an expression that evaluates to a character string, such as the name of a character column. 
length 
An integer that defines the length of the result of the function. The length of a string is based on the number of characters, not bytes, so that multi-byte characters are counted as single characters. If string1 is longer than the specified length, it is truncated (on the right). If length is a negative number, the result of the function is an empty string.
string2 
One or more characters that are prepended or appended to string1. This argument is optional; if it is not specified, spaces are used. 
Return type
These functions return a VARCHAR data type. 
Examples
Truncate a specified set of event names to 20 characters and prepend the shorter names with spaces: 
```
select lpad(eventname,20) from event
where eventid between 1 and 5 order by 1;
lpad
          Salome
    Il Trovatore
   Boris Godunov
 Gotterdammerung

La Cenerentola (Cind
(5 rows)
```
Truncate the same set of event names to 20 characters but append the shorter names with 0123456789. 
```
select rpad(eventname,20,'0123456789') from event
where eventid between 1 and 5 order by 1;
