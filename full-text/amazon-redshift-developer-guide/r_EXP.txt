Syntax
EXP (expression)
Argument
expression 
The expression must be an INTEGER, DECIMAL, or DOUBLE PRECISION data type. 
Return type
EXP returns a DOUBLE PRECISION number. 
Example
Use the EXP function to forecast ticket sales based on a continuous growth pattern. In this example, the subquery returns the number of tickets sold in 2008. That result is multiplied by the result of the EXP function, which specifies a continuous growth rate of 7% over 10 years. 
```
select (select sum(qtysold) from sales, date
where sales.dateid=date.dateid
and year=2008) * exp((7::float/100)*10) qty2018;
qty2018
