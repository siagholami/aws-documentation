November 16, 2017


Short query acceleration in Amazon Redshift workload management (WLM)
Short query acceleration (SQA) prioritizes selected short-running queries ahead of longer-running queries. SQA executes short-running queries in a dedicated space, so that SQA queries aren't forced to wait in queues behind longer queries. With SQA, short-running queries begin executing more quickly and users see results sooner. For more information, see Working with short query acceleration.
November 16, 2017


WLM reassigns hopped queries
Instead of canceling and restarting a hopped query, Amazon Redshift workload management (WLM) now reassigns eligible queries to a new queue. When WLM reassigns a query, it moves the query to the new queue and continues execution, which saves time and system resources. Hopped queries that are not eligible to be reassigned are restarted or canceled. For more information, see WLM query queue hopping.
November 16, 2017


System log access for users
In most system log tables that are visible to users, rows generated by another user are invisible to a regular user by default. To permit a regular user to see all rows in user-visible tables, including rows generated by another user, run ALTER USER or CREATE USER and set the SYSLOG ACCESS parameter to UNRESTRICTED.
November 16, 2017


Result caching
With  Result caching , when you run a query Amazon Redshift caches the result. When you run the query again, Amazon Redshift checks for a valid, cached copy of the query result. If a match is found in the result cache, Amazon Redshift uses the cached result and doesn't execute the query. Result caching is enabled by default. To disable result caching, set the enable_result_cache_for_session configuration parameter to off.
November 16, 2017


Column metadata functions
PG_GET_COLS and PG_GET_LATE_BINDING_VIEW_COLS return column metadata for Amazon Redshift tables, views, and late-binding views.

Skip header lines in external tables
You can set the skip.header.line.count property in the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE command to skip header lines at the beginning of Redshift Spectrum data files.
October 5, 2017


Scan row count
WLM query monitor rules uses the scan_row_count metric to return the number of rows in a scan step. The row count is the total number of rows emitted before filtering rows marked for deletion (ghost rows) and before applying user-defined query filters. For more information, see Query monitoring metrics.
September 21, 2017


SQL user-defined functions
A scalar SQL user-defined function (UDF) incorporates a SQL SELECT clause that executes when the function is called and returns a single value. For more information, see Creating a scalar SQL UDF.
August 31, 2017


Late-binding views
A late-binding view is not bound to the underlying database objects, such as tables and user-defined functions. As a result, there is no dependency between the view and the objects it references. You can create a view even if the referenced objects don't exist. Because there is no dependency, you can drop or alter a referenced object without affecting the view. Amazon Redshift doesn't check for dependencies until the view is queried. To create a late-binding view, specify the WITH NO SCHEMA BINDING clause with your CREATE VIEW statement. For more information, see CREATE VIEW.
August 31, 2017


OCTET_LENGTH function
OCTET_LENGTH returns the length of the specified string as the number of bytes.

July 7, 2017


UNLOAD to smaller file sizes
By default, UNLOAD creates multiple files on Amazon S3 with a maximum size of 6.2 GB. To create smaller files, specify the MAXFILESIZE with the UNLOAD command. You can specify a maximum file size between 5 MB and 6.2 GB. For more information, see UNLOAD.
July 7, 2017


TABLE PROPERTIES
You can now set the TABLE PROPERTIES numRows parameter for CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE or ALTER TABLE to update table statistics to reflect the number of rows in the table.
June 6, 2017


ANALYZE PREDICATE COLUMNS
To save time and cluster resources, you can choose to analyze only the columns that are likely to be used as predicates. When you run ANALYZE with the PREDICATE COLUMNS clause, the analyze operation includes only columns that have been used in a join, filter condition, or group by clause, or are used as a sort key or distribution key. For more information, see Analyzing tables.
May 25, 2017

You define query monitoring rules as part of your workload management (WLM) configuration. For more information, see WLM query monitoring rules.
April 21, 2017


Amazon Redshift Spectrum
Using Redshift Spectrum, you can efficiently query and retrieve data from files in Amazon S3 without having to load the data into tables. Redshift Spectrum queries execute very fast against large datasets because Redshift Spectrum scans the data files directly in Amazon S3. Much of the processing occurs in the Amazon Redshift Spectrum layer, and most of the data remains in Amazon S3. Multiple clusters can concurrently query the same dataset on Amazon S3 without the need to make copies of the data for each cluster. For more information, see Querying external data using Amazon Redshift Spectrum
April 19, 2017

September 29, 2016


Analyze threshold
To reduce processing time and improve overall system performance for ANALYZE operations, Amazon Redshift skips analyzing a table if the percentage of rows that have changed since the last ANALYZE command run is lower than the analyze threshold specified by the analyze_threshold_percent parameter. By default, analyze_threshold_percent is 10.
August 9, 2016


New STL_RESTARTED_SESSIONS system table
When Amazon Redshift restarts a session, STL_RESTARTED_SESSIONS records the new process ID (PID) and the old PID.
August 9, 2016

April 21, 2016


No-backup tables
For tables, such as staging tables, that won't contain critical data, you can specify BACKUP NO in your CREATE TABLE or CREATE TABLE AS statement to prevent Amazon Redshift from including the table in automated or manual snapshots. Using no-backup tables saves processing time when creating snapshots and restoring from snapshots and reduces storage space on Amazon S3.
April 7, 2016


VACUUM delete threshold
By default, the VACUUM command now reclaims space such that at least 95 percent of the remaining rows are not marked for deletion. As a result, VACUUM usually needs much less time for the delete phase compared to reclaiming 100 percent of deleted rows. You can change the default threshold for a single table by including the TO threshold PERCENT parameter when you run the VACUUM command.
April 7, 2016


SVV_TRANSACTIONS system table
The SVV_TRANSACTIONS system view records information about transactions that currently hold locks on tables in the database.
April 7, 2016


Using IAM roles to access other AWS resources
To move data between your cluster and another AWS resource, such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon EMR, or Amazon EC2, your cluster must have permission to access the resource and perform the necessary actions. As a more secure alternative to providing an access key pair with COPY, UNLOAD, or CREATE LIBRARY commands, you can now you specify an IAM role that your cluster uses for authentication and authorization. For more information, see Role-based access control.
March 29, 2016


VACUUM sort threshold
The VACUUM command now skips the sort phase for any table where more than 95 percent of the table's rows are already sorted. You can change the default sort threshold for a single table by including the TO threshold PERCENT parameter when you run the VACUUM command.
March 17, 2016


New columns in STL_CONNECTION_LOG
The STL_CONNECTION_LOG system table has three new columns. If you routinely load audit logs to an Amazon Redshift table, you will need to add the following new columns to the target table: sslversion, sslcipher, and mtu.
March 17, 2016


UNLOAD with bzip2 compression
You now have the option to UNLOAD using bzip2 compression.
February 8, 2016


ALTER TABLE APPEND
ALTER TABLE APPEND appends rows to a target table by moving data from an existing source table. ALTER TABLE APPEND is usually much faster than a similar CREATE TABLE AS or INSERT INTO operation because data is moved, not duplicated.
February 8, 2016


WLM query queue hopping
If workload management (WLM) cancels a read-only query, such as a SELECT statement, due to a WLM timeout, WLM attempts to route the query to the next matching queue. For more information, see WLM query queue hopping
January 7, 2016


ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES
You can use the ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES command to define the default set of access privileges to be applied to objects that are created in the future by the specified user.
December 10, 2015

November 19, 2015


REGION keyword for CREATE LIBRARY
If the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the UDF library files does not reside in the same AWS Region as your Amazon Redshift cluster, you can use the REGION option to specify the region in which the data is located. For more information, see CREATE LIBRARY.
November 19, 2015


User-defined scalar functions (UDFs)
You can now create custom user-defined scalar functions to implement non-SQL processing functionality provided either by Amazon Redshift-supported modules in the Python 2.7 Standard Library or your own custom UDFs based on the Python programming language. For more information, see Creating user-defined functions.
September 11, 2015


Dynamic properties in WLM configuration
The WLM configuration parameter now supports applying some properties dynamically. Other properties remain static changes and require that associated clusters be rebooted so that the configuration changes can be applied. For more information, see WLM dynamic and static configuration properties and Implementing workload management.
August 3, 2015


LISTAGG function
The LISTAGG function and LISTAGG window function return a string created by concatenating a set of column values.
July 30, 2015


Deprecated parameter
The max_cursor_result_set_size configurationÂ parameter is deprecated. The size of cursor result sets are constrained based on the cluster's node type. For more information, see Cursor constraints.
July 24, 2015


Revised COPY command documentation
The COPY command reference has been extensively revised to make the material friendlier and more accessible.
July 15, 2015


COPY from Avro format
The COPY command supports loading data in Avro format from data files on Amazon S3, Amazon EMR, and from remote hosts using SSH. For more information, see AVRO and Copy from Avro examples.
July 8, 2015


STV_STARTUP_RECOVERY_STATE
The STV_STARTUP_RECOVERY_STATE system table records the state of tables that are temporarily locked during cluster restart operations. Amazon Redshift places a temporary lock on tables while they are being processed to resolve stale transactions following a cluster restart.
May 25, 2015


ORDER BY optional for ranking functions
The ORDER BY clause is now optional for certain window ranking functions. For more information, see CUME_DIST window function, DENSE_RANK window function, RANK window function, NTILE window function, PERCENT_RANK window function, and ROW_NUMBER window function.
May 25, 2015


Interleaved sort keys
Interleaved sort keys give equal weight to each column in the sort key. Using interleaved sort keys instead of the default compound keys significantly improves performance for queries that use restrictive predicates on secondary sort columns, especially for large tables. Interleaved sorting also improves overall performance when multiple queries filter on different columns in the same table. For more information, see Choosing sort keys and CREATE TABLE.
May 11, 2015


Revised tuning query performance topic
Tuning query performance has been expanded to include new queries for analyzing query performance and more examples. Also, the topic has been revised to be clearer and more complete.
