Use a bulk insert
Use a bulk insert operation with a SELECT clause for high-performance data insertion.
Use the INSERT and CREATE TABLE AS commands when you need to move data or a subset of data from one table into another.
For example, the following INSERT statement selects all of the rows from the CATEGORY table and inserts them into the CATEGORY_STAGE table.
insert into category_stage
(select * from category);
The following example creates CATEGORY_STAGE as a copy of CATEGORY and inserts all of the rows in CATEGORY into CATEGORY_STAGE. 
create table category_stage as
select * from category;
