STL_FILE_SCAN
Returns the files that Amazon Redshift read while loading data via the COPY command.
Querying this view can help troubleshoot data load errors. STL_FILE_SCAN can be particularly helpful with pinpointing issues in parallel data loads because parallel data loads typically load many files with a single COPY command.
This view is visible to all users. Superusers can see all rows; regular users can see only their own data. For more information, see Visibility of data in system tables and views.

Sample queries
The following query retrieves the names and load times of any files that took over 1000000 microseconds for Amazon Redshift to read:
select trim(name)as name, loadtime from stl_file_scan
where loadtime > 1000000;
This query returns the following example output:
name            | loadtime
