extra_float_digits
Values (default in bold)
0, -15 to 2 
Description
Sets the number of digits displayed for floating-point values, including float4 and float8. The value is added to the standard number of digits (FLT_DIG or DBL_DIG as appropriate). The value can be set as high as 2, to include partially significant digits; this is especially useful for outputting float data that needs to be restored exactly. Or it can be set negative to suppress unwanted digits.
