SVL_STATEMENTTEXT
Use the SVL_STATEMENTTEXT view to get a complete record of all of the SQL commands that have been run on the system.
The SVL_STATEMENTTEXT view contains the union of all of the rows in the STL_DDLTEXT, STL_QUERYTEXT, and STL_UTILITYTEXT tables. This view also includes a join to the STL_QUERY table.
SVL_STATEMENTTEXT is visible to all users. Superusers can see all rows; regular users can see only their own data. For more information, see Visibility of data in system tables and views.

Sample query
The following query returns DDL statements that were run on June 16th, 2009: 
```
select starttime, type, rtrim(text) from svl_statementtext
where starttime like '2009-06-16%' and type='DDL' order by starttime asc;



starttime
type
rtrim




2009-06-16 10:36:50.625097
DDL
create table ddltest(c1 int);


2009-06-16 15:02:16.006341
DDL
drop view alltickitjoin;


2009-06-16 15:02:23.65285

Reconstructing stored SQL
To reconstruct the SQL stored in the text column of SVL_STATEMENTTEXT, run a SELECT statement to create SQL from 1 or more parts in the text column. Before running the reconstructed SQL, replace any (\n) special characters with a new line. The result of the following SELECT statement is rows of reconstructed SQL in the query_statement field.
select LISTAGG(CASE WHEN LEN(RTRIM(text)) = 0 THEN text ELSE RTRIM(text) END, '') within group (order by sequence) AS query_statement 
from SVL_STATEMENTTEXT where pid=pg_backend_pid();
For example, the following query selects 3 columns. The query itself is longer than 200 characters and is stored in parts in SVL_STATEMENTTEXT.
select
1 AS a0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890,
2 AS b0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890,
3 AS b012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234
FROM stl_querytext;
In this example, the query is stored in 2 parts (rows) in the text column of SVL_STATEMENTTEXT.
select sequence, text from SVL_STATEMENTTEXT where pid = pg_backend_pid() order by starttime, sequence;
sequence |                                                                                             text

        1 | \nFROM stl_querytext;
To reconstruct the SQL stored in STL_STATEMENTTEXT, run the following SQL. 
select LISTAGG(CASE WHEN LEN(RTRIM(text)) = 0 THEN text ELSE RTRIM(text) END, '') within group (order by sequence) AS text 
from SVL_STATEMENTTEXT where pid=pg_backend_pid();
To use the resulting reconstructed SQL in your client, replace any (\n) special characters with a new line.
