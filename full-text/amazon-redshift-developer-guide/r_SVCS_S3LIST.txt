SVCS_S3LIST
Use the SVCS_S3LIST view to get details about Amazon Redshift Spectrum queries at the segment level. One segment can perform one external table scan. This view is derived from the SVL_S3LIST system view but doesn't show slice-level for queries run on a concurrency scaling cluster. 
Note
System views with the prefix SVCS provide details about queries on both the main and concurrency scaling clusters. The views are similar to the views with the prefix SVL except that the SVL views provide information only for queries run on the main cluster.
SVCS_S3LIST is visible to all users. Superusers can see all rows; regular users can see only their own data. For more information, see Visibility of data in system tables and views.
For information about SVL_S3LIST, see SVL_S3LIST.
