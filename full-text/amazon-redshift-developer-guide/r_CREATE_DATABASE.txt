CREATE DATABASE
Creates a new database.
You can't run CREATE DATABASE within a transaction block (BEGIN ... END). For more information about transactions, see Serializable isolation. 
Syntax
CREATE DATABASE database_name [ WITH ]
[ OWNER [=] db_owner ]
[ CONNECTION LIMIT { limit | UNLIMITED } ]
Parameters
database_name 
Name of the new database. For more information about valid names, see Names and identifiers.
WITH 
Optional keyword.
OWNER 
Specifies a database owner.
= 
Optional character.
db_owner 
Username for the database owner.
CONNECTION LIMIT { limit | UNLIMITED } 
The maximum number of database connections users are permitted to have open concurrently. The limit isn't enforced for super users. Use the UNLIMITED keyword to permit the maximum number of concurrent connections.  A limit on the number of connections for each user might also apply. For more information, see CREATE USER. The default is UNLIMITED. To view current connections, query the STV_SESSIONS system view.
If both user and database connection limits apply, an unused connection slot must be available that is within both limits when a user attempts to connect.
CREATE DATABASE limits
Amazon Redshift enforces these limits for databases.
 Maximum of 60 user-defined databases per cluster.
 Maximum of 127 bytes for a database name.
 Cannot be a reserved word.
Examples
The following example creates a database named TICKIT and gives ownership to the user DWUSER: 
create database tickit
with owner dwuser;
Query the PG_DATABASE_INFO catalog table to view details about databases. 
```
select datname, datdba, datconnlimit 
from pg_database_info
where datdba > 1;
datname     | datdba | datconnlimit
----------------------------------
 admin       |    100 | UNLIMITED 
 reports     |    100 | 100       
 tickit      |    100 | 100
```
