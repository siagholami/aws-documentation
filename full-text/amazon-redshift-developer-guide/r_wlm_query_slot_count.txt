wlm_query_slot_count
Values (default in bold)
1, 1 to 50 (cannot exceed number of available slots (concurrency level) for the service class)
Description
Sets the number of query slots a query uses.
Workload management (WLM) reserves slots in a service class according to the concurrency level set for the queue (for example, if concurrency level is set to 5, then the service class has 5 slots). WLM allocates the available memory for a service class equally to each slot. For more information, see Implementing workload management. 
Note
If the value of wlm_query_slot_count is larger than the number of available slots (concurrency level) for the service class, the query fails. If you encounter an error, decrease wlm_query_slot_count to an allowable value.
For operations where performance is heavily affected by the amount of memory allocated, such as Vacuum, increasing the value of wlm_query_slot_count can improve performance. In particular, for slow Vacuum commands, inspect the corresponding record in the SVV_VACUUM_SUMMARY view. If you see high values (close to or higher than 100) for sort_partitions and merge_increments in the SVV_VACUUM_SUMMARY view, consider increasing the value for wlm_query_slot_count the next time you run Vacuum against that table.
Increasing the value of wlm_query_slot_count limits the number of concurrent queries that can be run. For example, suppose the service class has a concurrency level of 5 and wlm_query_slot_count is set to 3. While a query is running within the session with wlm_query_slot_count set to 3, a maximum of 2 more concurrent queries can be executed within the same service class. Subsequent queries wait in the queue until currently executing queries complete and slots are freed.
Examples
Use the SET command to set the value of wlm_query_slot_count for the duration of the current session. 
set wlm_query_slot_count to 3;
