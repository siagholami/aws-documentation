Tutorial: Tuning table design
In this tutorial, you will learn how to optimize the design of your tables. You will start by creating tables based on the Star Schema Benchmark (SSB) schema without sort keys, distribution styles, and compression encodings. You will load the tables with test data and test system performance. Next, you will apply best practices to recreate the tables using sort keys and distribution styles. You will load the tables with test data using automatic compression and then you will test performance again so that you can compare the performance benefits of well-designed tables.
Estimated time: 60 minutes
Estimated cost: $1.00 per hour for the cluster
Prerequisites
You will need your AWS credentials (access key ID and secret access key) to load test data from Amazon S3. If you need to create new access keys, go to Administering Access Keys for IAM Users.
Steps

Step 1: Create a test data set 
Step 2: Test system performance to establish a baseline
Step 3: Select sort keys 
Step 4: Select distribution styles
Step 5: Review compression encodings 
Step 6: Recreate the test data set
Step 7: Retest system performance after tuning
Step 8: Evaluate the results 
Step 9: Clean up your resources
