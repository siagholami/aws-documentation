Summary
In this tutorial, you uploaded data files to Amazon S3 and then used COPY commands to load the data from the files into Amazon Redshift tables.
You loaded data using the following formats:
 Character-delimited
 CSV
 Fixed-width
You used the STL_LOAD_ERRORS system table to troubleshoot load errors, and then used the REGION, MANIFEST, MAXERROR, ACCEPTINVCHARS, DATEFORMAT, and NULL AS options to resolve the errors.
You applied the following best practices for loading data: 
 Use a COPY command to load data
 Split your load data into multiple files
 Use a single COPY command to load from multiple files
 Compress your data files
 Use a manifest file
 Verify data files before and after a load
