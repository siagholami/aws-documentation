Arguments

{date|timestamp}
A date or timestamp column or an expression that implicitly converts to a date or time stamp. The expression must be a date or time stamp expression that contains the specified datepart.

Examples
Apply the DATE_PART function to a column in a table: 
```
select date_part(w, listtime) as weeks, listtime
from listing where listid=10;
weeks |      listtime
---------------------------
 25   | 2008-06-17 09:44:54
(1 row)
```
You can name dateparts in full or abbreviate them; in this case, w stands for weeks. 
The day of week datepart returns an integer from 0-6, starting with Sunday. Use DATE_PART with dow (DAYOFWEEK) to view events on a Saturday. 
```
select date_part(dow, starttime) as dow,
starttime from event
where date_part(dow, starttime)=6
order by 2,1;
dow |      starttime
