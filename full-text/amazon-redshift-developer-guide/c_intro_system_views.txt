System views
System views contain a subset of data found in several of the STL views and STV system tables.
These views provide quicker and easier access to commonly queried data found in those tables.
System views with the prefix SVCS provide details about queries on both the main and concurrency scaling clusters. The views are similar to the views with the prefix SVL except that the SVL views provide information only for queries run on the main cluster.
