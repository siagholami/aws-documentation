Nulls
If a column in a row is missing, unknown, or not applicable, it is a null value or is said to contain null. Nulls can appear in fields of any data type that are not restricted by primary key or NOT NULL constraints. A null is not equivalent to the value zero or to an empty string.
Any arithmetic expression containing a null always evaluates to a null. All operators except concatenation return a null when given a null argument or operand.
To test for nulls, use the comparison conditions IS NULL and IS NOT NULL. Because null represents a lack of data, a null is not equal or unequal to any value or to another null.
