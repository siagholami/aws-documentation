Usage notes
If you see multiple errors with "Connection timed out", you might have a networking issue. If you're using Enhanced VPC Routing, verify that you have a valid network path between your cluster's VPC and your data resources. For more information, see Amazon Redshift Enhanced VPC Routing
Sample query
The following query returns the errors from COPY commands executed during the current session.
select query, sliceid, substring(key from 1 for 20) as file, 
substring(error from 1 for 35) as error  
from stl_s3client_error 
where pid = pg_backend_pid()
order by query desc;
Result
query  | sliceid |     file           |              error
