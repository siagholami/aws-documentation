Step 1: Create a cluster
If you already have a cluster that you want to use, you can skip this step. 
For the exercises in this tutorial, use a four-node cluster.

To create a cluster


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.
Important
If you use IAM user credentials, make sure that you have the necessary permissions to perform the cluster operations. For more information, see Controlling access to IAM users in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.


At top right, choose the AWS Region in which you want to create the cluster. For the purposes of this tutorial, choose US West (Oregon).


On the navigation menu, choose CLUSTERS, then choose Create cluster. The Create cluster page appears. 


Choose dc2.large for the node type in the Compute optimized section. Then choose 4 for the Nodes. 


In the Cluster details section, specify values for Cluster identifier, Database port, Master user name, and Master user password. 


In the Cluster permissions section, choose an IAM role from Available IAM roles. This role should be one that you previously created and that has access to Amazon S3. Then choose Add IAM role to add it to the list of Attached IAM roles for the cluster.


Choose Create cluster. 


Original console
Follow the steps in Amazon Redshift Getting Started, but choose Multi Node for Cluster Type and set Number of Compute Nodes to 4.

Follow the Amazon Redshift Getting Started steps to connect to your cluster from a SQL client and test a connection. You don't need to complete the remaining Getting Started steps to create tables, upload data, and try example queries.
