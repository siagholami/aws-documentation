ST_IsClosed
ST_IsClosed returns true if the input geometry is closed. The following rules define a closed geometry: 
 The input geometry is a point or a multipoint. 
 The input geometry is a linestring, and the start and end points of the linestring coincide. 
 The input geometry is a nonempty multilinestring and all its linestrings are closed. 
 The input geometry is a nonempty polygon, all polygon's rings are nonempty, and the start and end points of all its rings coincide. 
 The input geometry is a nonempty multipolygon and all its polygons are closed.
 The input geometry is a nonempty geometry collection and all its components are closed. 
Syntax
ST_IsClosed(geom)
Arguments
geom 
A value of data type GEOMETRY or an expression that evaluates to a GEOMETRY type. 
Return type
BOOLEAN
If geom is null, then null is returned. 
Examples
The following SQL checks if the polygon is closed. 
SELECT ST_IsClosed(ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((0 2,1 1,0 -1,0 2))'));
