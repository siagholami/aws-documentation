Unsupported PostgreSQL data types
Generally, if a query attempts to use an unsupported data type, including explicit or implicit casts, it will return an error. However, some queries that use unsupported data types will run on the leader node but not on the compute nodes. See SQL functions supported on the leader node.
For a list of the supported data types, see Data types.
These PostgreSQL data types are not supported in Amazon Redshift.
