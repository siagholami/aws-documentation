ST_Dimension
ST_Dimension returns the inherent dimension of an input geometry. The inherent dimension is the dimension value of the subtype that is defined in the geometry. 
Syntax
ST_Dimension(geom)
Arguments
geom 
A value of data type GEOMETRY or an expression that evaluates to a GEOMETRY type. 
Return type
INTEGER representing the inherent dimension of geom. 
If geom is null, then null is returned. 
The values returned are as follows.



Returned value
Geometry subtype




0
Returned if geom is a POINT or MULTIPOINT subtype


1
Returned if geom is a LINESTRING or MULTILINESTRING subtype.


2
Returned if geom is a POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON subtype


0
Returned if geom is an empty GEOMETRYCOLLECTION subtype


Largest dimension of the components of the collection
Returned if geom is a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION subtype



Examples
The following SQL converts a well-known text (WKT) representation of a four-point LINESTRING to a GEOMETRY object and returns the dimension of the linestring. 
SELECT ST_Dimension(ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(77.29 29.07,77.42 29.26,77.27 29.31,77.29 29.07)'));
