ST_Covers
ST_Covers returns true if the first input geometry covers the second input geometry. Geometry A covers geometry B if both are nonempty and every point in B is a point in A. 
ST_Covers(A, B) is equivalent to ST_CoveredBy(B, A). 
Syntax
ST_Covers(geom1, geom2)
Arguments
geom1 
A value of data type GEOMETRY or an expression that evaluates to a GEOMETRY type. 
geom2 
A value of data type GEOMETRY or an expression that evaluates to a GEOMETRY type. This value is compared with geom1 to determine if it covers geom1. 
Return type
BOOLEAN
If geom1 or geom2 is null, then null is returned. 
If geom1 and geom2 don't have the same value for the spatial reference system identifier (SRID), then an error is returned. 
If geom1 or geom2 is a geometry collection, then an error is returned. 
Examples
The following SQL checks if the first polygon covers the second polygon. 
SELECT ST_Covers(ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((0 2,1 1,0 -1,0 2))'), ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((-1 3,2 1,0 -3,-1 3))'));
