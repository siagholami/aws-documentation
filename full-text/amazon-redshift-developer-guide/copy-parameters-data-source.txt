Data sources
You can load data from text files in an Amazon S3 bucket, in an Amazon EMR cluster, or on a remote host that your cluster can access using an SSH connection. You can also load data directly from a DynamoDB table. 
The maximum size of a single input row from any source is 4 MB. 
To export data from a table to a set of files in an Amazon S3, use the UNLOAD command.
