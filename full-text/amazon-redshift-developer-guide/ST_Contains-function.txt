ST_Contains
ST_Contains returns true if the first input geometry contains the second input geometry. Geometry A contains geometry B if every point in B is a point in A, and their interiors have nonempty intersection. 
ST_Contains(A, B) is equivalent to ST_Within(B, A). 
Syntax
ST_Contains(geom1, geom2)
Arguments
geom1 
A value of data type GEOMETRY or an expression that evaluates to a GEOMETRY type. 
geom2 
A value of data type GEOMETRY or an expression that evaluates to a GEOMETRY type. This value is compared with geom1 to determine if it is contained within geom1. 
Return type
BOOLEAN
If geom1 or geom2 is null, then null is returned. 
If geom1 and geom2 don't have the same value for the spatial reference system identifier (SRID), then an error is returned. 
If geom1 or geom2 is a geometry collection, then an error is returned. 
Examples
The following SQL checks if the first polygon contains the second polygon. 
SELECT ST_Contains(ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((0 2,1 1,0 -1,0 2))'), ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((-1 3,2 1,0 -3,-1 3))'));
