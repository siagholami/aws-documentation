PG_BACKEND_PID
Returns the process ID (PID) of the server process handling the current session.
Note
The PID is not globally unique. It can be reused over time.
Syntax
pg_backend_pid()
Return type
Returns an integer.
Example
You can correlate PG_BACKEND_PID() with log tables to retrieve information for the current session. For example, the following query returns the query ID and a portion of the query text for queries executed in the current session.
```
select query, substring(text,1,40)
from stl_querytext
where pid =  PG_BACKEND_PID()
order by query desc;
query |                substring
-------------------------------------------------
 14831 | select query, substring(text,1,40) from
 14827 | select query, substring(path,0,80) as pa
 14826 | copy category from 's3://dw-tickit/manif
 14825 | Count rows in target table
 14824 | unload ('select * from category') to 's3
(5 rows)
```
You can correlate PG_BACKEND_PID() with the pid column in the following log tables (exceptions are noted in parentheses):
 STL_CONNECTION_LOG
 STL_DDLTEXT
 STL_ERROR
 STL_QUERY
 STL_QUERYTEXT
 STL_SESSIONS (process)
 STL_TR_CONFLICT
 STL_UTILITYTEXT
 STV_ACTIVE_CURSORS
 STV_INFLIGHT
 STV_LOCKS (lock_owner_pid)
 STV_RECENTS (process_id)
