Insert data rows into a table
After you create a table, you can insert rows of data into that table.
Note
The INSERT command inserts individual rows into a database table. For standard bulk loads, use the COPY command. For more information, see Use a COPY command to load data.
For example, to insert a value of 100 into the testtable table (which contains a single column), issue the following command:
insert into testtable values (100);
