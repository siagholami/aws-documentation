STL_UNLOAD_LOG
Records the details for an unload operation.
STL_UNLOAD_LOG records one row for each file created by an UNLOAD statement. For example, if an UNLOAD creates 12 files, STL_UNLOAD_LOG will contain 12 corresponding rows.
This view is visible to all users. Superusers can see all rows; regular users can see only their own data. For more information, see Visibility of data in system tables and views.

Sample query
To get a list of the files that were written to Amazon S3 by an UNLOAD command, you can call an Amazon S3 list operation after the UNLOAD completes; however, depending on how quickly you issue the call, the list might be incomplete because an Amazon S3 list operation is eventually consistent. To get a complete, authoritative list immediately, query STL_UNLOAD_LOG.
The following query returns the pathname for files that were created by an UNLOAD for the last query executed:
select query, substring(path,0,40) as path
from stl_unload_log
where query = pg_last_query_id() 
order by path;
This command returns the following sample output: 
query |             path
