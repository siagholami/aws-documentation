Regions and endpoints
To view the Regions where Amazon GuardDuty is available, see Amazon GuardDuty endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
We highly recommend that you enable GuardDuty in all supported AWS Regions. This enables GuardDuty to generate findings about unauthorized or unusual activity even in Regions that you are not actively using. This also allows GuardDuty to monitor AWS CloudTrail events for global AWS services such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). If GuardDuty is not enabled in all supported Regions, its ability to detect activity that involves global services is reduced.
If you are using GuardDuty in AWS GovCloud (US), there are differences. For more information, see Amazon GuardDuty in the AWS GovCloud (US) User Guide.
