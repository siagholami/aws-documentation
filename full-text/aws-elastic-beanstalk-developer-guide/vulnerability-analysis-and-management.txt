Configuration and vulnerability analysis in Elastic Beanstalk
AWS and our customers share responsibility for achieving a high level of software component security and compliance. AWS Elastic Beanstalk helps you perform your side of the shared responsibility model by providing a managed updates feature. This feature automatically applies patch and minor updates for an Elastic Beanstalk supported platform version.
For more information, see Shared responsibility model for Elastic Beanstalk platform maintenance.
