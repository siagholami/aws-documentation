To install the EB CLI on macOS


Download and install Python from the downloads page of Python.org. We use version 3.7 to demonstrate.
Note
The EB CLI requires Python 2 version 2.7, or Python 3 version in the range of 3.4 to 3.7.


Install pip with the script that the Python Packaging Authority provides.


$ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
   $ python3 get-pip.py --user

Use pip to install the EB CLI.

$ pip3 install awsebcli --upgrade --user

Add the executable path, ~/Library/Python/3.7/bin, to your PATH variable.

To modify your PATH variable (Linux, Unix, or macOS):


Find your shell's profile script in your user folder. If you are not sure which shell you have, run echo $SHELL.
$ ls -a ~
  .  ..  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  Desktop  Documents  Downloads
   Bash – .bash_profile, .profile, or .bash_login.
   Zsh – .zshrc
   Tcsh – .tcshrc, .cshrc or .login.


Add an export command to your profile script. The following example adds the path represented by LOCAL_PATH to the current PATH variable.
export PATH=LOCAL_PATH:$PATH


Load the profile script described in the first step into your current session. The following example loads the profile script represented by PROFILE_SCRIPT. 
$ source ~/PROFILE_SCRIPT
