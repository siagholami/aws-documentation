Install Python, pip, and the EB CLI on Linux
The EB CLI requires Python 2.7, 3.4, or later. If your distribution didn't come with Python, or came with an earlier version, install Python before installing pip and the EB CLI. 
To install Python 3.7 on Linux

Determine whether Python is already installed.

$ python --version
Note
If your Linux distribution came with Python, you might need to install the Python developer package to get the headers and libraries required to compile extensions and install the EB CLI. Use your package manager to install the developer package (typically named python-dev or python-devel).


If Python 2.7 or later isn't installed, install Python 3.7 using your distribution's package manager. The command and package name vary:
    On Debian derivatives, such as Ubuntu, use APT.
$ sudo apt-get install python3.7
    On Red Hat and derivatives, use yum.
$ sudo yum install python37
    On SUSE and derivatives, use zypper.
$ sudo zypper install python3-3.7


To verify that Python installed correctly, open a terminal or shell and run the following command.


$ python3 --version
   Python 3.7.3
Install pip by using the script provided by the Python Packaging Authority, and then install the EB CLI.
To install pip and the EB CLI

Download the installation script from pypa.io.

$ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
The script downloads and installs the latest version of pip and another required package named setuptools. 

Run the script with Python.

$ python3 get-pip.py --user

Invoking Python version 3 directly by using the python3 command instead of python ensures that pip is installed in the proper location, even if an earlier version of Python is present on your system.

Add the executable path, ~/.local/bin, to your PATH variable.

To modify your PATH variable (Linux, Unix, or macOS):


Find your shell's profile script in your user folder. If you are not sure which shell you have, run echo $SHELL.
$ ls -a ~
  .  ..  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  Desktop  Documents  Downloads
   Bash – .bash_profile, .profile, or .bash_login.
   Zsh – .zshrc
   Tcsh – .tcshrc, .cshrc or .login.


Add an export command to your profile script. The following example adds the path represented by LOCAL_PATH to the current PATH variable.
export PATH=LOCAL_PATH:$PATH


Load the profile script described in the first step into your current session. The following example loads the profile script represented by PROFILE_SCRIPT. 
$ source ~/PROFILE_SCRIPT


Verify that pip is installed correctly.


$ pip --version
   pip 8.1.2 from ~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (python 3.7)

Use pip to install the EB CLI.

$ pip install awsebcli --upgrade --user

Verify that the EB CLI installed correctly.

$ eb --version
   EB CLI 3.14.8 (Python 3.7)
To upgrade to the latest version, run the installation command again.
$ pip install awsebcli --upgrade --user
