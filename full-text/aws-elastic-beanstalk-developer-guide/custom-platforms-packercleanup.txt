Packer instance cleanup
In certain circumstances, such as stopping the Packer builder process before it is finished, instances launched by Packer are not cleaned up. These instances are not part of the Elastic Beanstalk environment and can be viewed and terminated only by using the Amazon EC2 service.
To manually clean up these instances


Open the Amazon EC2 console.


Make sure you are in the same AWS Region in which you created the instance with Packer.


Under Resources*, choose *N Running Instances, where N indicates the number of running instances.


Click in the query text box.


Select the Name tag.


Enter packer.


The query should look like: tag:Name: packer


Select any instances that match the query.


If the Instance State is running, choose Actions, Instance State, Stop, and then Actions, Instance State, Terminate.
