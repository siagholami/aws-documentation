Example: Using custom amazon CloudWatch metrics
Amazon CloudWatch is a web service that enables you to monitor, manage, and publish various metrics, as well as configure alarm actions based on data from metrics. You can define custom metrics for your own use, and Elastic Beanstalk will push those metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. Once Amazon CloudWatch contains your custom metrics, you can view those in the Amazon CloudWatch console.
The Amazon CloudWatch Monitoring Scripts for Linux are available to demonstrate how to produce and consume Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics. The scripts comprise a fully functional example that reports memory, swap, and disk space utilization metrics for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Linux instance. For more information about the Amazon CloudWatch Monitoring Scripts, go to Amazon CloudWatch Monitoring Scripts for Linux in the Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide.
Note
Elastic Beanstalk Enhanced Health Reporting has native support for publishing a wide range of instance and environment metrics to CloudWatch. See Publishing Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics for an environment for details.

.Ebextensions configuration file
This example uses commands and option settings in an .ebextensions configuration file to download, install, and run monitoring scripts provided by Amazon CloudWatch.
To use this sample, save it to a file named cloudwatch.config in a directory named .ebextensions at the top level of your project directory, then deploy your application using the Elastic Beanstalk console (include the .ebextensions directory in your source bundle) or the EB CLI.
For more information about configuration files, see Advanced environment customization with configuration files (.ebextensions).
.ebextensions/cloudwatch.config
```

    CloudWatchMetrics : "--mem-util --mem-used --mem-avail --disk-space-util --disk-space-used --disk-space-avail --disk-path=/ --auto-scaling"
```
After you verify the configuration file works, you can conserve disk usage by changing the command redirect from a log file (>> /var/log/cwpump.log 2>&1) to /dev/null (> /dev/null). 
Permissions
In order to publish custom Amazon CloudWatch metrics, the instances in your environment need permission to use CloudWatch. You can grant permissions to your environment's instances by adding them to the environment's instance profile. You can add permissions to the instance profile before or after deploying your application.
To grant permissions to publish CloudWatch metrics


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles.


Choose your environment's instance profile role. By default, when you create an environment with the Elastic Beanstalk console or EB CLI, this is aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role.


Choose the Permissions tab.


Under Inline Policies, in the Permissions section, choose Create Role Policy.


Choose Custom Policy, and then choose Select.


Complete the following fields, and then choose Apply Policy:
Policy Name
The name of the policy.
Policy Document
Copy and paste the following text into the policy document:  


{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Action": [
           "cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
           "ec2:DescribeTags"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": [
           "*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
For more information about managing policies, see Working with Policies in the IAM User Guide.
Viewing metrics in the CloudWatch console
After deploying the CloudWatch configuration file to your environment, check the Amazon CloudWatch console to view your metrics. Custom metrics will have the prefix Linux System.
