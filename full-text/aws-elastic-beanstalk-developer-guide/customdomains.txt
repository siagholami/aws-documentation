Your Elastic Beanstalk environment's Domain name
By default, your environment is available to users at a subdomain of elasticbeanstalk.com. When you create an environment, you can choose a hostname for your application. The subdomain and domain are autopopulated to region.elasticbeanstalk.com.
To route users to your environment, Elastic Beanstalk registers a CNAME record that points to your environment's load balancer. You can see URL of your environment's application with the current value of the CNAME in the environment overview page of the Elastic Beanstalk console.

Choose the URL on the overview page, or choose Go to environment on the navigation pane, to navigate to your application's web page.
You can change the CNAME on your environment by swapping it with the CNAME of another environment. For instructions, see Blue/Green deployments with Elastic Beanstalk.
If you own a domain name, you can use Amazon Route 53 to resolve it to your environment. You can purchase a domain name with Amazon Route 53, or use one that you purchase from another provider. 
To purchase a domain name with Route 53, see Registering a New Domain in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
To learn more about using a custom domain, see Routing Traffic to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk Environment in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
Important
If you terminate an environment, you must also delete any CNAME mappings you created, as other customers can reuse an available hostname.
