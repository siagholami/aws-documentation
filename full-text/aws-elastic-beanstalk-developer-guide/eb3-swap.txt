eb swap
Description
Swaps the environment's CNAME with the CNAME of another environment (for example, to avoid downtime when you update your application version).
Note
If you have more than two environments, you are prompted to select the name of the environment that is currently using your desired CNAME from a list of environments. To suppress this, you can specify the name of the environment to use by including the -n option when you run the command.
Syntax
eb swap 
eb swap environment-name 
Note
The environment-name is the environment for which you want a different CNAME. If you don't specify environment-name as a command line parameter when you run eb swap, EB CLI updates the CNAME of the default environment.
Options

Common options
