Manually install the EB CLI

To install the EB CLI, we recommend using the EB CLI setup scripts. If the setup scripts aren't compatible with your development environment, manually install the EB CLI.
The primary distribution method for the EB CLI on Linux, macOS, and Windows is pip. This is a package manager for Python that provides an easy way to install, upgrade, and remove Python packages and their dependencies. For macOS, you can also get the latest version of the EB CLI with Homebrew.
Compatibility notes
The EB CLI is developed in Python and requires Python version 2.7, 3.4, or later. 
Note
Amazon Linux, starting with version 2015.03, comes with Python 2.7 and pip.
We recommend using the EB CLI setup scripts to install the EB CLI and its dependencies. If you manually install the EB CLI, it can be difficult to manage dependency conflicts in your development environment.
The EB CLI and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) share a dependency on the botocore Python package. Due to a breaking change in botocore, different versions of these two CLI tools depend on different versions of botocore.
The latest versions of the two CLIs are compatible. If you need to use an earlier version, see the following table for a compatible version to use.



EB CLI version
Compatible AWS CLI version




3.14.5 or earlier
1.16.9 or earlier


3.14.6 or later
1.16.11 or later



Install the EB CLI
If you already have pip and a supported version of Python, use the following procedure to install the EB CLI.
If you don't have Python and pip, use the procedure for the operating system you're using. 
 Install Python, pip, and the EB CLI on Linux 
 Install the EB CLI on macOS
 Install Python, pip, and the EB CLI on Windows
To install the EB CLI

Run the following command.

$ pip install awsebcli --upgrade --user
The --upgrade option tells pip to upgrade any requirements that are already installed. The --user option tells pip to install the program to a subdirectory of your user directory to avoid modifying libraries that your operating system uses.
Note
If you encounter issues when you try to install the EB CLI with pip, you can install the EB CLI in a virtual environment to isolate the tool and its dependencies, or use a different version of Python than you normally do.


Add the path to the executable file to your PATH variable:
    On Linux and macOS:
Linux – ~/.local/bin
macOS – ~/Library/Python/3.7/bin
To modify your PATH variable (Linux, Unix, or macOS ):


Find your shell's profile script in your user folder. If you are not sure which shell you have, run echo $SHELL.
$ ls -a ~
.  ..  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  Desktop  Documents  Downloads
 Bash – .bash_profile, .profile, or .bash_login.
 Zsh – .zshrc
 Tcsh – .tcshrc, .cshrc or .login.


Add an export command to your profile script. The following example adds the path represented by LOCAL_PATH to the current PATH variable.
export PATH=LOCAL_PATH:$PATH


Load the profile script described in the first step into your current session. The following example loads the profile script represented by PROFILE_SCRIPT. 
$ source ~/PROFILE_SCRIPT
    On Windows:


Python 3.7 – %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\Scripts
Python earlier versions – %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts
To modify your PATH variable (Windows):


Press the Windows key, and then enter environment variables.


Choose Edit environment variables for your account.


Choose PATH, and then choose Edit.


Add paths to the Variable value field, separated by semicolons. For example: C:\item1\path;C:\item2\path


Choose OK twice to apply the new settings.


Close any running Command Prompt windows, and then reopen a Command Prompt window.
