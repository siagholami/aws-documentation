Record transformation
To create a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that doesn't transform incoming data, choose Disabled. 
To specify a Lambda function for Kinesis Data Firehose to invoke and use to transform incoming data before delivering it, choose Enabled. You can configure a new Lambda function using one of the Lambda blueprints or choose an existing Lambda function. Your Lambda function must contain the status model that is required by Kinesis Data Firehose. For more information, see Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Data Transformation.


In the Convert record format section, provide values for the following field:
Record format conversion
To create a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that doesn't convert the format of the incoming data records, choose Disabled. 
To convert the format of the incoming records, choose Enabled, then specify the output format you want. You need to specify an AWS Glue table that holds the schema that you want Kinesis Data Firehose to use to convert your record format. For more information, see Converting Your Input Record Format in Kinesis Data Firehose.
For an example of how to set up record format conversion with AWS CloudFormation, see AWS::KinesisFirehose::DeliveryStream.
