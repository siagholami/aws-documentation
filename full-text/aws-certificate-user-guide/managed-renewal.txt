Managed Renewal for ACM's Amazon-Issued Certificates
ACM provides managed renewal for your Amazon-issued SSL/TLS certificates. This includes both public and private certificates issued by using ACM. If possible, ACM renews your certificates automatically with no action required from you. A certificate is eligible for automatic renewal subject to the following considerations:
 ELIGIBLE if associated with another AWS service, such as Elastic Load Balancing or CloudFront.
 ELIGIBLE if exported since being issued or last renewed.
 ELIGIBLE if it is a private certificate issued by calling the ACM https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/APIReference/API_RequestCertificate.html API.
 ELIGIBLE if it is a private certificate issued through the management console.
 NOT ELIGIBLE if it is a private certificate issued by calling the ACM Private CA https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_IssueCertificate.html API.
 NOT ELIGIBLE if imported.
When ACM renews a certificate, the certificate's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) remains the same. Also, ACM certificates are regional resources. If you have certificates for the same domain name in multiple AWS Regions, ACM renews each of these certificates independently.
Important
Your ACM certificate must be actively associated with a supported AWS service before it can be automatically renewed. For information about the resources that ACM supports, see Services Integrated with AWS Certificate Manager. 
For more information about managed certificate renewal, see the following topics. If you encounter renewal problems, see Troubleshooting Managed Certificate Renewal.
Note
If you encounter error messages when creating or renewing ACM Private CA certificates through ACM, consult the Troubleshooting section Private Certificate Exception Handling.
