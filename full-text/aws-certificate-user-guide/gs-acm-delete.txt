Deleting Certificates Managed by ACM
You can use the ACM console or the AWS CLI to delete a certificate.
Important
Deleting a certificate issued by a private certificate authority (CA) has no effect on the CA. You will continue to be charged for the CA until it is deleted. For more information, see Deleting Your Private CA in the AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority User Guide.
Delete Certificates (Console)
In the list of certificates, select the check box for the ACM certificate that you want to delete. For Actions, choose Delete. 
Note
You cannot delete an ACM certificate that is being used by another AWS service. To delete a certificate that is in use, you must first remove the certificate association. 
Delete Certificates (CLI)
You can use the delete-certificate command list the metadata for a certificate. 
aws acm delete-certificate --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
