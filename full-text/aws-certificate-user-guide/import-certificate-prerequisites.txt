Prerequisites for Importing Certificates
To import a self–signed SSL/TLS certificate into ACM, you must provide the certificate and its private key. To import a signed certificate, you must also include the certificate chain. Your certificate must satisfy the following criteria:
 The certificate must specify a cryptographic algorithm and a key size. The following algorithms are supported by ACM: 
   1024-bit RSA (RSA_1024)
   2048-bit RSA (RSA_2048)
   4096-bit RSA (RSA_4096)
   Elliptic Prime Curve 256 bit (EC_prime256v1)
   Elliptic Prime Curve 384 bit (EC_secp384r1)
   Elliptic Prime Curve 521 bit (EC_secp521r1)
Important
Note that integrated services only allow algorithms and key sizes they support to be associated with their resources. For example, public key length must be 1024 or 2048 bits for integration with CloudFront. For more information, see the documentation for each service.
For Elastic Load Balancing, see HTTPS Listeners for Your Application Load Balancer and Using an SSL/TLS Certificate with a Load Balancer.
For CloudFront, see Supported SSL/TLS Protocols and Ciphers and Public Key Size Requirements.
 The certificate must be an SSL/TLS X.509 version 3 certificate. It must contain a public key, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address for your website, and information about the issuer. The certificate can be self-signed by your private key or by the private key of an issuing CA. If your certificate is signed by a CA, you must include the certificate chain when you import your certificate. 
 The certificate must be valid at the time of import. You cannot import a certificate before its validity period begins or after it expires. The NotBefore certificate field contains the validity start date, and the NotAfter field contains the end date.
 The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or passphrase.
 The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM–encoded. For more information and examples, see Certificate and Key Format for Importing.
 The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the algorithm of the signing CA. For example, if the signing CA key type is RSA, then the certificate key type must also be RSA.
