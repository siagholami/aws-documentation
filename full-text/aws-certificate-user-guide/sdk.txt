Using the ACM API
You can use the AWS Certificate Manager API to interact with the service programmatically by sending HTTP requests. For more information, see the AWS Certificate Manager API Reference.
In addition to the web API (or HTTP API), you can use the AWS SDKs and command line tools to interact with ACM and other services. For more information, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.
The following topics show you how to use one of the AWS SDKs, the AWS SDK for Java, to perform some of the available operations in the AWS Certificate Manager API.
