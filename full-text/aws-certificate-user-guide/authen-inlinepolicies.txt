Inline Policies
Inline policies are policies that you create and manage and embed directly into a single user, group, or role. The following policy examples show how to assign permissions to perform ACM actions. For more information about attaching inline policies, see Working with Inline Policies in the IAM User Guide. You can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the IAM API to create and embed inline policies.
