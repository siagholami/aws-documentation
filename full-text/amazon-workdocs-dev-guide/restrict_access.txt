Restricting access to a specific Amazon WorkDocs instance
If you have multiple Amazon WorkDocs sites on an AWS account and you want to grant API access to a specific site, you can do so by defining a condition element. The Condition element lets you specify conditions for when a policy is in effect.
The following is an example of a condition element:
"Condition": 
    {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "Resource.OrganizationId": "d-123456789c5"
                }
    }
With the above condition in place in a policy, users are allowed to access only the Amazon WorkDocs instance with Id d-123456789c5. Amazon WorkDocs Instance Id is sometimes referred as Organization Id or Directory Id.
An Organization ID is also referred to as a Directory ID or an Instance ID. It can be used to restrict access to one or more Amazon WorkDocs sites on an account. For more information, see Restricting access to a specific Amazon WorkDocs instance.
You can get a Amazon WorkDocs organization ID from the AWS console using the following steps:
To get an organization ID


In the AWS Directory Service console navigation pane, select Directories.


The Directory ID corresponding to your Amazon WorkDocs site is the Organization ID for that site.
