Creating a new user
The following code snippet demonstrates the request construction for creating a new user in Amazon WorkDocs.
Note
This is not a valid operation for a Connected AD configuration. To add a new user in the Connected AD configuration, the user must already be present in the enterprise directory. Then, you must make a call to the ActivateUser API to activate the user in Amazon WorkDocs.
The following example demonstrates how to create a new user with a storage quota of 1 gigabytes.
CreateUserRequest request = new CreateUserRequest();
    request.setGivenName("GivenName");
    request.setOrganizationId("d-12345678c4");
    // Passwords should:
    //   Be between 8 and 64 characters
    //   Contain three of the four below:
    //   A Lowercase Character
    //   An Uppercase Character
    //   A Number
    //   A Special Character
    request.setPassword("Badpa$$w0rd");
    request.setSurname("surname");
    request.setUsername("UserName");
    StorageRuleType storageRule = new StorageRuleType();
    storageRule.setStorageType(StorageType.QUOTA);
    storageRule.setStorageAllocatedInBytes(new Long(1048576l));
    request.setStorageRule(storageRule);
    CreateUserResult result = workDocsClient.createUser(request);
