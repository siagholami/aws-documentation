Managing notifications for an IAM user or a role
IAM administrators can enable or disable notifications in Amazon WorkDocs through the IAM console.
Note
Even if there is an explicit allow policy attached to a user or role that grants access to Notification APIs, administrators must use the IAM console to enable notifications for the specified user or role ARN. Unless notifications are explicitly enabled for the user or role ARN, the applications using the user or role credentials are not able to make calls to CreateNotificationSubscription to subscribe and receive notifications.
