Tutorial: Run a Query That Produces a Time Series Visualization
When you run a query that uses the bin() function to group the returned results by a time period, you can view the results as a line graph, stacked area graph, pie chart, or bar chart. This helps you more efficiently visualize trends in log events over time.
To run a query for visualization


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Insights.


Select one or more log groups to query.


In the query editor, delete the current contents, enter the following stats function, and then choose Run query.


stats count(*) by bin(30s)
The results show the number of log events in the log group that were received by CloudWatch Logs for each 30-second period.

Choose the Visualization tab.

The results are shown as a line graph. To switch to a bar chart, pie chart, or stacked area chart, choose the arrow next to Line at the upper left of the graph.
