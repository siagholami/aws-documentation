Modifying Destination Membership at Runtime
You might encounter situations where you have to add or remove membership of some users from a destination that you own. You can use the PutDestinationPolicy action on your destination with new access policy. In the following example, a previously added account 111111111111 is stopped from sending any more log data, and account 222222222222 is enabled.

Fetch the policy that is currently associated with the destination testDestination and make a note of the AccessPolicy:

```
   aws logs describe-destinations \
       --destination-name-prefix "testDestination"
{
    "Destinations": [
      {
        "DestinationName": "testDestination",
        "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/CWLtoKinesisRole",
        "DestinationArn": "arn:aws:logs:region:222222222222:destination:testDestination",
        "TargetArn": "arn:aws:kinesis:region:222222222222:stream/RecipientStream",
        "AccessPolicy": "{\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [{\"Sid\": \"\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": {\"AWS\": \"111111111111\"}, \"Action\": \"logs:PutSubscriptionFilter\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:logs:region:123456789012:destination:testDestination\"}] }"
      }
    ]
   }
   ```

Update the policy to reflect that account 111111111111 is stopped, and that account 222222222222 is enabled. Put this policy in the \~/NewAccessPolicy.json file:

{
     "Version" : "2012-10-17",
     "Statement" : [
       {
         "Sid" : "",
         "Effect" : "Allow",
         "Principal" : {
           "AWS" : "222222222222"
         },
         "Action" : "logs:PutSubscriptionFilter",
         "Resource" : "arn:aws:logs:region:222222222222:destination:testDestination"
       }
     ]
   }

Call PutDestinationPolicy to associate the policy defined in the NewAccessPolicy.json file with the destination:

aws logs put-destination-policy \
   --destination-name "testDestination" \
   --access-policy file://~/NewAccessPolicy.json
This will eventually disable the log events from account ID 111111111111. Log events from account ID 222222222222 start flowing to the destination as soon as the owner of account 222222222222 creates a subscription filter using PutSubscriptionFilter.
