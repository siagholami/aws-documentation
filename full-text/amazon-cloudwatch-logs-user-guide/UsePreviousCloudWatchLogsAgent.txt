Use the Previous CloudWatch Logs Agent to Get Started With CloudWatch Logs
Using the CloudWatch Logs agent, you can publish log data from Amazon EC2 instances running Linux or Windows Server, and logged events from AWS CloudTrail. We recommend instead using the CloudWatch unified agent to publish your log data. For more information about the new agent, see Collect Metrics and Logs from Amazon EC2 Instances and On-Premises Servers with the CloudWatch Agent in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. Alternatively, you can continue using the previous CloudWatch Logs agent.
