Using CloudWatch Logs with Interface VPC Endpoints
If you use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to host your AWS resources, you can establish a private connection between your VPC and CloudWatch Logs. You can use this connection to send logs to CloudWatch Logs without sending them through the internet.
Amazon VPC is an AWS service that you can use to launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. With a VPC, you have control over your network settings, such the IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways. To connect your VPC to CloudWatch Logs, you define an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs. This type of endpoint enables you to connect your VPC to AWS services. The endpoint provides reliable, scalable connectivity to CloudWatch Logs without requiring an internet gateway, network address translation (NAT) instance, or VPN connection. For more information, see What is Amazon VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, an AWS technology that enables private communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IP addresses. For more information, see New – AWS PrivateLink for AWS Services.
The following steps are for users of Amazon VPC. For more information, see Getting Started in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

Creating a VPC Endpoint for CloudWatch Logs
To start using CloudWatch Logs with your VPC, create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs. The service to choose is com.amazonaws.Region.logs. For more information, see Creating an Interface Endpoint in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
You do not need to change the settings for CloudWatch Logs. CloudWatch Logs calls other AWS services using either public endpoints or private interface VPC endpoints, whichever are in use. For example, if you create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs, and you already have a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter for Kinesis Data Streams and an interface VPC endpoint for Kinesis Data Streams, calls between CloudWatch Logs and Kinesis Data Streams begin to flow through the interface VPC endpoint.
Testing the Connection Between Your VPC and CloudWatch Logs
After you create the endpoint, you can test the connection.
To test the connection between your VPC and your CloudWatch Logs endpoint


Connect to an Amazon EC2 instance that resides in your VPC. For information about connecting, see Connect to Your Linux Instance or Connecting to Your Windows Instance in the Amazon EC2 documentation.


From the instance, use the AWS CLI to create a log entry in one of your existing log groups.


First, create a JSON file with a log event. The timestamp must be specified as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
[
     {
       "timestamp": 1533854071310,
       "message": "VPC Connection Test"
     }
   ]
Then, use the put-log-events command to create the log entry:
aws logs put-log-events --log-group-name LogGroupName --log-stream-name LogStreamName --log-events file://JSONFileName
If the response to the command includes nextSequenceToken, the command has succeeded and your VPC endpoint is working.
Controlling Access to Your CloudWatch Logs VPC Endpoint
A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint when you create or modify the endpoint. If you don't attach a policy when you create an endpoint, we attach a default policy for you that allows full access to the service. An endpoint policy doesn't override or replace IAM user policies or service-specific policies. It's a separate policy for controlling access from the endpoint to the specified service. 
Endpoint policies must be written in JSON format. 
For more information, see Controlling Access to Services with VPC Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
The following is an example of an endpoint policy for CloudWatch Logs. This policy enables users connecting to CloudWatch Logs through the VPC to create log streams and send logs to CloudWatch Logs, and prevents them from performing other CloudWatch Logs actions.
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PutOnly",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
To modify the VPC endpoint policy for CloudWatch Logs


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Endpoints.


If you have not already created the endpoint for CloudWatch Logs, choose Create Endpoint. Then select com.amazonaws.Region.logs and choose Create endpoint.


Select the com.amazonaws.Region.logs endpoint, and choose the Policy tab in the lower half of the screen.


Choose Edit Policy and make the changes to the policy.


Support for VPC Context Keys
CloudWatch Logs supports the aws:SourceVpc and aws:SourceVpce context keys that can limit access to specific VPCs or specific VPC endpoints. These keys work only when the user is using VPC endpoints. For more information, see Keys Available for Some Services in the IAM User Guide.
