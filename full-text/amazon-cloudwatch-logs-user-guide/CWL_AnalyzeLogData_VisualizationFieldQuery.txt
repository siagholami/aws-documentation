Tutorial: Run a Query That Produces a Visualization Grouped by Log Fields
When you run a query that uses the stats function to group the returned results by the values of one or more fields in the log entries, you can view the results as a bar chart, pie chart, line graph or stacked area graph. This helps you more efficiently visualize trends in your logs.
To run a query for visualization


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Insights.


Select one or more log groups to query.


In the query editor, delete the current contents, enter the following stats function, and then choose Run query.


stats count(*) by @logStream 
       | limit 100
The results show the number of log events in the log group for each log stream. The results are limited to only 100 rows.


Choose the Visualization tab.


Select the arrow next to Line, and then choose Bar.


The bar chart appears, showing a bar for each log stream in the log group.
