Add Query to Dashboard or Export Query Results
After you run a query, you can add the query to a CloudWatch dashboard or copy the results to the clipboard.
Queries added to dashboards run every time you load the dashboard and every time that the dashboard refreshes. These queries count toward your limit of four concurrent CloudWatch Logs Insights queries.
