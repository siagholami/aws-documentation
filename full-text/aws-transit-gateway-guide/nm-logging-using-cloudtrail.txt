Logging Transit Gateway Network Manager API calls with AWS CloudTrail
Transit Gateway Network Manager (Network Manager) works together with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Network Manager. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Network Manager as events. The calls that are captured include calls from the Network Manager console and code calls to the Network Manager API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Network Manager. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Network Manager, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details. 
To learn more about CloudTrail, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
Network Manager information in CloudTrail
CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When activity occurs in Network Manager, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in Event history. You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account. For more information, see Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History. 
For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for Network Manager, create a trail. A trail enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all AWS Regions. The trail logs events from all Regions in the AWS partition, and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see the following:

 Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Regions and Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Accounts
All Network Manager actions are logged by CloudTrail and are documented in the Network Manager API Reference. For example, calls to the  CreateGlobalNetwork action generate entries in the CloudTrail log files. 
Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request. The identity information helps you determine the following: 
 Whether the request was made with root or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user credentials
 Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a role or federated user
 Whether the request was made by another AWS service
