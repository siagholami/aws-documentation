Getting started with Transit Gateway Network Manager
The following tasks help you become familiar with Transit Gateway Network Manager (Network Manager).
In this example, you create a global network and register your transit gateway with the global network. You can also define and associate your on-premises network resources with the global network.
Topics
 Prerequisites
 Step 1: Create a global network
 Step 2: Register your transit gateway
 Step 3: (Optional) Define and associate your on-premises network resources
 Step 4: View and monitor your global network
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have a transit gateway with attachments in your account. For more information, see Getting Started with Transit Gateways.
The transit gateway must be in the same AWS account as the global network.
Step 1: Create a global network
Create a global network as a container for your transit gateway.
To create a global network


Open the Network Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/. 


In the navigation pane, choose Global networks.


Choose Create global network.


Enter a name and description for the global network, and choose Create global network.


Step 2: Register your transit gateway
Register your transit gateway in your global network.
To register the transit gateway


Open the Network Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/. 


In the navigation pane, choose Global networks.


Choose the ID of your global network.


In the navigation pane, choose Transit gateways. Choose Register transit gateway.


Select the transit gateway in the list, and choose Register transit gateway.


Step 3: (Optional) Define and associate your on-premises network resources
You can define your on-premises network by creating sites, links, and devices to represent objects in your network. For more information, see the following procedures:
 Creating a site
 Creating a link
 Creating a device
You associate the device with a specific site, and with one or more links. For more information, see Device associations.
Finally, create a Site-to-Site VPN connection attachment on your transit gateway, and associate the customer gateway with the device. For more information, see Customer gateway associations.
You can also work with one of our Partners in the AWS Partner Network (APN) to provision and connect your on-premises network. For more information, see Transit Gateway Network Manager.
Step 4: View and monitor your global network
The Network Manager console provides a dashboard for you to view and monitor the network objects in your global network.
To access the dashboard for your global network


Open the Network Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/. 


In the navigation pane, choose Global networks.


Choose the ID of your global network.


The Overview page provides an inventory of the objects in your global network. For more information about the pages in the dashboard, see Visualizing and monitoring your global network using the Network Manager console.
