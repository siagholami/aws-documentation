Create the service-linked role
You don't need to manually create the AWSServiceRoleForNetworkManager role. Network Manager creates this role for you when you create your first global network.
For Network Manager to create a service-linked role on your behalf, you must have the required permissions. For more information, see Service-Linked Role Permissions in the IAM User Guide.
Edit the service-linked role
You can edit the description of AWSServiceRoleForNetworkManager using IAM. For more information, see Editing a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
Delete the service-linked role
If you no longer need to use Network Manager, we recommend that you delete the AWSServiceRoleForNetworkManager role.
You can delete this service-linked role only after you delete your global network.
You can use the IAM console, the IAM CLI, or the IAM API to delete service-linked roles. For more information, see Deleting a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
After you delete AWSServiceRoleForNetworkManager, Network Manager will create the role again when you create a new global network.
