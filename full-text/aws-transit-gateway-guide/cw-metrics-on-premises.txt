CloudWatch metrics for on-premises resources
Network Manager publishes data points to Amazon CloudWatch for your on-premises resources, including devices and links. CloudWatch enables you to retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time series data, known as metrics. Each data point has an associated timestamp and an optional unit of measurement. 
You can use metrics to verify that your system is performing as expected. For example, you can create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor a specified metric and initiate an action (such as sending a notification to an email address) if the metric goes outside what you consider an acceptable range.
