Tagging your Network Manager resources
A tag is a metadata label that either you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value. For tags that you assign, you define the key and the value. For example, you might define the key as purpose and the value as test for one resource.
Tags help you do the following:
 Identify and organize your AWS resources. Many AWS services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related.
 Control access to your AWS resources. For more information, see Controlling Access Using Tags in the IAM User Guide.
