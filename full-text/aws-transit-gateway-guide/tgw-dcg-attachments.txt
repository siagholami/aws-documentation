Attach a transit gateway to a Direct Connect gateway using a transit virtual interface. This configuration offers the following benefits. You can:
 Manage a single connection for multiple VPCs or VPNs that are in the same Region.
 Advertise prefixes from on-premises to AWS and from AWS to on-premises.
The following diagram illustrates how the Direct Connect gateway enables you to create a single connection to your Direct Connect connection that all of your VPCs can use.

The solution involves the following components:
 A transit gateway.
 A Direct Connect gateway.
 An association between the Direct Connect gateway and the transit gateway.
 A transit virtual interface that is attached to the Direct Connect gateway.
