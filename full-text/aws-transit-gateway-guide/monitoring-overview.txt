Using Amazon CloudWatch metrics and events with your global network
AWS provides the following monitoring tools to watch the resources in your global network, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when appropriate.
 Amazon CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources and the applications that you run on AWS in real time. You can collect and track metrics, create customized dashboards, and set alarms that notify you or take actions when a specified metric reaches a threshold that you specify. For more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
 Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near-real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. CloudWatch Events enables automated event-driven computing, as you can write rules that watch for certain events and trigger automated actions in other AWS services when these events happen. For more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide.
