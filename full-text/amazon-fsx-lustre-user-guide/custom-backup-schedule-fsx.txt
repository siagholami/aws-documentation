Setting Up a Custom Backup Schedule
Amazon FSx for Lustre automatically can take a backup of your file system once a day during a daily backup window. Amazon FSx enforces a retention period that you specify for these automatic backups. It also supports user-initiated backups, so you can make backups at any point.
Following, you can find the resources and configuration to deploy custom backup scheduling. Custom backup scheduling performs user-initiated backups on an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system on a custom schedule that you define. Examples might be once every six hours, once every week, and so on. This script also configures deleting backups older than your specified retention period.
The solution automatically deploys all the components needed, and takes in the following parameters:
 The file system
 A CRON schedule pattern for performing backups
 The backup retention period (in days)
 The backup name tags
For more information on CRON schedule patterns, see Schedule Expressions for Rules in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Architecture Overview
Deploying this solution builds the following resources in the AWS Cloud.

This solution does the following:


The AWS CloudFormation template deploys an CloudWatch Event, a Lambda function, an Amazon SNS queue, and an IAM role. The IAM role gives the Lambda function permission to invoke the Amazon FSx for Lustre API operations.


The CloudWatch event runs on a schedule you define as a CRON pattern, during the initial deployment. This event invokes the solutionâ€™s backup manager Lambda function that invokes the Amazon FSx for Lustre CreateBackup API operation to initiate a backup.


The backup manager retrieves a list of existing user-initiated backups for the specified file system using DescribeBackup. It then deletes backups older than the retention period, which you specify during the initial deployment.


The backup manager sends a notification message to the Amazon SNS queue on a successful backup if you choose the option to be notified during the initial deployment. A notification is always sent in the event of a failure.


AWS CloudFormation Template
This solution uses AWS CloudFormation to automate the deployment of the Amazon FSx for Lustre custom backup scheduling solution. To use this solution, download the fsx-scheduled-backup.template AWS CloudFormation template.
Automated Deployment
The following procedure configures and deploys this custom backup scheduling solution. It takes about five minutes to deploy. Before you start, you must have the ID of an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system running in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) in your AWS account. For more information on creating these resources, see Getting Started with Amazon FSx for Lustre.
Note
Implementing this solution incurs billing for the associated AWS services. For more information, see the pricing details pages for those services.
To launch the custom backup solution stack


Download the fsx-scheduled-backup.template AWS CloudFormation template. For more information on creating an AWS CloudFormation stack, see Creating a Stack on the AWS CloudFormation Console in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
Note
By default, this template launches in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region. Amazon FSx for Lustre is currently only available in specific AWS Regions. You must launch this solution in an AWS Region where Amazon FSx for Lustre is available. For more information, see the Amazon FSx section of AWS Regions and Endpoints in the *AWS General Reference. *


For Parameters, review the parameters for the template and modify them for the needs of your file system. This solution uses the following default values.  



[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Choose Next.


For Options, choose Next.


For Review, review and confirm the settings. You must select the check box acknowledging that the template create IAM resources.


Choose Create to deploy the stack.


You can view the status of the stack in the AWS CloudFormation console in the Status column. You should see a status of CREATE_COMPLETE in about five minutes.
Additional Options
You can use the Lambda function created by this solution to perform custom scheduled backups of more than one Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. The file system ID is passed to the Amazon FSx for Lustre function in the input JSON for the CloudWatch event. The default JSON passed to the Lambda function is as follows, where the values for FilesystemId and SuccessNotification are passed from the parameters specified when launching the AWS CloudFormation stack.
{
    "start-backup": "true",
    "purge-backups": "true",
    "filesystem-id": "${FilesystemId}",
    "notify_on_success": "${SuccessNotification}"
}
To schedule backups for an additional Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, create another CloudWatch event rule. You do so using the Schedule event source, with the Lambda function created by this solution as the target. Choose Constant (JSON text) under Configure Input. For the JSON input, simply substitute the file system ID of the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system to back up in place of ${FilesystemId}. Also, substitute either Yes or No in place of ${SuccessNotification} in the JSON above.
Any additional CloudWatch Event rules you create manually aren't part of the Amazon FSx for Lustre custom scheduled backup solution AWS CloudFormation stack. Thus, they aren't removed if you delete the stack.
