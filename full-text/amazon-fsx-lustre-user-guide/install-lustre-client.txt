Installing the Lustre Client
To mount your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system from a Linux instance, first install the open-source Lustre client. Amazon FSx supports access from the 2.10 versions of the Lustre client. Then, depending on your operating system version, use one of the following procedures. If your compute instance isn't running the Linux kernel specified in the installation instructions, and you can't change the kernel, you can build your own Lustre client. For more information, see Compiling Lustre on the Lustre wiki.
To Install the Lustre Client as an RPM Package (Amazon Linux 2)


Open a terminal on your client.


Determine which kernel is currently running on your compute instance by running the following command.


uname -r


Do one of the following:
    If the command returns 4.14.104-95.84.amzn2.x86_64 for x86-based EC2 instances, or 4.14.181-142.260.amzn2.aarch64 or higher for Graviton2-based EC2 instances, download and install the Lustre client with the following command.
sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lustre2.10
     If the command returns a result less than 4.14.104-95.84.amzn2.x86_64 for x86-based EC2 instances, or less than 4.14.181-142.260.amzn2.aarch64 for Graviton2-based EC2 instances, update the kernel and reboot your Amazon EC2 instance by running the following command. 
sudo yum -y update kernel && sudo reboot
Confirm that the kernel has been updated using the uname -r command. Then download and install the Lustre client as described above.


To Install the Lustre Client as an RPM Package (Amazon Linux)


Open a terminal on your client.


Determine which kernel is currently running on your compute instance by running the following command. The Lustre client requires Amazon Linux kernel 4.14, version 104 or higher. 


uname -r


Do one of the following:
    If the command returns 4.14.104-78.84.amzn1.x86_64 or a higher version of 4.14, download and install the Lustre client with the following command.
sudo yum install -y lustre-client
     If the command returns a result less than 4.14.104-78.84.amzn1.x86_64, update the kernel and reboot your Amazon EC2 instance by running the following command. 
sudo yum -y update kernel && sudo reboot
Confirm that the kernel has been updated using the uname -r command. Then download and install the Lustre client as described above.


To Install the Lustre Client as an RPM Package (CentOS and Red Hat 7.5 or 7.6)


Open a terminal on your client.


Determine which kernel is currently running on the compute instance with the following command.


uname -r


Do one of the following:
    If the instance is running kernel version 3.10.0-862.*, download and install the Lustre 2.10.5 client with the following commands. The client comes in two packages to download and install.
sudo yum -y install https://downloads.whamcloud.com/public/lustre/lustre-2.10.5/el7/client/RPMS/x86_64/kmod-lustre-client-2.10.5-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

    If the instance is running kernel 3.10.0-1062.* or greater, see To Install the Lustre Client as an RPM Package (CentOS and Red Hat 7.7 and Newer) for instructions on how to install the Lustre Client from the Amazon FSx yum package repository.


Note
You might need to reboot your compute instance for the client to finish installing.
To Install the Lustre Client as an RPM Package (CentOS and Red Hat 7.7 and Newer)
Note
The following procedure is not for CentOS and Red Hat 8.
Lustre client packages that are compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS can be installed and updated from the Amazon FSx yum package repository. These packages are signed to ensure they have not been tampered with before or during download. Installation fails if the corresponding public key has not been installed on your system.


Open a terminal on your client.


Install the Amazon FSx rpm public key by using the following command.


sudo wget https://fsx-lustre-client-repo-public-keys.s3.amazonaws.com/fsx-rpm-public-key.asc -O /tmp/fsx-rpm-public-key.asc

Import the key by using the following command.

sudo rpm --import /tmp/fsx-rpm-public-key.asc

Add the repository and update the package manager. Use the following command.

sudo wget https://fsx-lustre-client-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/el/7/fsx-lustre-client.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/aws-fsx.repo
To stay on a specific version of RHEL and avoid moving to later versions as they are released, you can edit this repository configuration file.
To install a specific version of RHEL


Edit the repository configuration file to point to the specific version of RHEL that you want to stay on:


Install a specific version by providing the version in the following command. 
sudo sed -i 's#7#specific version#' /etc/yum.repos.d/aws-fsx.repo
For example, if you want to stay on version 7.7 specifically, substitute specific version with 7.7 in the command.
sudo sed -i 's#7#7.7#' /etc/yum.repos.d/aws-fsx.repo


Use the following command to clear the yum cache.
sudo yum clean all


Install the packages from the repository. Use the following command.


sudo yum install -y kmod-lustre-client lustre-client
Additional Information (CentOS and Red Hat 7.7 and Newer)
The commands preceding install the two packages that are necessary for mounting and interacting with your Amazon FSx file system. Additional Lustre packages such as a package containing the source code and packages containing tests are included in the repository, and you can optionally install them. To list all available packages in the repository, use the following command. 
yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="aws-fsx" list available
To download the source rpm, containing a tarball of the upstream source code and the set of patches we have applied, use the following command.
sudo yumdownloader --source kmod-lustre-client
When you run yum update, a more recent version of the module is installed if available and the existing version is replaced. To prevent the currently installed version from being removed on update, add a line like the following to your /etc/yum.conf file.
installonlypkgs=kernel, kernel-big‚Äêmem, kernel-enterprise, kernel-smp,
              kernel-debug, kernel-unsupported, kernel-source, kernel-devel, kernel-PAE,

To Install the Lustre Client as a .deb Package (Ubuntu 16.04)
You can get Lustre packages from the Ubuntu 16.04 Amazon FSx repository. To validate that the contents of the repository have not been tampered with before or during download, a GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) signature is applied to the metadata of the repository. Installing the repository fails unless you have the correct public GPG key installed on your system. 


Open a terminal on your client.
