Exporting files using HSM commands
Note
To export changes in your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system's data and metadata to its durable data repository on Amazon S3, use the approach described in Using data repository tasks to export data and metadata changes.
To export an individual file to your data repository and verify that the file has successfully been exported to your data repository, you can run the commands shown following. A return value of NOOP indicates that the file has successfully been exported.
sudo lfs hsm_archive path/to/export/file
sudo lfs hsm_action path/to/export/file
To export your entire file system or an entire directory in your file system, run the following commands. If you export multiple files simultaneously, Amazon FSx for Lustre exports your files to your Amazon S3 data repository in parallel.
nohup find local/directory -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 sudo lfs hsm_archive &
To determine whether the export has completed, run the following command.
find path/to/export/file -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 -P 8 sudo lfs hsm_action | grep "ARCHIVE" | wc -l
If the command returns with zero files remaining, then the export is complete.
