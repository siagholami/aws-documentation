Step 2: Install and Configure the Lustre Client on Your Instance Before Mounting Your File System
To mount your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system from your Amazon EC2 instance, first install the Lustre client.
To download the Lustre client onto your Amazon EC2 instance


Open a terminal on your client.


Determine which kernel is currently running on your compute instance by running the following command.


uname -r


Do one of the following:
    If the command returns 4.14.104-95.84.amzn2.x86_64 for x86-based EC2 instances, or 4.14.181-142.260.amzn2.aarch64 or higher for Graviton2-based EC2 instances, download and install the Lustre client with the following command.
sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lustre2.10
     If the command returns a result less than 4.14.104-95.84.amzn2.x86_64 for x86-based EC2 instances, or less than 4.14.181-142.260.amzn2.aarch64 for Graviton2-based EC2 instances, update the kernel and reboot your Amazon EC2 instance by running the following command. 
sudo yum -y update kernel && sudo reboot
Confirm that the kernel has been updated using the uname -r command. Then download and install the Lustre client as described above.


For information about installing the Lustre client on other Linux distributions, see Installing the Lustre Client.
To mount your file system

Make a directory for the mount point with the following command.

$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/fsx

Mount the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system to the directory that you created. Use the following command and replace the following items:
    Replace file_system_dns_name with the actual file system's Domain Name System (DNS) name.
    Replace mountname with the file system's mount name, which you can get by running the describe-file-systems AWS CLI command or the DescribeFileSystems API operation.

sudo mount -t lustre -o noatime,flock file_system_dns_name@tcp:/mountname /mnt/fsx
This command mounts your file system with two options, `-o noatime` and `flock`:


noatime – Turns off updates to inode access times. To update inode access times, use the mount command without noatime. 
flock – Enables file locking for your file system. If you don't want file locking enabled, use the mount command without flock. 


Verify that the mount command was successful by listing the contents of the directory to which you mounted the file system /mnt/fsx, by using the following command.

$ ls /mnt/fsx
   import-path  lustre
   $
You can also use the df command, following.
$ df
   Filesystem                      1K-blocks    Used  Available Use% Mounted on
   devtmpf                          1001808       0    1001808   0% /dev

The results show the Amazon FSx file system mounted on /mnt/fsx.
