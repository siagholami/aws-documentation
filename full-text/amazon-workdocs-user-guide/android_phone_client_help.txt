Getting started with Android
The Amazon WorkDocs Android phone and tablet applications allow you to view, comment on, and download documents from your Amazon WorkDocs files. You can also view, give feedback on, and download other organization documents for which you have been given permissions.
Download the Android application from Google Play or the Amazon Appstore for Android, and sign in with your organization name, user name, and password. The organization name and user name are provided in the welcome email that you received from your Amazon WorkDocs administrator. Your password was established when you completed the initial user registration. For more information, see Step 2: Register. 
To reset your password, choose Forgot password on the sign-in screen. If you need more help with signing in, contact your Amazon WorkDocs administrator.
