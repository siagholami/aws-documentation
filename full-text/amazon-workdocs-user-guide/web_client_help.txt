Signing in
When you launch the Amazon WorkDocs web client, sign in with your organization name, user name, and password. The organization name and user name are provided in the welcome email that you received from your Amazon WorkDocs administrator. Your password was established when you completed the initial user registration. For more information, see Step 2: Register. 
If your Amazon WorkDocs administrator has enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your organization, you are also prompted for a passcode to finish signing in. Your Amazon WorkDocs administrator provides information about how to get your passcode.
To reset your password, choose Forgot password on the sign-in screen. If you need more help with signing in, contact your Amazon WorkDocs administrator.
Enabling single sign-on
Amazon WorkDocs allows you to access Amazon WorkDocs from a computer that is joined to the same directory that Amazon WorkDocs is registered with, without having to enter your credentials separately. If your Amazon WorkDocs administrator has enabled single sign-on for your organization, you might need to take additional steps to allow your web browser to support single sign-on. For more information, see Single sign-on for IE and Chrome and Single sign-on for Firefox in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide.
Note
Single sign-on only works when used on a computer that is joined to the AWS Directory Service directory. It can't be used on computers not joined to the directory.
