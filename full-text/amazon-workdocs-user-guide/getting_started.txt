Getting started with Amazon WorkDocs
Use Amazon WorkDocs to store and share documents, give and receive document feedback, and collaborate with others in your Amazon WorkDocs organization. You can access Amazon WorkDocs on the web, or install apps for Android and iOS devices. Download and install the Amazon WorkDocs apps from Apps & Integrations for Amazon WorkDocs. 
Step 1: Get invited
Participation in an Amazon WorkDocs organization is by invitation only. Your Amazon WorkDocs administrator creates an organization and invites the users to join that organization. An administrator can also enable other people in the organization to invite others to join the organization. 
You will receive communication from your Amazon WorkDocs administrator with information about how to register (if necessary) and where to download the client applications from.
Step 2: Register
When you receive your invitation to join an Amazon WorkDocs organization, you may need to complete your user registration. Completing your registration involves setting your user information, which includes the following:
 First name
 Last name
 Password
You can change your profile photo, timezone, and password from your account after you complete your registration. For more information, see Updating your user profile.
