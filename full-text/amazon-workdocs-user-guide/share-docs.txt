Sharing files and folders
You can share a folder or file with other users and groups both within and outside your organization. Share by sending a link, or share by sending an invite to a user's email address. When you share by invite, you choose which permissions to grant to the users that you're sharing with. For more information about permissions, see Permissions.
You can also revoke shares, and users can remove themselves from the share. To see a list of users that have access to a file or folder, select the file or folder, then choose Share, Permissions.
To see a list of all the changes that users have made to your files and folders, view your activity feed. For more information, see Tracking file activity.
Note
You can only share with directory groups, not email distribution lists.
