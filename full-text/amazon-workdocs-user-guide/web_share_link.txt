Sharing a link
Share files and folders stored in Amazon WorkDocs by sharing the link to the file or folder with others. You can share a file link with coworkers and external partners, both inside and outside your organization. A folder link can only be shared with internal site members.
You can configure a file link to allow access to site members only, or to anyone on the internet. Site members can open the link to view, comment on, update, or delete the file. A public file link is restricted to viewing only. For a file link, you can also set an expiration date and a 4-digit passcode for access to the file.
