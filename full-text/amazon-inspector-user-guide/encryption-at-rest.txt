Encryption of data at rest
The telemetry data that an Amazon Inspector agent generates during assessment runs is formatted in JSON files. These files are delivered in near-real-time over TLS to Amazon Inspector, where they are encrypted with a per-assessment-run, ephemeral AWS KMS-derived key.
The files are securely stored in S3 buckets that are dedicated to Amazon Inspector. The rules engine of Amazon Inspector does the following:
 Accesses the encrypted telemetry data in the S3 bucket
 Decrypts it in memory 
 Processes the data against the configured assessment rules to generate findings
