Assessment reports
An Amazon Inspector assessment report is a document that details what is tested in the assessment run and the results of the assessment. You can store the reports, share them with your team for remediation actions, or use them to augment your compliance audit data. You can generate a report for an assessment run after the run has successfully completed. 
Note
You can generate reports only for assessment runs that occur after April 25, 2017, which is when assessment reports in Amazon Inspector became available.
You can view the following types of assessment reports:
 Findings report – this report contains the following information:
   Summary of the assessment
   EC2 instances evaluated during the assessment run
   Rules packages included in the assessment run
   Detailed information about each finding, including all EC2 instances that had the finding
 Full report – this report contains all the information that is included in a findings report, and additionally provides the list of rules that were checked against the instances in the assessment target.
To generate an assessment report


On the Assessment runs page, locate the assessment run that you want to generate a report for. Make sure that its status is set to Analysis complete.


Under the Reports column for this assessment run, choose the reports icon. 
Important
The reports icon is present in the Reports column only for those assessment runs that took place or will take place after April 25, 2017. That is when assessment reports in Amazon Inspector became available.


In the Assessment report dialog box, choose the type of report that you want to view (either a Findings or a Full report) and the report format (HTML or PDF). Then choose Generate report.


You can also generate assessment reports through the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/APIReference/API_GetAssessmentReport.html API.

To delete a report
