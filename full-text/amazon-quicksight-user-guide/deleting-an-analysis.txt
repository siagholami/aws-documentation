Deleting an Analysis
You can delete an analysis by using the All analyses tab of the Amazon QuickSight start page. Deleting an analysis doesn't affect any dashboards that are based on that analysis.
To remove an analysis, choose the details icon ( â‹® ) on the analysis, and choose Delete. Confirm your choice by choosing Delete again.
