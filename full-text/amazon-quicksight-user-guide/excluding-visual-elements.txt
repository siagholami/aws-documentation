Excluding Visual Elements
When viewing visuals, you can choose an element (like a bar or bubble, or a row or column header in the case of a pivot table), and then choose to exclude the element. The exception is that you can't exclude elements that are mapped to date fields. You can exclude multiple elements on a single chart.
Excluding the element creates a filter that removes only that element from the visual:


To see the excluded element again, either choose Undo on the application bar, or disable or delete the filter.
For more information about filters, see Filtering Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight.
