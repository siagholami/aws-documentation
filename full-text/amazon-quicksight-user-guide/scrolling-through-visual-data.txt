Scrolling Through Visual Data
For bar charts, line charts, and pivot tables, creating a visual on a large data set can result in more visual elements than can be fit into the page length or width. In these cases, scroll bars are provided so that you can page through the data. Drag the scroll bar slider to view different areas of the chart.

On bar charts and line charts, you can also adjust the length of the slider to reflect a greater or lesser proportion of the chart. To do this, choose one of the gray handles on either end of the slider and drag it to adjust the slider size.
