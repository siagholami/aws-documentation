Focusing on Visual Elements
When viewing visuals, you can choose an element on the visual, and then choose to focus on the element. Elements to focus on can include, for example, a bar or bubble, or a row or column header in the case of a pivot table.
Focusing on the element creates a filter that removes all other elements except for the one you selected:


To see the other elements again, either choose Undo on the application bar, or disable or delete the filter.
For more information about filters, see Filtering Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight.
