Supported Data Sources
Amazon QuickSight supports a variety of data sources that you can use to provide data for analyses. The following data sources are supported:
Relational Data Sources
You can use any of the following relational data stores as data sources for Amazon QuickSight:
 Amazon Athena
 Amazon Aurora
 Amazon Redshift
 Amazon Redshift Spectrum
 Amazon S3
 Amazon S3 Analytics
 Apache Spark 2.0 or later
 MariaDB 10.0 or later
 Microsoft SQL Server 2012 or later
 MySQL 5.1 or later
 PostgreSQL 9.3.1 or later
 Presto 0.167 or later
 Snowflake
 Teradata 14.0 or later
Note
You can access additional data sources not listed here by linking or importing them through supported data sources.
You can retrieve data from tables and materialized views in PostgreSQL instances, and from tables in all other database instances.
Amazon Redshift clusters, Amazon Athena databases, and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances must be in AWS. Other database instances must be in one of the following environments to be accessible from Amazon QuickSight:
 Amazon EC2
 On your local network
 In a data center or some other internet-accessible environment
File Data Sources
You can use files in Amazon S3 or on your local network as data sources for Amazon QuickSight. Amazon QuickSight supports files in the following formats:
 CSV/TSV – Delimited text files
 ELF/CLF – Extended and common log format files
 JSON – Flat or semi-structured data files
 XLSX – Microsoft Excel files
Files in Amazon S3 that have been compressed with zip, or gzip (www.gzip.org), can be imported as-is. If you used another compression program for files in Amazon S3, or if the files are on your local network, you need to unzip them before importing them.
JSON Data Sources
Amazon QuickSight natively supports JSON flat files and JSON semi structure data files.
You can either upload a JSON file or connect to your Amazon S3 bucket that contains JSON data. Amazon QuickSight automatically performs schema and type inference on JSON files and embedded JSON objects. Then it flattens the JSON, so you can analyze and visualize application-generated data. 
Basic support for JSON flat file data includes the following:
 Inferring the schema
 Determining data types
 Flattening the data
 Parsing JSON (JSON embedded objects) from flat files
Support for JSON file structures (.json) includes the following:
 JSON records with structures
 JSON records with root elements as arrays
You can also use the parseJson function to extract values from JSON objects in a text file. For example, if your CSV file has a JSON object embedded in one of the fields, you can extract a value from a specified key value pair (KVP). For more information on how to do this, see parseJson.
The following JSON features aren't supported:
 Reading JSON with a structure containing a list of records
 List attributes and list objects within a JSON record are skipped during import
 Customizing upload or configuration settings
 parseJSON functions for SQL and analyses
 Error messaging for invalid JSON
 Extracting a JSON object from a JSON structure
 Reading delimited JSON records
You can use the parseJson function to parse flat files during data preparation. This function extracts elements from valid JSON structures and lists.
The following JSON values are supported:
 JSON object
 String (double quoted)
 Number (integer and float)
 Boolean
 NULL
Software as a Service (SaaS) Data Sources
The following list shows which SaaS data sources are currently supported by Amazon QuickSight. The ones that aren't labeled "direct connection" use OAuth to connect instead. For sources using OAuth, the connector takes you to the SaaS site to authorize the connection before letting you create the data source.
Note
For this to work, the SaaS data source must be accessible to Amazon QuickSight over the network.
 Adobe Analytics
 GitHub
 JIRA (direct connection)
 Salesforce
You can use reports or objects in the following editions of Salesforce as data sources for Amazon QuickSight. Joined reports aren't supported as Amazon QuickSight data sources.
   Enterprise Edition
   Unlimited Edition
   Developer Edition
 ServiceNow (direct connection)
