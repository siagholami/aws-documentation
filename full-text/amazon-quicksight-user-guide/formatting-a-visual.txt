You can customize the following options:
 Position, which determines where the label appears in relation to the data point (for bar, combo, and line charts):
   For vertical bar charts, you can customize to set position:
     Above bars
     Inside of bars
     Bottom of bars
     Top of bars
   For horizontal bar charts, you can customize to set position:
     Right of bars
     Inside of bars
   For line charts, you can customize to set position:
     Above lines
     Left or right of points on lines
     Below lines
   For scatter charts, you can customize to set position:
     Above points
     Left or right of points
     Below points
 Font size and color (for bar, combo, line, scatter, and pie charts)
 Label pattern, which determines how data is labeled (for bar, combo, line, and scatter charts):
   For bar, combo, line, and scatter charts, you can label:
     All 
     By group/color
   For lines, the following additional label options are available:
     Line ends
     Minimum or maximum value only
     Minimum and maximum values
 Group selection (for bars and lines, when the label pattern is "by group/color")
 Allow labels to overlap (for bars and lines), for use with fewer data points
Use the following procedure to configure data labels.


On the analysis page, choose the visual that you want to format.


Choose the on-visual menu at the upper-right corner of the visual, and then choose Format visual.



On the Format Visual pane, choose Data Labels. 


Enable Show data labels to show and customize labels. Disable this option to hide data labels.


Choose the settings that you want to use. The settings offered are slightly different for each chart type. To see all available options, see the list before this procedure. 


You can immediately view the effect of each change on the visual. 

Close the Format Visual pane by choosing the X icon in the upper-right corner of the pane.

Changing the Visual Scale with the Axis Range
To change the scale of the values shown on the visual, you can use the Format Visual pane to set the range for one or both axes of the visual. This option is available for the value axis on bar charts, combo charts, line charts, and scatter plots. 
By default, the axis range starts at 0 and ends with the highest value for the measure being displayed. For the group-by axis, you can use the data zoom tool on the visual to dynamically adjust the scale.
Use the following procedure to set the axis range for a visual. 


On the analysis page, select the visual that you want to format.


Choose the on-visual menu at the upper-right corner of the visual, and then choose Format visual.



On the Format Visual pane, choose X-Axis or Y-axis, depending on what type of visual you are customizing. This is the X-Axis section for horizontal bar charts, the Y-Axis section for vertical bar charts and line charts, and both axes are available for scatter plots. On combo charts, use Bars and Lines instead. 


Enter a new name in the box to rename the axis. To revert to the default name, delete your entry.



Set the range for the axis by choosing one of the following options:
    Choose Auto (starting at 0) to have the range start at 0 and end around the highest value for the measure being displayed.
    Choose Auto (based on data range) to have the range start at the lowest value for the measure being displayed and end around the highest value for the measure being displayed.
    Choose Custom range to have the range start and end at values that you specify.
If you choose Custom range, enter the start and end values in the fields in that section. Typically, you use integers for the range values. For stacked 100 percent bar charts, use a decimal value to indicate the percentage that you want. For example, if you want the range to be 0–30 percent instead of 0–100 percent, enter 0 for the start value and .3 for the end value.


To customize the number of values to show on the axis, enter in an integer between 1 and 50.


Close the Format Visual pane by choosing the X icon in the upper-right corner of the pane.
