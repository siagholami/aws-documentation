Creating a Data Set Using an Existing Data Source
After you make an initial connection to a Salesforce, AWS data store, or other database data source, Amazon QuickSight saves the connection information and adds the data source to the FROM EXISTING DATA SOURCES section of the Create a Data Set page. You can use these existing data sources to create new data sets without re-specifying connection information.
Creating a Data Set Using an Existing Amazon S3 Data Source
Use the following procedure to create a data set using an existing Amazon S3 data source.


On the Amazon QuickSight start page, choose Manage data.


On the Your Data Sets page, choose New data set.


In the FROM EXISTING DATA SOURCES section of the Create a Data Set page, choose the Amazon S3 data source to use.


To prepare the data before creating the data set, choose Edit/Preview data, to create an analysis using the data as-is, choose Visualize.


Creating a Data Set Using an Existing Amazon Athena Data Source
If you want to create a data set using an existing Amazon Athena data source, use the following procedure.
To create a data set using an existing Amazon Athena data source


On the Amazon QuickSight start page, choose Manage data.


On the Your Data Sets page, choose New data set.


In the FROM EXISTING DATA SOURCES section of the Create a Data Set page, choose the Athena data source to use.


Choose Create data set.


Choose one of the following:
    Custom SQL
On the next screen, you can choose to write a query with the Use custom SQL option. Doing this opens a screen named Enter custom SQL query, where you can type a name for your query, and then enter the SQL. For best results, compose the query in a SQL editor, and then paste it into this window. After you name and enter the query, you can choose Edit/Preview data or Confirm query. Choose Edit/Preview data to immediately go to data preparation. Choose Confirm query to validate the SQL and make sure that there are no errors.
    Choose tables
If you prefer to connect to specific tables, for Schema: contain sets of tables, choose Select and then choose a schema. In some cases where there is only a single schema in the database, that schema is automatically chosen, and the schema selection option isn't displayed.
To prepare the data before creating an analysis, choose Edit/Preview data to open data preparation. Use this option if you want to join to more tables.
Otherwise, after choosing a table, choose Select.


If you didn't choose to prepare the data in the previous step, the following screen appears.



To load your data into SPICE, choose Import to SPICE. The green indicator shows whether or not you have space available. 
Alternatively, you can choose to query your data without using SPICE. To do this, choose Directly query your data.

After choosing how to query your data, choose one of the following options:
    To prepare the data before creating an analysis, choose Edit/Preview data to begin data preparation for the selected table. For more information about data preparation, see Preparing Data Sets.
    To create a data set and analyze the data using the table as-is, choose Visualize.

Otherwise, after choosing a table, choose Select.



On the next screen, choose one of the following options:
    To create a data set and an analysis using the data as-is, choose Visualize.
Note
If you don't have enough SPICE capacity, choose Edit/Preview data. In data preparation, you can remove fields from the data set to decrease its size or apply a filter that reduces the number of rows returned. For more information about data preparation, see Preparing Data Sets.

    To prepare the data before creating an analysis, choose Edit/Preview data to open data preparation for the selected report or object. For more information about data preparation, see Preparing Data Sets.

    To prepare the data before creating an analysis, choose Edit/Preview data to open data preparation for the selected table. For more information about data preparation, see Preparing Data Sets.
    To create a data set and an analysis using the table data as-is, and to import the data set data into SPICE for improved performance (recommended), check the SPICE indicator to see if you have enough space.

If you have enough SPICE capacity, choose Import to SPICE for quicker analytics, and then create an analysis by choosing Visualize.
Note
If you want to use SPICE and you don't have enough space, choose Edit/Preview data. In data preparation, you can remove fields from the data set to decrease its size, apply a filter, or write a SQL query that reduces the number of rows or columns returned. For more information about data preparation, see Preparing Data Sets.

    To create a data set and an analysis using the table data as-is, and to have the data queried directly from the database, choose the Directly query your data option, and then create an analysis by choosing Visualize.
