Adding a Numeric Filter
Fields with decimal or int data types are considered numeric fields. You create filters on numeric fields by specifying a comparison type, for example Greater than or Between, and a comparison value or values as appropriate to the comparison type. Comparison values must be positive integers and should not contain commas.
You can use the following comparison types in numeric filters:
 Equals
 Does not equal
 Greater than
 Less than
 Greater than or equal to
 Less than or equal to
 Between
Note
To use a top and bottom filter for numeric data, first change the field from a measure to a dimension. Doing this converts the data to text. Then you can use a text filter. For more information, see Adding a Text Filter.  

For data sets based on database queries, you can also optionally apply an aggregate function to the comparison value or values, for example Sum or Average. 
You can use the following aggregate functions in numeric filters:
 Average
 Count
 Max
 Min
 Sum
Creating a Numeric Filter
Use the following procedure to create a numeric field filter.


Choose Filter on the tool bar.


On the Applied filters pane, choose the new filter icon, and then choose a numeric field to filter on.


This creates a new filter with no criteria.



Choose the new filter to expand it.


If you want to aggregate, choose the aggregation type.



Choose a comparison type.



Choose one of the following:
    To use literal values, enter the comparison value or values. If you chose a comparison type other than Between, enter one comparison value. If you chose a comparison type of Between, enter the beginning of the value range in Minimum value and the end of the value range in Maximum value.

    To use an existing parameter, enable Use parameters, then choose your parameter from the list.

You must create your parameters first before they can appear in this list. Usually, you create a parameter, add a control for it, and then add a filter for it. For more information, see Parameters in Amazon QuickSight.


Choose Apply.
