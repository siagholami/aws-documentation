Quick Start: Create an Analysis with a Single Visual Using Sample Data
Use the following procedure to use the Web and Social Media Analytics sample data set to create an analysis containing a line chart visual. This visual shows the count by month of people that have added themselves to the mailing list. 

On the Amazon QuickSight start page, choose New analysis. If you don't have the sample data, you can download it from http://quicksightsampledata.s3.amazonaws.com/MarketingData_QuickSightSample.csv. 

To upload the sample data, use the following steps:


Choose New data set from the New analysis screen. (Or, choose Manage data to locate the New data set screen.)


Choose Upload a file.


Choose the sample file, MarketingData_QuickSightSample.csv, from your drive.


Confirm file upload settings by choosing Next on the Confirm file upload settings screen.


Choose Visualize on the Data source details screen.


Skip the next step. Choosing Visualize brings you to the same screen as the process in Step 2.


On the Your data sets page, choose the Web and Social Media Analytics data set, and then choose Create Analysis.



In the Fields list pane, choose Date, and then choose Mailing list adds. 



Amazon QuickSight uses AutoGraph to create the visual, selecting the visual type that it determines is most compatible with those fields. In this case, it selects a line chart that shows mailing list adds by year, which is the date granularity default.



Expand the Field wells pane by choosing the expand icon. 



Choose the X axis field well, choose Aggregate, and then choose Month.



The line chart updates to show mailing list adds by month, rather than by the default of by year.
