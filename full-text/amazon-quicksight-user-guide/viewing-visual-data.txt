Viewing Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight
Amazon QuickSight offers a variety of ways to see the details of the data being displayed in a visual. The axes or rows and columns of the visual (depending on the visual type) have labels, and hovering over any graphical element in a visual displays the data associated with that element. Some visual types use visual cues to emphasize the element you are hovering over and make it easier to differentiate, for example by changing the color of the element, or highlighting it.
