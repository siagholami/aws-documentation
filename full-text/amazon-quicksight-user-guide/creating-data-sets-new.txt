Creating Data Sets Using New Data Sources
To create a data set from a new data source, you must provide connection information to the data source.
 For local text or Excel files, you can simply identify the file location and upload the file.
 For Amazon S3, you must provide a manifest identifying the files or buckets that you want to use, and also the import settings for the target files.
 For Amazon Athena, all Athena databases associated with your AWS account are returned. No additional credentials are required.
 For Salesforce, you must provide credentials to connect with.
 For Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, Amazon EC2, or other database data sources, you must provide information about the server and database that host the data, as well as valid credentials for that instance.
