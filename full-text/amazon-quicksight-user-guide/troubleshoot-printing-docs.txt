I Get a Feedback Bar Across My Printed Docs
The browser sometimes prints the document feedback bar across the page, blocking some printed content.
To avoid this problem, use the twirl-down icon on the bottom left of the screen to minimize the feedback bar. Then print your document.

We always welcome your feedback on our documentation!
