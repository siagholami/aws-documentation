Duplicating a Data Set
You can duplicate an existing data set to save a copy of it with a new name. The new data set is a completely separate copy.
If you want to create a copy of the data set, open the Your Data Sets page and choose the data set that you want to make a copy of. Then choose Duplicate data set, and type a name for the copy.
