Parameters in Amazon QuickSight
Parameters are named variables that can transfer a value for use by an action or an object. They let you create an easier way for a dashboard user to interact with dashboard features in a less technical way. Parameters can also connect one dashboard to another, allowing a dashboard user to drill down into data that's in a different analysis.
For example, a dashboard user can use a list to choose a value. That value sets a parameter that in turn sets a filter, calculation, or URL action to the chosen value. Then the visuals in the dashboard react to the user's choices. 
To make the parameters accessible to the dashboard viewer, you add a parameter control. You can set up cascading controls, so that a selection in one control filters the options that display in another control. A control can appear as a list of options, a slider, or a text entry area. If you don't create a control, you can still pass a value to your parameter in the dashboard URL.
For parameters to work, whether or not they have a related control, they need to be connected to something in your analysis. You can reference them in the following:
 Calculated fields (except for multivalue parameters)
 Filters
 Dashboard and analysis URLs
 URL actions
Some ways that you can use parameters are the following:
 Using a calculation, you can transform data that is shown in an analysis. 
 If you add a control with a filter to an analysis you are publishing, the dashboard users can filter the data without creating their own filters.
 Using controls and URL actions, you can let dashboard users set values for the URL actions.
