sort order field 
One or more measures and dimensions that you want to sort the data by, separated by commas. You can specify either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) sort order. 
Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).

Example
The following example calculates the percentage of difference between the sum(Sales) for the current and the previous State, sorted by Sales.
percentDifference
(
     sum(amount), 
     [sum(amount) ASC],
     -1, 
     [State]
)
The following example calculates the percent that a specific Billed Amount is of another Billed Amount, sorted by ([{Customer Region} ASC]). This example uses the revenue sample dataset, located in an Amazon S3 bucket. The fields in the table calculation are in the field wells of the visual.
percentDifference(
     sum( {Billed Amount} ), 
     [{Customer Region} ASC],
     1
)
The following screenshot shows the results of the example. The red letters show that the total Billed Amount for the Customer Region APAC is 24 percent less than the amount for the EMEA region.
