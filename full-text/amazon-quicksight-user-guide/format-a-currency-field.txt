Format a Currency Field
When you format a currency field, you can either choose the currency symbol from a list of common options, or open the Format Data pane and manually format the field. Manually formatting the field allows you to choose what symbol to use, what separators to use, the number of decimal places to show, what units to use, and how to display negative numbers.
Changing a field format changes it for all visuals in the analysis, but does not change it in the underlying data set.
Format a Currency Field Using List Options
If you want to choose the symbol for a currency field from a list of common options, you can access such a list from the Field list pane, an on-visual editor, or a visual field well.
Use the following procedure to select a currency field's symbol by choosing a list option.


Choose one of the following options:
    In the Field list pane, choose the selector icon to the right of the currency field you want to format.
    On any visual that contains an on-visual editor associated with the currency field you want to format, choose that on-visual editor.
    Expand the Field wells pane, then choose the field well associated with the currency field you want to change.


Choose Symbol, and then choose the symbol you want. The following symbols are offered for currency fields:
    Display in dollars ($).
    Display in pounds (£).
    Display in euros (€).
    Display in yen (¥).

The Format Data pane opens.



Expand the Symbol section and choose from the following options:
    Display in dollars ($). This is the default.
    Display in pounds (£).
    Display in euros (€).
    Display in yen (¥).



Expand the Separators section and choose from the following options:
    Under Decimal, choose a dot or a comma for the decimal separator. A dot is the default. If you choose a comma instead, you must use a dot or a space as the thousands separator.
    Under Thousands, select or deselect Enabled to indicate whether you want to use a thousands separator. Enabled is selected by default.
    If you are using a thousands separator, choose whether to use a comma, dot, or space for the separator. A comma is the default. If you choose a dot instead, you must use a comma as the decimal separator.



Expand the Decimal Places section and choose the number of decimal places to use. The default is 2. Field values are rounded to the decimal places specified. For example, if you specify two decimal places, the value 6.728 is rounded to 6.73.



Expand the Units section and choose from the following options:
    Choose the unit to use. Choosing a unit adds the appropriate suffix to the number value. For example, if you choose Thousands, a field value of 1234 displays as 1.234K.
The unit options are as follows:
  No unit suffix. This is the default.
  Thousands (K)
  Millions (M)
  Billions (B)
  Trillions (T)
    If you want to use a custom prefix or suffix, specify it in the Prefix or Suffix box. Using a custom suffix is a good way to specify a currency suffix outside of those already offered by Amazon QuickSight. You can specify both, and you can also specify a custom prefix in addition to the suffix added by selecting a unit.



Expand the Negatives section and choose whether to display a negative value by using a minus sign or by enclosing it in parentheses. Using a minus sign is the default.
