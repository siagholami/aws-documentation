Creating an Analysis
Use the following procedure to create a new analysis.


On the All analyses tab of the Amazon QuickSight start page, choose New analysis. You are taken to the Your Data Sets page.


Choose a data set and then choose Create analysis.



If you don't have any data sets, create a new one by choosing New data set. You can create an analysis as the last step in creating a new data set. For more information about creating a data set, see Creating Data Sets.

Create a visual. For more information about creating visuals, see Creating an Amazon QuickSight Visual.

After you are done creating the analysis, you can iterate on it by modifying the visual, adding additional visuals, adding scenes to the default story, or adding additional stories.
