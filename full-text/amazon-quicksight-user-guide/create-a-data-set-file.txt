Creating a Data Set Using a Local Text File
To create a data set using a local text file data source, identify the location of the file, and then upload it. The file data will be automatically imported into SPICE as part of creating a data set. 
Use the following procedure to create a data set based on a local text file.

Check Data Source Limits to make sure that your target file doesn't exceed data source limits.

Supported file types include .csv, .tsv, .json, .clf, or .elf files.


On the Amazon QuickSight start page, choose Manage data.


On the Your Data Sets page, choose New data set.


In the FROM NEW DATA SOURCES section of the Create a Data Set page, choose Upload a file.


In the Open dialog box, browse to a file, select it, and then choose Open.


A file must be 1 GB or less to be uploaded to Amazon QuickSight.

To prepare the data before creating the data set, choose Edit/Preview data, otherwise choose Visualize to create an analysis using the data as-is. If you choose the former, you can specify a data set name as part of preparing the data. If you choose the latter, a data set with the same name as the source file is created. To learn more about data preparation, see Preparing Data.
