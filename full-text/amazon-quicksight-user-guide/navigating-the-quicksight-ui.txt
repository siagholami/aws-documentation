Navigating the User Interface
This chapter explains briefly how to use the Amazon QuickSight user interface. After you sign in to Amazon QuickSight, you see the Amazon QuickSight start page. The start page provides tabs for your analyses, your dashboards, and our tutorial videos. It also provides options for searching Amazon QuickSight, accessing your user account, creating new analyses, and managing data sources.
