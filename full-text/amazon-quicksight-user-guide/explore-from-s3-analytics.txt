Exploring Amazon S3 Analytics Data
Amazon QuickSight contains a dashboard designed to provide insight into your Amazon S3 analytics data. To use this feature, you must first enable S3 analytics storage class analysis for your S3 buckets. For more on enabling storage class analysis in S3, see Amazon S3 Analytics – Storage Class Analysis in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide. *
After you have enabled storage class analysis, you can use Amazon QuickSight to explore your S3 analytics data.
To explore S3 analytics data in Amazon QuickSight


Open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


Choose a bucket to explore. The bucket must have storage class analysis enabled, with at least one filter.


Choose the Management tab.


Then Choose Analytics.


Choose Explore in QuickSight.
Note
If you don't have an Amazon QuickSight account, you're prompted to create one before you can use the dashboard.



When you choose the option to explore in Amazon QuickSight, your S3 analytics data is automatically loaded into the dashboard template. The dashboard contains multiple visualizations to help you to understand the storage access pattern of your bucket. 
Use the template as is, or customize it to suit your needs. For example, one visual on the default template helps you identify infrequently accessed data. It compares the amount of data retrieved to the amount of storage consumed, for objects of different ages.

You can also add your own visualizations to the dashboard. For example, you can break down the data access patterns, using filters for storage class analysis that you already have defined in S3 analytics.
