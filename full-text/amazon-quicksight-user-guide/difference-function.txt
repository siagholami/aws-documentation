difference
difference calculates the difference between a measure based on one set of partitions and sorts, and a measure based on another. 
difference is supported for use with analyses based on SPICE and direct query data sets.
Syntax
The brackets are required. To see which arguments are optional, see the following descriptions.
difference
(
     measure 
     ,[ sortorder_field ASC_or_DESC, ... ]
     ,lookup_index,
     ,[ partition field, ... ] 
)
Arguments
measure 
An aggregated measure that you want to see the difference for. 
sort order field 
One or more measures and dimensions that you want to sort the data by, separated by commas. You can specify either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) sort order. 
Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).
lookup index 
The lookup index can be 1 or -1, indicating the next row in the sort (1) or the previous row in the sort (-1). 
partition field 
(Optional) One or more dimensions that you want to partition by, separated by commas. 
Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).
Example
The following example calculates the difference between of sum({Billed Amount}), sorted by Customer Region ascending, compared to the next row, and partitioned by Service Line.
difference(
     sum( {Billed Amount} ), 
     [{Customer Region} ASC],
     1,
     [{Service Line}]
)
The following example calculates the difference between Billed Amount compared to the next line, partitioned by ([{Customer Region}]). This example uses the revenue sample dataset, located in an Amazon S3 bucket. The fields in the table calculation are in the field wells of the visual.
difference(
     sum( {Billed Amount} ), 
     [{Customer Region} ASC],
     1
)
The red highlights show how each amount is added ( a  b = c ) to show the difference between amounts a and c.
