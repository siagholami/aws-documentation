Changing the Field Associated with a Visual Element
You can change the field assigned to an element in a visual by using the field wells, drop targets, or the on-visual editors on the visual. For pivot tables, you must use field wells or drop targets as this visual type does not provide on-visual editors.

Use the following procedure to modify the mapping of a field to a visual element.


On the visual, choose the on-visual editor for the visual element for which you want to change the field.


On the on-visual editor menu, choose the field that you want to associate with that visual element.



Changing a Field Mapping by Using a Drop Target
To modify the mapping of a field to a visual element by using a drop target, choose a field in the Fields list pane. Then drag the field to a drop target on the visual, making sure that the drop indicator shows that the field is being replaced.
