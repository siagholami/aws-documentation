Setting Your IAM Policy
You can use AWS root credentials or IAM user credentials to create an Amazon QuickSight account. AWS root and administrator credentials already have all of the required permissions for managing Amazon QuickSight access to AWS resources. 
However, we recommend that you protect your root credentials, and instead use IAM user credentials. To do this, you can create a policy and attach it to the IAM user and roles that you plan to use for Amazon QuickSight. The policy must include the appropriate statements for the Amazon QuickSight administrative tasks you need to perform, as described in the following sections.
Important
Be aware of the following when working with Amazon QuickSight and IAM policies:
Avoid directly modifying a policy that was created by Amazon QuickSight. When you modify it yourself, Amazon QuickSight can't edit it. This inability can cause an issue with the policy. To fix this issue, delete the previously modified policy. 
If you get an error on permissions when you try to create an Amazon QuickSight account, see IAM Policy Actions for Creating Users in Amazon QuickSight. 
In some cases, you might have an Amazon QuickSight account that you can't access even from the root account (for example, if you accidentally deleted its directory service). In this case, you can delete your old Amazon QuickSight account, then recreate it. For more information, see Canceling Your Amazon QuickSight Subscription and Closing the Account.
IAM Policy Actions for Signing Up for Amazon QuickSight
To allow a user to sign up and set permissions to AWS resources for Amazon QuickSight, allow the following actions in an IAM policy. For more information, see Managing Amazon QuickSight Permissions to AWS Resources. 
The permissions for signing up don't allow you to fully use Amazon QuickSight. However, a user with the AWS root and administrator credentials can subscribe to Amazon QuickSight with no additional actions needed.
