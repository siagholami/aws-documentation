Setup a Free Standalone User Account in Amazon QuickSight
This section covers the fastest way to setup a free Amazon QuickSight account. 
If you have only one user (author or admin), you can use Amazon QuickSight for free. If your team wants to try out Amazon QuickSight, you can sign up for a 60 day free trial for up to 4 additional users (author or admin). After the trial is over, you can reduce the number of users to 1 only, and then the Amazon QuickSight account remains free. 
If you want to conduct a trial with a larger number than five users, you can still sign up this way. However, you are billed for users over five during the first sixty days, and users over 1 thereafter.
Note
You can only create users in the reader role in Enterprise edition. They aren't as part of the free trial.
