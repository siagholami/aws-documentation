View pipeline details and history (console)
You can use the CodePipeline console to view a list of all of the pipelines in your account. You can also view details for each pipeline, including when actions last ran in the pipeline, whether a transition between stages is enabled or disabled, whether any actions have failed, and other information. You can also view a history page that shows details for all pipeline executions for which history has been recorded. Execution history is retained for up to 12 months.
Note
Detailed execution history is available for executions run on or after February 21, 2019.

To view a pipeline

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodePipeline console at http://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home.

The names and creation date of all pipelines associated with your AWS account are displayed, along with links to view execution history.

To see details for a single pipeline, in Name, choose the pipeline. You can also select the pipeline, and then choose View pipeline. A detailed view of the pipeline, including the state of each action in each stage and the state of the transitions, is displayed.


The graphical view displays the following information for each stage:
    The stage name.
    Every action configured for the stage.
    The state of transitions between stages (enabled or disabled), as indicated by the state of the arrow between stages. An enabled transition is indicated by an arrow with a Disable transition button next to it. A disabled transition is indicated by an arrow with a strikeout under it and an Enable transition button next to it.
    A color bar to indicate the status of the stage:
      Gray: No executions yet
      Blue: In progress
      Green: Succeeded
      Red: Failed
The graphical view also displays the following information about actions in each stage:
    The name of the action.
    The provider of the action, such as CodeDeploy.
    When the action was last run.
    Whether the action succeeded or failed.
    Links to other details about the last run of the action, where available.
    Details about the source revisions that are running through the latest pipeline execution in the stage or, for CodeDeploy deployments, the latest source revisions that were deployed to target instances.


To see the configuration details for an action in a stage of a pipeline, choose the information icon next to the action.


To view the details of the provider of the action, choose the provider. For example, in the preceding example pipeline, if you choose CodeDeploy in either the Staging or Production stages the CodeDeploy console page for the deployment group configured for that stage is displayed.


To see the progress details for an action in a stage, choose Details when it is displayed next to an action in progress (indicated by an In Progress message). If the action is in progress, you see the incremental progress and the steps or actions as they occur. 
Note
Details are available for source actions that retrieve content from GitHub repositories, but not those that retrieve content from Amazon S3 buckets or CodeCommit repositories.


To approve or reject actions that have been configured for manual approval, choose Review.


To retry actions in a stage that were not completed successfully, choose Retry.


To get more information about errors or failures for a completed action in a stage, choose Details. Details from the last time the action ran, including the results of that action (Succeeded or Failed) are displayed.


To view details about source artifacts (output artifact that originated in the first stage of a pipeline) that are used the latest pipeline execution for a stage, click in the details information area at the bottom of the stage. You can view details about identifiers, such as commit IDs, check-in comments, and the time since the artifact was created or updated. 


To view details about the most recent executions for the pipeline, choose View history. For past executions, you can view revision details associated with source artifacts, such as execution IDs, status, start and end times, duration, and commit IDs and messages.


View pipeline execution history (console)
You can use the console to view the history of executions in a pipeline, including status, source revisions, and timing details for each execution.

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodePipeline console at http://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home.

In Name, choose the name of the pipeline.


Choose View history.


View the status, source revisions, change details, and triggers related to each execution for your pipeline.



Choose an execution. The detail view shows execution details, the Timeline tab, and the Visualization tab.



View execution status (console)
You can view the pipeline status in Status on the execution history page. Choose an execution ID link, and then view the action status.
The following are valid states for pipelines, stages, and actions:
Pipeline-level states 



Pipeline state
Description




InProgress
The pipeline execution is currently running.


Stopping
The pipeline execution is stopping due to a request to either stop and wait or stop and abandon the pipeline execution.


Stopped
The stopping process is complete, and the pipeline execution is stopped.


Succeeded
The pipeline execution was completed successfully.


Superseded
While this pipeline execution was waiting for the next stage to be completed, a newer pipeline execution advanced and continued through the pipeline instead.


Failed
The pipeline execution was not completed successfully.



Stage-level states 



Stage state
Description




InProgress
The stage is currently running.


Stopping
The stage execution is stopping due to a request to either stop and wait or stop and abandon the pipeline execution.


Stopped
The stopping process is complete, and the stage execution is stopped.


Succeeded
The stage was completed successfully.


Failed
The stage was not completed successfully.



Action-level states 



Action state
Description




InProgress
The action is currently running.


Abandoned
The action is abandoned due to a request to stop and abandon the pipeline execution.


Succeeded
The action was completed successfully.


Failed
For approval actions, the FAILED state means the action was either rejected by the reviewer or failed due to an incorrect action configuration.



View pipeline execution source revisions (console)
You can view details about source artifacts (output artifact that originated in the first stage of a pipeline) that are used in an execution of a pipeline. The details include identifiers, such as commit IDs, check-in comments, and, when you use the CLI, version numbers of pipeline build actions. For some revision types, you can view and open the URL of the commit. Source revisions are made up of the following:
 Summary: Summary information about the most recent revision of the artifact. For GitHub and AWS CodeCommit repositories, the commit message. For Amazon S3 buckets or actions, the user-provided content of a codepipeline-artifact-revision-summary key specified in the object metadata. 
 revisionUrl: The revision URL for the artifact revision (for example, the external repository URL). 
 revisionId: The revision ID for the artifact revision. For example, for a source change in a CodeCommit or GitHub repository, this is the commit ID. For artifacts stored in GitHub or CodeCommit repositories, the commit ID is linked to a commit details page. 

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodePipeline console at http://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home.

The names of all pipelines associated with your AWS account will be displayed. 


Choose the name of the pipeline for which you want to view source revision details, Do one of the following: 
    Choose View history. In Source revisions, the source change for each execution is listed.

    Locate an action for which you want to view source revision details, and then find the revision information at the bottom of its stage: 

Choose View current revisions to view source information. With the exception of artifacts stored in Amazon S3 buckets, identifiers such as commit IDs in this information detail view are linked to source information pages for the artifacts. 



View action executions (console)
You can view action details for a pipeline, such as action execution ID, input artifacts, output artifacts, and status. You can view action details by choosing a pipeline in the console and then choosing an execution ID.
Note
Detailed execution history is available for executions run on or after February 21, 2019.
