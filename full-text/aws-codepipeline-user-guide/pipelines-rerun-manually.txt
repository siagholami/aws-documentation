Start a pipeline manually in AWS CodePipeline
By default, a pipeline starts automatically when it is created and any time a change is made in a source repository. However, you might want to rerun the most recent revision through the pipeline a second time. You can use the CodePipeline console or the AWS CLI and start-pipeline-execution command to manually rerun the most recent revision through your pipeline.

To manually start a pipeline and run the most recent revision through a pipeline


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodePipeline console at http://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/home.


In Name, choose the name of the pipeline you want to start. 


On the pipeline details page, choose Release change. This starts the most recent revision available in each source location specified in a source action through the pipeline.


Start a pipeline manually (CLI)
To manually start a pipeline and run the most recent version of an artifact through a pipeline

Open a terminal (Linux, macOS, or Unix) or command prompt (Windows) and use the AWS CLI to run the start-pipeline-execution command, specifying the name of the pipeline you want to start. For example, to start running the last change through a pipeline named MyFirstPipeline: 

aws codepipeline start-pipeline-execution --name MyFirstPipeline

To verify success, view the returned object. This command returns an execution ID, similar to the following:

{
       "pipelineExecutionId": "c53dbd42-This-Is-An-Example"
   }
Note
After you have started the pipeline, you can monitor its progress in the CodePipeline console or by running the get-pipeline-state command. For more information, see View pipeline details and history (console) and View pipeline details and history (CLI).
