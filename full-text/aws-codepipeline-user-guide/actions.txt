Working with actions in CodePipeline
In AWS CodePipeline, an action is part of the sequence in a stage of a pipeline. It is a task performed on the artifact in that stage. Pipeline actions occur in a specified order, in sequence or in parallel, as determined in the configuration of the stage.
CodePipeline provides support for six types of actions:
 Source 
 Build 
 Test 
 Deploy 
 Approval 
 Invoke 
For information about the AWS services and partner products and services you can integrate into your pipeline based on action type, see Integrations with CodePipeline action types.
