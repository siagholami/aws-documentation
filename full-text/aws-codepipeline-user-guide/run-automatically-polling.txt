Use periodic checks to start a pipeline
Pipelines start automatically when repository changes are detected. One change detection method is periodic checks. Periodic checks can be enabled or disabled using the PollForSourceChanges flag. If you use the CLI to create or edit a pipeline, this parameter defaults to true. This is not the recommended configuration. Instead, edit your pipeline to use the recommended change-detection method and then set this parameter to false.
Note
Most source actions in CodePipeline, such as GitHub, require either a configured change detection resource (such as a webhook or CloudWatch Events rule) or use the option to poll the repository for source changes. For pipelines with a Bitbucket Cloud source action, you do not have to set up a webhook or default to polling. The connections action manages your source change detection for you. 
For more information about creating a pipeline with the recommended configuration, see Create a Pipeline (Console) and Create a Pipeline (CLI). For more information about updating an action or pipeline with the recommended configuration, see Edit a Pipeline (Console) and Edit a Pipeline (CLI).
