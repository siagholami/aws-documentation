Configure server-side encryption for artifacts stored in Amazon S3 for CodePipeline
There are two ways to configure server-side encryption for Amazon S3 artifacts:
 CodePipeline creates an S3 artifact bucket and default AWS managed SSE-KMS encryption keys when you create a pipeline using the Create Pipeline wizard. The master key is encrypted along with object data and managed by AWS.
 You can create and manage your own customer managed SSE-KMS keys.
Important
CodePipeline only supports symmetric customer master keys (CMKs). Do not use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt the data in your S3 bucket.
If you are using the default S3 key, you cannot change or delete this AWS managed key. If you are using a customer managed key in AWS KMS to encrypt or decrypt artifacts in the S3 bucket, you can change or rotate this key as necessary.
Amazon S3 supports bucket policies that you can use if you require server-side encryption for all objects that are stored in your bucket. For example, the following bucket policy denies upload object (s3:PutObject) permission to everyone if the request does not include the x-amz-server-side-encryption header requesting server-side encryption with SSE-KMS.

                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "DenyInsecureConnections",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::codepipeline-us-west-2-89050EXAMPLE/*",
            "Condition": {
                "Bool": {
                    "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

View your default Amazon S3 SSE-KMS encryption keys
When you use the Create Pipeline wizard to create your first pipeline, an S3 bucket is created for you in the same Region you created the pipeline. The bucket is used to store pipeline artifacts. When a pipeline runs, artifacts are put into and retrieved from the S3 bucket. By default, CodePipeline uses server-side encryption with the AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS) using the default key for Amazon S3 (the aws/s3 key). This key is created and stored in your AWS account. When artifacts are retrieved from the S3 bucket, CodePipeline uses the same SSE-KMS process to decrypt the artifact. 
To view information about your default AWS KMS key


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the service navigation pane, choose Encryption Keys. (If a welcome page appears, choose Get Started Now.)


In Filter, choose the Region for your pipeline. For example, if the pipeline was created in us-east-2, make sure that the filter is set to US East (Ohio).


For more information about the Regions and endpoints available for CodePipeline, see AWS CodePipeline endpoints and quotas.

In the list of encryption keys, choose the key with the alias used for your pipeline (by default, aws/s3). Basic information about the key is displayed.

Configure server-side encryption for S3 buckets using AWS CloudFormation or the AWS CLI
When you use AWS CloudFormation or the AWS CLI to create a pipeline, you must configure server-side encryption manually. Use the sample bucket policy above, and then create your own customer managed SSE-KMS encryption keys. You can also use your own keys instead of the default Amazon S3 key. Some advantages to using your own key include:
 You want to rotate the key on a schedule to meet business or security requirements for your organization.
 You want to create a pipeline that uses resources associated with another AWS account. This requires the use of a customer managed key. For more information, see Create a pipeline in CodePipeline that uses resources from another AWS account. 
Cryptographic best practices discourage extensive reuse of encryption keys. As a best practice, rotate your key on a regular basis. To create new cryptographic material for your AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMKs), you can create CMKs, and then change your applications or aliases to use the new CMKs. Or, you can enable automatic key rotation for an existing CMK. 
To rotate your SSE-KMS customer master key, see Rotating Customer Master Keys. 
Important
CodePipeline only supports symmetric customer master keys (CMKs). Do not use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt the data in your S3 bucket.
