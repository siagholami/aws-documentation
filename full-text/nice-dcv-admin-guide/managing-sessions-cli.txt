Using the Command Line Tool to Manage NICE DCV Sessions
The NICE DCV server includes a command line tool that can be used to start, stop, and view NICE DCV sessions.
Using the Command Line Tool on a Windows NICE DCV Server
To use the command line tool on a Windows NICE DCV server, you must run the commands from the NICE DCV installation directory or you must add the NICE DCV directory to the PATH environment variable. If you add the NICE DCV directory to the PATH environment variable, you can use the commands from any directory.
To use the command line tool from the NICE DCV installation directory
Navigate to the folder in which the dcv.exe file is located, C:\Program Files\NICE\DCV\Server\bin\ by default, and open a command prompt window.
Or you can specify the full path when running a command from a different directory. For example:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\NICE\DCV\Server\bin\dcv.exe" list-sessions
To add the NICE DCV directory to the PATH environment variable


In File Explorer, right-click This PC and choose Properties.


Choose Advanced system settings.


On the Advanced tab, choose Environment Variables.


In the System variables section, select the Path variable and choose Edit.


Choose New and specify the full path to the bin folder in the NICE DCV installation directory (for example, C:\Program Files\NICE\DCV\Server\bin\).


Choose OK and close the Environment Variables window.


Using the Command Line Tool on a Linux NICE DCV Server
On Linux NICE DCV servers, the command line tool is automatically configured in the $PATH environment variable. This enables you to use the command line tool from any folder. Open a terminal window and enter the command to run.
