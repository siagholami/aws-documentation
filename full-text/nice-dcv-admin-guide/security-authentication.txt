Configuring NICE DCV Authentication
By default, clients are required to authenticate against the server on which NICE DCV is hosted before connecting to a NICE DCV session. If the client fails to authenticate, it is prevented from connecting to the session. Client authentication requirements can be disabled to allow clients to connect to a session without authenticating against the server.
NICE DCV supports the following authentication methods:
 system — This is the default authentication method. Client authentication is delegated to the underlying operating system. For Windows NICE DCV servers, authentication is delegated to WinLogon. For Linux NICE DCV servers, authentication is delegated to PAM. Clients provide their system credentials when connecting to a NICE DCV session. Ensure that your clients have the credentials for the appropriate user accounts on the NICE DCV server.
 none — No client authentication is required when connecting to a NICE DCV session. The NICE DCV server automatically grants access to all clients attempting to connect to a session.
Make sure that your clients are aware of the authentication method used by the NICE DCV server and that they have the information required to connect to the session.

To change the NICE DCV server's authentication method, you must configure the authentication parameter using the Windows Registry Editor.
To change the authentication method on Windows


Open the Windows Registry Editor.


Navigate to the HKEY_USERS/S-1-5-18/Software/GSettings/com/nicesoftware/dcv/security/ key and select the authentication parameter.


If there is no authentication parameter in the registry key, create one:


In the left pane, open the context (right-click) menu for the authentication key and choose New, string value.


For Name, enter authentication and press Enter.


Open the authentication parameter. For Value data, enter either system or none.


Choose OK and close the Windows Registry Editor.


Windows Credentials Provider
Windows Credentials Provider enables users to bypass the Windows login if they successfully authenticate against the DCV server.
Windows Credentials Provider is only supported if the DCV authentication parameter is set to system. If the DCV authentication parameter is set to none, users must manually sign in to Windows after they have been automatically authenticated against the DCV server.
Windows Credentials Provider is enabled by default when you install the NICE DCV server.
To disable Windows Credentials Provider


Open the Windows Registry Editor.


Navigate to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\Credential Providers\{8A2C93D0-D55F-4045-99D7-B27F5E263407} key.


Choose Edit, New, DWORD Value.


For the name, enter Disabled.


Open the value. For Value data, enter 1 and choose OK.


Close the Windows Registry Editor.


To re-enable Windows Credentials Provider


Open the Windows Registry Editor.


Navigate to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\Credential Providers\{8A2C93D0-D55F-4045-99D7-B27F5E263407} key.


Open the Disabled value. For Value data, enter 0 and choose OK.


Close the Windows Registry Editor.


Configuring Authentication on Linux
To change the NICE DCV server's authentication method, you must configure the authentication parameter in the dcv.conf file.
To change the authentication method on Linux


Navigate to /etc/dcv/ and open the dcv.conf with your preferred text editor.


Locate the authentication parameter in the [security] section, and replace the existing value with either system or none.


If there is no authentication parameter in the [security] section, add it manually using the following format:
[security] 
   authentication=method

Save and close the file.
