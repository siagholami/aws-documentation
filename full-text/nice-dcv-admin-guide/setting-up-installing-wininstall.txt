Installing the NICE DCV Server on Windows
You can use an installation wizard to install the NICE DCV server on a Windows host server. The wizard walks you through a series of steps that let you customize your NICE DCV server installation. Or, you can use the command line to perform an unattended installation, which uses default settings to automate the installation procedure.
Note
The NICE DCV server installer is signed by an SHA-256 certificate. If you are using a server running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2, you must install a Microsoft security update to support this certificate type. For more information, see Microsoft Security Advisory 3033929 and Microsoft Windows Support.

(Optional) To manually configure your server's firewall to allow communication over the required port, select No, I will manually configure my firewall later.


(Optional) To manually start the NICE DCV server after the installation, select No, I want to start a DCV Service manually. If you select this option, you can't start a console session automatically after the installation is complete. If you select this option, step 9 is skipped.


Choose Next.


On the DCV Session Management Configuration screen, specify the owner for the automatic console session. Or, to prevent the automatic console session from starting after the installation is complete, select No, I will create the session manually.

Unattended Installation
The unattended installation does the following by default:

 Creates an automatic console session.
 Sets the console session owner to the user who performs the installation.
You can override the default actions by appending the following options to the installation command:
