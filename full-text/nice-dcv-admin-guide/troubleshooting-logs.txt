Using the Log Files
The NICE DCV log files can be used to identify and troubleshoot problems with your NICE DCV server. The NICE DCV log files can be found in the following location on your NICE DCV server:
 Windows server
C:\ProgramData\NICE\dcv\log\
Note
The ProgramData folder might be hidden by default. If you do not see the ProgramData folder, set your file browser to show hidden items. Alternatively, enter %programdata% in the address bar and press Enter.
 Linux server
/var/log/dcv/
The NICE DCV server enables you to configure the verbosity level of the log files. The following verbosity levels are available:
 error — Provides the least detail. Includes errors only.
 warning — Includes errors and warnings.
 info — The default verbosity level. Includes errors, warnings, and information messages.
 debug — Provides the most detail. Provides detailed information that is useful for debugging issues.
