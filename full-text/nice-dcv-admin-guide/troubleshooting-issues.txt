Cursor Issues on a Windows NICE DCV Server
With NICE DCV servers running on Windows Server 2012 or Windows 8 and later, the mouse cursor always appears as an arrow. This happens even when pausing on text entry fields or single-click navigation items. This could happen if there is no physical mouse attached to the server, or if there is no mouse device listed in Device Manager.
To resolve the issue


Open Control Panel, and choose Ease of Access Center.


Choose Make the mouse easier to use.


Select Turn on Mouse Keys. 


Choose Apply, OK.
