Managing NICE DCV Session Storage
Session storage is a directory on the NICE DCV server that clients can access when they are connected to a NICE DCV session.
If session storage has been enabled on the NICE DCV server, you can use the dcv set-storage-root command to specify the directory to be used for session storage. For more information about enabling session storage on the NICE DCV server, see Enabling Session Storage.
To set the session storage path
Use the dcv set-storage-root command and specify the session ID and the path to the directory to use.
dcv set-storage-root --session session_id path/to/directory
You can use %home% to specify the home directory of the user who is currently signed in. For example, the %home%/storage/ path resolves to c:\Users\username\storage\ on Windows servers. It resolves to $HOME/storage/ on Linux servers.
