Enabling Session Storage
Session storage is a folder on the NICE DCV server that clients can access when they are connected to a specific NICE DCV session. When you enable session storage for a session, clients can download files from, and upload files to, the specified folder. This feature enables clients to share files while connected to a session.

Enabling Session Storage on a Windows NICE DCV Server
To enable session storage, first create the folder to use for session storage. Then, configure the storage-root parameter using the Windows Registry Editor.
To enable session storage on Windows


Create the folder to use for session storage (for example, c:\session-storage).


Configure the storage-root parameter.


Open the Windows Registry Editor.


Navigate to the HKEY_USERS/S-1-5-18/Software/GSettings/com/nicesoftware/dcv/session-management/automatic-console-session key and select the storage-root parameter.
If there is no storage-root parameter in the registry key, create one as follows:


In the left pane, open the context (right-click) menu for the session-management/automatic-console-session key and choose New, String.


For Name, enter storage-root and press Enter.




Open the storage-root parameter. For Value data, enter the full path to the folder created in step 1.
You can also use %home% in the path to specify the home directory of the user who is currently signed in. For example, the following path uses c:\Users\username\storage\ as the session storage directory.
%home%/storage/
Note
If the specified subdirectory does not exist, then session storage is disabled.


Choose OK and close the Windows Registry Editor.


Stop and restart the NICE DCV server.


Start the session and specify the --storage-root option. For more information, see Starting NICE DCV Sessions.


Enabling Session Storage on a Linux NICE DCV Server
To enable session storage, you must create the folder to use for session storage and then configure the storage-root parameter in the dcv.conf file.
To enable session storage on Linux


Create the folder to use for session storage (for example, /opt/session-storage/).


Configure the storage-root parameter.


Navigate to /etc/dcv/ and open the dcv.conf with your preferred text editor.


Locate the storage-root parameter in the [session-management/automatic-console-session] section. Replace the existing path with the full path to the folder that you created in step 1.
If there is no storage-root parameter in the [session-management/automatic-console-session] section, add it manually using the following format.
[session-management/automatic-console-session]
  storage-root="/opt/session-storage/"
You can also use %home% in the path to specify the home directory of the user who is currently signed in. For example, the following parameter uses the $HOME/storage/ directory for session storage.
[session-management/automatic-console-session]
  storage-root="%home%/storage/"
Note
If the specified subdirectory does not exist, then session storage is disabled.


Save and close the file.


Stop and restart the NICE DCV server.


Start the session and specify the --storage-root option. For more information, see Starting NICE DCV Sessions.
