Disconnecting Idle Clients
You can configure NICE DCV to disconnect idle clients that have not sent any keyboard or pointer input to the NICE DCV server for a specified period. By default, the NICE DCV server disconnects NICE DCV clients that have been idle for a period of 60 minutes.
You can also configure the NICE DCV server to send a notification to idle clients to inform them that their session is about to disconnect. Timeout notifications are supported only with NICE DCV servers and clients version 2017.4 and later.
You can use the following procedures to specify a custom idle timeout period.

Changing the Idle Timeout Period on Windows
To change the NICE DCV server's idle timeout period, you must configure the idle-timeout parameter using the Windows Registry Editor.
To change the idle timeout period on Windows


Open the Windows Registry Editor.


Navigate to the HKEY_USERS/S-1-5-18/Software/GSettings/com/nicesoftware/dcv/connectivity/ key and select the idle-timeout parameter.


If the parameter does not exist, use the following steps to create it:


In the left pane, open the context (right-click) menu for the connectivity key, and choose New, DWORD (32-bit) value.


For Name, enter idle-timeout and press Enter.


Open the idle-timeout parameter. For Value data, enter a value for the idle timeout period (in minutes). To avoid disconnecting idle clients, enter 0.


Choose OK and close the Windows Registry Editor.


(Optional) To configure the NICE DCV server to send timeout notifications to idle clients

Navigate to the HKEY_USERS/S-1-5-18/Software/GSettings/com/nicesoftware/dcv/connectivity/ key and select the idle-timeout-warning parameter.

If the parameter does not exist, use the following steps to create it:


In the left pane, open the context (right-click) menu for the connectivity key and choose New, DWORD (32-bit) value.


For Name, enter idle-timeout-warning and press Enter.


Open the idle-timeout-warning parameter. For Value data, enter (in seconds) the amount of time before idle timeout disconnection that the notification should be sent. For example, if you want the notification to be sent two minutes before the idle timeout is reached, enter 120.


Choose OK and close the Windows Registry Editor.


Changing the Idle Timeout Period on Linux
To change the NICE DCV server's idle timeout period, you must configure the idle-timeout parameter in the dcv.conf file.
To change the idle timeout period on Linux


Open /etc/dcv/dcv.conf with your preferred text editor.


Locate the idle-timeout parameter in the [connectivity] section and replace the existing timeout period with the new timeout period (in minutes).


If there is no idle-timeout parameter in the [connectivity] section, add it manually using the following format:
[connectivity]
   idle-timeout=timeout_in_minutes
To avoid disconnecting idle clients, enter 0.

(Optional) To configure the NICE DCV server to send timeout notifications to idle clients, add the idle-timeout-warning parameter to the [connectivity] section and specify (in seconds) the amount of time before idle timeout disconnection that the notification should be sent.

idle-timeout-warning=seconds_before_idle_timeout
For example, if you want the notification to be sent two minutes before the idle timeout is reached, specify 120.

Save and close the file.
