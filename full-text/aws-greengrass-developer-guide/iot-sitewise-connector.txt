IoT SiteWise connector
The IoT SiteWise connector sends local device and equipment data to asset properties in AWS IoT SiteWise. You can use this connector to collect data from multiple OPC-UA servers and publish it to AWS IoT SiteWise. The connector sends the data to asset properties in the current AWS account and Region.
Note
AWS IoT SiteWise is a fully managed service that collects, processes, and visualizes data from industrial devices and equipment. You can configure asset properties that process raw data sent from this connector to your assets' measurement properties. For example, you can define a transform property that converts a device's Celsius temperature data points to Fahrenheit, or you can define a metric property that calculates the average hourly temperature. For more information, see What is AWS IoT SiteWise? in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide.
The connector sends data to AWS IoT SiteWise with the OPC-UA data stream paths sent from the OPC-UA servers. For example, the data stream path /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature might represent the temperature sensor of turbine #7 at wind farm #3. If the AWS IoT Greengrass core loses connection to the internet, the connector caches data until it can successfully connect to the AWS Cloud. You can configure the maximum disk buffer size used for caching data. If the cache size exceeds the maximum disk buffer size, the connector discards the oldest data from the queue.
After you configure and deploy the IoT SiteWise connector, you can add a gateway and OPC-UA sources in the AWS IoT SiteWise console. When you configure a source in the console, you can filter or prefix the OPC-UA data stream paths sent by the IoT SiteWise connector. For instructions to finish setting up your gateway and sources, see Adding the gateway in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide.
AWS IoT SiteWise receives data only from data streams that you have mapped to the measurement properties of AWS IoT SiteWise assets. To map data streams to asset properties, you can set a property's alias to be equivalent to an OPC-UA data stream path. To learn about defining asset models and creating assets, see Modeling industrial assets in the AWS IoT SiteWise User Guide.
Notes
You can use stream manager to upload data to AWS IoT SiteWise from sources other than OPC-UA servers. Stream manager also provides customizable support for persistence and bandwidth management. For more information, see Manage data streams on the AWS IoT Greengrass core.
This connector runs in No container isolation mode, so you can deploy it to a Greengrass group running in a Docker container.
