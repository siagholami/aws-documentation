What is AWS IoT Greengrass?
AWS IoT Greengrass is software that extends cloud capabilities to local devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with AWS IoT Core and export IoT data to the AWS Cloud. AWS IoT Greengrass developers can use AWS Lambda functions and prebuilt connectors to create serverless applications that are deployed to devices for local execution.
The following diagram shows the basic architecture of AWS IoT Greengrass.

AWS IoT Greengrass makes it possible for customers to build IoT devices and application logic. Specifically, AWS IoT Greengrass provides cloud-based management of application logic that runs on devices. Locally deployed Lambda functions and connectors are triggered by local events, messages from the cloud, or other sources.
In AWS IoT Greengrass, devices securely communicate on a local network and exchange messages with each other without having to connect to the cloud. AWS IoT Greengrass provides a local pub/sub message manager that can intelligently buffer messages if connectivity is lost so that inbound and outbound messages to the cloud are preserved.
AWS IoT Greengrass protects user data:
 Through the secure authentication and authorization of devices.
 Through secure connectivity in the local network.
 Between local devices and the cloud.
Device security credentials function in a group until they are revoked, even if connectivity to the cloud is disrupted, so that the devices can continue to securely communicate locally.
AWS IoT Greengrass provides secure, over-the-air updates of Lambda functions.

AWS IoT Greengrass groups
A Greengrass group is a collection of settings and components, such as a Greengrass core, devices, and subscriptions. Groups are used to define a scope of interaction. For example, a group might represent one floor of a building, one truck, or an entire mining site. The following diagram shows the components that can make up a Greengrass group.

In the preceding diagram:
A: Greengrass group definition
Information about group settings and components.
B: Greengrass group settings
These include:
 Greengrass group role.
 Certificate authority and local connection configuration.
 Greengrass core connectivity information.
 Default Lambda runtime environment. For more information, see Setting default containerization for Lambda functions in a group.
 CloudWatch and local logs configuration. For more information, see Monitoring with AWS IoT Greengrass logs.
C: Greengrass core
The AWS IoT thing (device) that represents the Greengrass core. For more information, see Configure the AWS IoT Greengrass core.
D: Lambda function definition
A list of Lambda functions that run locally on the core, with associated configuration data. For more information, see Run Lambda functions on the AWS IoT Greengrass core.
E: Subscription definition
A list of subscriptions that enable communication using MQTT messages. A subscription defines:
 A message source and message target. These can be devices, Lambda functions, connectors, AWS IoT Core, and the local shadow service.
 A topic or subject that's used to filter messages.
For more information, see Managed subscriptions in the MQTT messaging workflow.
F: Connector definition
A list of connectors that run locally on the core, with associated configuration data. For more information, see Integrate with services and protocols using Greengrass connectors.
G: Device definition
A list of AWS IoT things (devices) that are members of the Greengrass group, with associated configuration data. For more information, see Devices in AWS IoT Greengrass.
H: Resource definition
A list of local resources, machine learning resources, and secret resources on the Greengrass core, with associated configuration data. For more information, see Access local resources with Lambda functions and connectors, Perform machine learning inference, and Deploy secrets to the AWS IoT Greengrass core.
When deployed, the Greengrass group definition, Lambda functions, connectors, resources, and subscription table are copied to the core device. For more information, see Deploy AWS IoT Greengrass groups to an AWS IoT Greengrass core.
Devices in AWS IoT Greengrass
A Greengrass group can contain two types of AWS IoT device:
Greengrass core
A Greengrass core is a device that runs the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software, which allows it to communicate directly with AWS IoT Core and the AWS IoT Greengrass service. A core has its own device certificate used for authenticating with AWS IoT Core. It has a device shadow and an entry in the AWS IoT Core registry. Greengrass cores run a local Lambda runtime, deployment agent, and IP address tracker that sends IP address information to the AWS IoT Greengrass service to allow Greengrass devices to automatically discover their group and core connection information. For more information, see Configure the AWS IoT Greengrass core.
A Greengrass group must contain exactly one core.
Device connected to a Greengrass core  
Connected devices (also called Greengrass devices) also have their own device certificate for AWS IoT Core authentication, a device shadow, and an entry in the AWS IoT Core registry. Greengrass devices can run FreeRTOS or use the AWS IoT Device SDK or  AWS IoT Greengrass Discovery API to get discovery information used to connect and authenticate with the core in the same Greengrass group. To learn how to use the AWS IoT console to create and configure a device for AWS IoT Greengrass, see Module 4: Interacting with devices in an AWS IoT Greengrass group. Or, for examples that show you how to use the AWS CLI to create and configure a device for AWS IoT Greengrass, see create-device-definition in the AWS CLI Command Reference.
In a Greengrass group, you can create subscriptions that allow devices to communicate over MQTT with Lambda functions, connectors, and other devices in the group, and with AWS IoT Core or the local shadow service. MQTT messages are routed through the core. If the core device loses connectivity to the cloud, devices can continue to communicate over the local network. Devices can vary in size, from smaller microcontroller-based devices to large appliances. Currently, a Greengrass group can contain up to 2500 devices. A device can be a member of up to 10 groups.
OPC-UA is an information exchange standard for industrial communication. To implement support for OPC-UA on the Greengrass core, you can use the IoT SiteWise connector. The connector sends industrial device data from OPC-UA servers to asset properties in AWS IoT SiteWise.
The following table shows how these device types are related.

The AWS IoT Greengrass core device stores certificates in two locations:
 Core device certificate in /greengrass-root/certs. Typically, the core device certificate is named hash.cert.pem (for example, 86c84488a5.cert.pem). This certificate is used by the AWS IoT client for mutual authentication when the core connects to the AWS IoT Core and AWS IoT Greengrass services.
 MQTT server certificate in /greengrass-root/ggc/var/state/server. The MQTT server certificate is named server.crt. This certificate is used for mutual authentication between the local MQTT server (on the Greengrass core) and Greengrass devices.
Note
greengrass-root represents the path where the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software is installed on your device. Typically, this is the /greengrass directory.
SDKs
The following AWS-provided SDKs are used to work with AWS IoT Greengrass:
AWS SDK
Use the AWS SDK to build applications that interact with any AWS service, including Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS IoT, AWS IoT Greengrass, and more. In the context of AWS IoT Greengrass, you can use the AWS SDK in deployed Lambda functions to make direct calls to any AWS service. For more information, see AWS SDKs.
The operations specific to Greengrass that are available in the AWS SDKs are also available in the AWS IoT Greengrass API and AWS CLI.
AWS IoT Device SDK  
The AWS IoT Device SDK helps devices connect to AWS IoT Core and AWS IoT Greengrass. For more information, see AWS IoT Device SDKs in the AWS IoT Developer Guide.
Devices can use any of the AWS IoT Device SDK v2 platforms to discover connectivity information for a Greengrass core. Connectivity information includes:  
 The IDs of the Greengrass groups that the device belongs to.
 The IP addresses of the Greengrass core in each group. These are also called core endpoints.
 The group CA certificate, which devices use for mutual authentication with the core. For more information, see Device connection workflow.
In v1 of the AWS IoT Device SDKs, only the C and Python platforms provide built-in discovery support.
AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK
The AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK enables Lambda functions to interact with the Greengrass core, publish messages to AWS IoT, interact with the local shadow service, invoke other deployed Lambda functions, and access secret resources. This SDK is used by Lambda functions that run on an AWS IoT Greengrass core. For more information, see AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK.
AWS IoT Greengrass Machine Learning SDK
The AWS IoT Greengrass Machine Learning SDK enables Lambda functions to consume machine learning models that are deployed to the Greengrass core as machine learning resources. This SDK is used by Lambda functions that run on an AWS IoT Greengrass core and interact with a local inference service. For more information, see AWS IoT Greengrass Machine Learning SDK.

[  v1.9  ]
New features in v1.9:
 Support for Python 3.7 and Node.js 8.10 Lambda runtimes. Lambda functions that use Python 3.7 and Node.js 8.10 runtimes can now run on an AWS IoT Greengrass core. (AWS IoT Greengrass continues to support the Python 2.7 and Node.js 6.10 runtimes.)
 Optimized MQTT connections. The Greengrass core establishes fewer connections with the AWS IoT Core. This change can reduce operational costs for charges that are based on the number of connections.
 Elliptic Curve (EC) key for the local MQTT server. The local MQTT server supports EC keys in addition to RSA keys. (The MQTT server certificate has an SHA-256 RSA signature, regardless of the key type.) For more information, see AWS IoT Greengrass core security principals.
 Support for OpenWrt. AWS IoT Greengrass Core software v1.9.2 or later can be installed on OpenWrt distributions with Armv8 (AArch64) and Armv7l architectures. Currently, OpenWrt does not support ML inference.
 Support for Armv6l. AWS IoT Greengrass Core software v1.9.3 or later can be installed on Raspbian distributions on Armv6l architectures (for example, on Raspberry Pi Zero devices).
 OTA updates on port 443 with ALPN. Greengrass cores that use port 443 for MQTT traffic now support over-the-air (OTA) software updates. AWS IoT Greengrass uses the Application Layer Protocol Network (ALPN) TLS extension to enable these connections. For more information, see OTA updates of AWS IoT Greengrass Core software and Connect on port 443 or through a network proxy.

[  v1.8  ]

New features:
Configurable default access identity for Lambda functions in the group. This group-level setting determines the default permissions that are used to run Lambda functions. You can set the user ID, group ID, or both. Individual Lambda functions can override the default access identity of their group. For more information, see Setting the default access identity for Lambda functions in a group.
HTTPS traffic over port 443. HTTPS communication can be configured to travel over port 443 instead of the default port 8443. This complements AWS IoT Greengrass support for the Application Layer Protocol Network (ALPN) TLS extension and allows all Greengrass messaging traffic—both MQTT and HTTPS—to use port 443. For more information, see Connect on port 443 or through a network proxy.
Predictably named client IDs for AWS IoT connections. This change enables support for AWS IoT Device Defender and AWS IoT lifecycle events, so you can receive notifications for connect, disconnect, subscribe, and unsubscribe events. Predictable naming also makes it easier to create logic around connection IDs (for example, to create subscribe policy templates based on certificate attributes). For more information, see Client IDs for MQTT connections with AWS IoT.

Bug fixes and improvements:
   Fixed an issue with shadow synchronization and device certificate manager reconnection.
   General performance improvements and bug fixes.
