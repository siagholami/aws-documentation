Greengrass group role
The Greengrass group role is an IAM role that authorizes code running on a Greengrass core to access your AWS resources. You create the role and manage permissions in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and attach the role to your Greengrass group. A Greengrass group has one group role. To add or change permissions, you can attach a different role or change the IAM policies that are attached to the role.
The role must define AWS IoT Greengrass as a trusted entity. Depending on your business case, the group role might contain IAM policies that define:
 Permissions for user-defined Lambda functions to access AWS services.
 Permissions for connectors to access AWS services.
 Permissions for stream manager to export streams to AWS IoT Analytics and Kinesis Data Streams.
 Permissions to allow CloudWatch logging.
The following sections describe how to attach or detach a Greengrass group role in the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
 Manage the group role (console)
 Manage the group role (CLI)
Note
In addition to the group role that authorizes access from the Greengrass core, you can assign a Greengrass service role that allows AWS IoT Greengrass to access AWS resources on your behalf.
Managing the Greengrass group role (console)
You can use the AWS IoT console for the following role management tasks:
 Find your Greengrass group role
 Add or change the Greengrass group role
 Remove the Greengrass group role
Note
The user who is signed in to the console must have permissions to manage the role.
Find your Greengrass group role (console)
Follow these steps to find the role that is attched to a Greengrass group.


In the AWS IoT console, choose Greengrass, and then choose Groups.


Choose the target group.


On the group configuration page, choose Settings.



If a role is attached to the group, it appears under Group Role.
Add or change the Greengrass group role (console)
Follow these steps to choose an IAM role from your AWS account to add to a Greengrass group.
A group role has the following requirements:
 AWS IoT Greengrass defined as a trusted entity.
 The permission policies attached to the role must grant the permissions to your AWS resources that are required by the Lambda functions and connectors in the group, and by Greengrass system components.
Use the IAM console to create and configure the role and its permissions. For steps that create an example role that allows access to an Amazon DynamoDB table, see Configure the group role. For general steps, see Creating a role for an AWS service (console) in the IAM User Guide.
After the role is configured, use the AWS IoT console to add the role to the group.
Note
This procedure is required only to choose a role for the group. It's not required after changing the permissions of the currently selected group role.


In the AWS IoT console, choose Greengrass, and then choose Groups.


Choose the target group.


On the group configuration page, choose Settings.



Under Group Role, choose to add or change the role:
    To add the role, choose Add Role.
    To choose a different role, choose the ellipses (…) for the role, and then choose Edit IAM Role.


On the Your Group's IAM Role page, choose the target role from your list of roles, and then choose Save. These are the roles in your AWS account that define AWS IoT Greengrass as a trusted entity.


Remove the Greengrass group role (console)
Follow these steps to detach the role from a Greengrass group.


In the AWS IoT console, choose Greengrass, and then choose Groups.


Choose the target group.


On the group configuration page, choose Settings.



Under Group Role, choose the ellipses (…) for the role, and then choose Remove IAM Role.


This step removes the role from the group but doesn't delete the role. If you want to delete the role, use the IAM console.
Managing the Greengrass group role (CLI)
You can use the AWS CLI for the following role management tasks:
 Get your Greengrass group role
 Create the Greengrass group role
 Remove the Greengrass group role
Get the Greengrass group role (CLI)
Follow these steps to find out if a Greengrass group has an associated role.

Get the ID of the target group from the list of your groups.

aws greengrass list-groups
The following is an example list-groups response. Each group in the response includes an Id property that contains the group ID.
{
       "Groups": [
           {
               "LatestVersionArn": "arn:aws:us-west-2:123456789012:/greengrass/groups/00dedaaa-ac16-484d-ad77-c3eedEXAMPLE/versions/4cbc3f07-fc5e-48c4-a50e-7d356EXAMPLE",

           },
           ...
       ]
   }
For more information, including examples that use the query option to filter results, see Getting the group ID.


Copy the Id of the target group from the output.


Get the group role. Replace group-id with the ID of the target group.


aws greengrass get-associated-role --group-id group-id
If a role is associated with your Greengrass group, the following role metadata is returned.
{
     "AssociatedAt": "timestamp",
     "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/path/role-name"
   }
If your group doesn't have an associated role, the following error is returned.
An error occurred (404) when calling the GetAssociatedRole operation: You need to attach an IAM role to this deployment group.
Create the Greengrass group role (CLI)
Follow these steps to create a role and associate it with a Greengrass group.
To create the group role using IAM

Create the role with a trust policy that allows AWS IoT Greengrass to assume the role. This example creates a role named MyGreengrassGroupRole, but you can use a different name.


[ Linux, macOS, or Unix ]
aws iam create-role --role-name MyGreengrassGroupRole --assume-role-policy-document '{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "Service": "greengrass.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }'

[ Windows command prompt ]
aws iam create-role --role-name MyGreengrassGroupRole --assume-role-policy-document "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"greengrass.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"}]}"



Copy the role ARN from the role metadata in the output. You use the ARN to associate the role with your group.


Attach managed or inline policies to the role to support your business case. For example, if a user-defined Lambda function reads from Amazon S3, you might attach the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess managed policy to the role.


aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name MyGreengrassGroupRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
If successful, no response is returned.
To associate the role with your Greengrass group

Get the ID of the target group from the list of your groups.

aws greengrass list-groups
The following is an example list-groups response. Each group in the response includes an Id property that contains the group ID.
