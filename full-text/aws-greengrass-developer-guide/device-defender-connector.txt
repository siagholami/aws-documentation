Device Defender connector
The Device Defender connector notifies administrators of changes in the state of a Greengrass core device. This can help identify unusual behavior that might indicate a compromised device.
This connector reads system metrics from the /proc directory on the core device, and then publishes the metrics to AWS IoT Device Defender. For metrics reporting details, see Device metrics document specification in the AWS IoT Developer Guide.
This connector has the following versions.

Requirements
This connector has the following requirements:

[ Version 3 ]

AWS IoT Greengrass Core software v1.9.3 or later.
Python version 3.7 installed on the core device and added to the PATH environment variable.

Create Connector Example (AWS CLI)
The following CLI command creates a ConnectorDefinition with an initial version that contains the Device Defender connector.
aws greengrass create-connector-definition --name MyGreengrassConnectors --initial-version '{
    "Connectors": [
        {
            "Id": "MyDeviceDefenderConnector",
            "ConnectorArn": "arn:aws:greengrass:region::/connectors/DeviceDefender/versions/3",
            "Parameters": {
                "SampleIntervalSeconds": "600",
                "ProcDestinationPath": "/host_proc",
                "ProcDestinationPath-ResourceId": "my-proc-resource"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
Note
The Lambda function in this connector has a long-lived lifecycle.
In the AWS IoT Greengrass console, you can add a connector from the group's Connectors page. For more information, see Getting started with Greengrass connectors (console).
Input data
This connector doesn't accept MQTT messages as input data.
Output data
This connector publishes security metrics to AWS IoT Device Defender as output data.
Topic filter in subscription
$aws/things//defender/metrics/json
This is the topic syntax that AWS IoT Device Defender expects. The connector replaces the  wildcard with the device name (for example, $aws/things/thing-name/defender/metrics/json).
Example output
For metrics reporting details, see  Device metrics document specification in the AWS IoT Developer Guide.
