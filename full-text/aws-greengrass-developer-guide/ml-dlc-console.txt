How to configure optimized machine learning inference using the AWS Management Console
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you must be using AWS IoT Greengrass Core v1.10 or later.
You can use the SageMaker Neo deep learning compiler to optimize the prediction efficiency of native machine learning inference models in Tensorflow, Apache MXNet, PyTorch, ONNX, and XGBoost frameworks for a smaller footprint and faster performance. You can then download the optimized model and install the SageMaker Neo deep learning runtime and deploy them to your AWS IoT Greengrass devices for faster inference. 
This tutorial describes how to use the AWS Management Console to configure a Greengrass group to run a Lambda inference example that recognizes images from a camera locally, without sending data to the cloud. The inference example accesses the camera module on a Raspberry Pi. In this tutorial, you download a prepackaged model that is trained by Resnet-50 and optimized in the Neo deep learning compiler. You then use the model to perform local image classification on your AWS IoT Greengrass device. 
The tutorial contains the following high-level steps:


Configure the Raspberry Pi


Install the Neo deep learning runtime


Create an inference Lambda function


Add the Lambda function to the group


Add a Neo-optimized model resource to the group


Add your camera device resource to the group


Add subscriptions to the group


Deploy the group


Test the example


Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need: 
  Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, or Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B, set up and configured for use with AWS IoT Greengrass. To set up your Raspberry Pi with AWS IoT Greengrass, run the Greengrass Device Setup script, or make sure that you have completed Module 1 and Module 2 of Getting started with AWS IoT Greengrass. 
Note
The Raspberry Pi might require a 2.5A power supply to run the deep learning frameworks that are typically used for image classification. A power supply with a lower rating might cause the device to reboot.
  Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 - 8 megapixel, 1080p. To learn how to set up the camera, see Connecting the camera in the Raspberry Pi documentation. 
  A Greengrass group and a Greengrass core. To learn how to create a Greengrass group or core, see Getting started with AWS IoT Greengrass. 
Note
 This tutorial uses a Raspberry Pi, but AWS IoT Greengrass supports other platforms, such as Intel Atom and NVIDIA Jetson TX2. If using the Intel Atom example, you might need to install Python 3.6 instead of Python 3.7. For information about configuring your device so you can install the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software, see Setting up other devices. 
For third party platforms that AWS IoT Greengrass does not support, you must run your Lambda function in non-containerized mode. To run in non-containerized mode, you must run your Lambda function as root. For more information, see Considerations when choosing Lambda function containerization and Setting the default access identity for Lambda functions in a group.
Step 1: Configure the Raspberry Pi
In this step, install updates to the Raspbian operating system, install the camera module software and Python dependencies, and enable the camera interface. 
Run the following commands in your Raspberry Pi terminal.

Install updates to Raspbian.

sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Install the picamera interface for the camera module and other Python libraries that are required for this tutorial.

sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-setuptools python3-pip python3-picamera
Validate the installation:
    Make sure that your Python 3.7 installation includes pip.
 ```
 python3 -m pip
 ```

 If pip isn't installed, download it from the [pip website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and then run the following command\.

 ```
 python3 get-pip.py
 ```



Make sure that your Python version is 3.7 or higher.
python3 --version
If the output lists an earlier version, run the following command.
sudo apt-get install -y python3.7-dev
    Make sure that Setuptools and Picamera installed successfully.
sudo -u ggc_user bash -c 'python3 -c "import setuptools"'
 sudo -u ggc_user bash -c 'python3 -c "import picamera"'
If the output doesn't contain errors, the validation is successful.
Note
If the Python executable installed on your device is python3.7, use python3.7 instead of python3 for the commands in this tutorial. Make sure that your pip installation maps to the correct python3.7 or python3 version to avoid dependency errors.



Reboot the Raspberry Pi.

sudo reboot

Open the Raspberry Pi configuration tool.

sudo raspi-config


Use the arrow keys to open Interfacing Options and enable the camera interface. If prompted, allow the device to reboot.


Use the following command to test the camera setup.


raspistill -v -o test.jpg
This opens a preview window on the Raspberry Pi, saves a picture named test.jpg to your current directory, and displays information about the camera in the Raspberry Pi terminal.
Step 2: Install the Amazon SageMaker Neo deep learning runtime
In this step, install the Neo deep learning runtime (DLR) on your Raspberry Pi. 
Note
We recommend installing version 1.1.0 for this tutorial.

Sign in to your Raspberry Pi remotely.

ssh pi@your-device-ip-address

Open the DLR documentation, open Installing DLR, and locate the wheel URL for Raspberry Pi devices. Then, follow the instructions to install the DLR on your device. For example, you can use pip:

pip3 install rasp3b-wheel-url


After you install the DLR, validate the following configuration:
    Make sure the ggc_user system account can use the DLR library.
sudo -u ggc_user bash -c 'python3 -c "import dlr"'
    Make sure NumPy is installed.
sudo -u ggc_user bash -c 'python3 -c "import numpy"'


Step 3: Create an inference Lambda function
In this step, create a Lambda function deployment package and Lambda function. Then, publish a function version and create an alias. 


On your computer, download the DLR sample for Raspberry Pi from Machine learning samples.


Unzip the downloaded dlr-py3-armv7l.tar.gz file. 


cd path-to-downloaded-sample
   tar -xvzf dlr-py3-armv7l.tar.gz
The examples directory in the extracted sample package contains function code and dependencies.
    inference.py is the inference code used in this tutorial. You can use this code as a template to create your own inference function.
    greengrasssdk is version 1.5.0 of the AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK for Python.
Note 
If a new version is available, you can download it and upgrade the SDK version in your deployment package. For more information, see  AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK for Python on GitHub.

Compress the contents of the examples directory into a file named optimizedImageClassification.zip. This is your deployment package. 

cd path-to-downloaded-sample/dlr-py3-armv7l/examples
   zip -r optimizedImageClassification.zip .
The deployment package contains your function code and dependencies\. This includes the code that invokes the Neo deep learning runtime Python APIs to perform inference with the Neo deep learning compiler models\.

Note 
 Make sure the .py ﬁles and dependencies are in the root of the directory. 


Now, add the Lambda function to your Greengrass group. 
In the AWS IoT console, in the navigation pane, choose Greengrass, and then choose Groups. 



Choose the Greengrass group where you want to add the Lambda function.


On the group configuration page, choose Lambdas, and then choose Add Lambda.



On the Add a Lambda to your Greengrass Group page, choose Create new Lambda. This opens the AWS Lambda console. 



Choose Author from scratch and use the following values to create your function:
    For Function name, enter optimizedImageClassification. 
    For Runtime, choose Python 3.7.


For Permissions, keep the default setting. This creates an execution role that grants basic Lambda permissions. This role isn't used by AWS IoT Greengrass.


Choose Create function. 

Now, upload your Lambda function deployment package and register the handler.


On the Configuration tab for the optimizedImageClassification function, for Function code, use the following values: 
    For Code entry type, choose Upload a .zip file.
    For Runtime, choose Python 3.7.
    For Handler, enter inference.handler.


Choose Upload.



Choose your optimizedImageClassification.zip deployment package.


Choose Save.


Next, publish the first version of your Lambda function. Then, create an alias for the version.
Note
Greengrass groups can reference a Lambda function by alias (recommended) or by version. Using an alias makes it easier to manage code updates because you don't have to change your subscription table or group definition when the function code is updated. Instead, you just point the alias to the new function version.


From the Actions menu, choose Publish new version.



For Version description, enter First version, and then choose Publish.


On the optimizedImageClassification: 1 configuration page, from the Actions menu, choose Create alias.



On the Create a new alias page, use the following values:
    For Name, enter mlTestOpt.
    For Version, enter 1.
Note
AWS IoT Greengrass doesn't support Lambda aliases for $LATEST versions.


Choose Create.


Now, add the Lambda function to your Greengrass group.
Step 4: Add the Lambda function to the Greengrass group
In this step, add the Lambda function to the group, and then configure its lifecycle.
First, add the Lambda function to your Greengrass group.


On the Add a Lambda to your Greengrass Group page, choose Use existing Lambda. 



Choose optimizedImageClassification, and then choose Next. 


On the Select a Lambda version page, choose Alias:mlTestOpt, and then choose Finish.


Next, configure the lifecycle of the Lambda function.


On the Lambdas page, choose the optimizedImageClassification Lambda function.



On the optimizedImageClassification configuration page, choose Edit.


On the Group-specific Lambda configuration page, make the following updates.
Note
 We recommend that you run your Lambda function without containerization unless your business case requires it. This helps enable access to your device GPU and camera without configuring device resources. If you run without containerization, you must also grant root access to your AWS IoT Greengrass Lambda functions. 


To run without containerization:


For Run as, choose Another user ID/group ID. For UID, enter 0. For GUID, enter 0.
This allows your Lambda function to run as root. For more information about running as root, see Setting the default access identity for Lambda functions in a group.
Tip
You also must update your config.json file to grant root access to your Lambda function. For the procedure, see Running a Lambda function as root.
       For Containerization, choose No container.
For more information about running without containerization, see Considerations when choosing Lambda function containerization.
       For Timeout, enter 10 seconds.
       For Lambda lifecycle, choose Make this function long-lived and keep it running indefinitely.
For more information, see Lifecycle configuration for Greengrass Lambda functions.
       For Read access to /sys directory, choose Enable.




To run in containerized mode instead:
Note
We do not recommend running in containerized mode unless your business case requires it.

For Run as, choose Use group default.
For Containerization, choose Use group default.
For Memory limit, enter 1024 MB.
For Timeout, enter 10 seconds.

For Lambda lifecycle, choose Make this function long-lived and keep it running indefinitely.
For more information, see Lifecycle configuration for Greengrass Lambda functions.
       For Read access to /sys directory, choose Enable.




Choose Update.


Step 5: Add a SageMaker Neo-optimized model resource to the Greengrass group
In this step, create a resource for the optimized ML inference model and upload it to an Amazon S3 bucket. Then, locate the Amazon S3 uploaded model in the AWS IoT Greengrass console and affiliate the newly created resource with the Lambda function. This makes it possible for the function to access its resources on the core device. 

On your computer, navigate to the resnet50 directory in the sample package that you unzipped in Step 3: Create an inference Lambda function. 
Note
If using the NVIDIA Jetson example, you need to use the resnet18 directory in the sample package instead. For more information, see Configuring an NVIDIA Jetson TX2.

cd path-to-downloaded-sample/dlr-py3-armv7l/models/resnet50
This directory contains precompiled model artifacts for an image classification model trained with Resnet\-50\.


Compress the files inside the resnet50 directory into a file named resnet50.zip. 

zip -r resnet50.zip .


On the group configuration page for your AWS IoT Greengrass group, choose Resources. Navigate to the Machine Learning section and choose Add machine learning resource. On the Create a machine learning resource page, for Resource name, enter resnet50_model.



For Model source, choose Upload a model in S3.


Under Model from S3, choose Select. 
Note
 Currently, optimized SageMaker models are stored automatically in Amazon S3. You can find your optimized model in your Amazon S3 bucket using this option. For more information about model optimization in SageMaker, see the SageMaker Neo documentation. 


Choose Upload a model. 


On the Amazon S3 console tab, upload your zip file to an Amazon S3 bucket. For information, see  How do I upload files and folders to an S3 bucket?  in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide. 
Note*
 Your bucket name must contain the string greengrass. Choose a unique name (such as *greengrass-dlr-bucket-user-id-epoch-time). Don't use a period (.) in the bucket name. 


In the AWS IoT Greengrass console tab, locate and choose your Amazon S3 bucket. Locate your uploaded resnet50.zip file, and choose Select. You might need to refresh the page to update the list of available buckets and files. 


In Local path, enter /ml_model. 

This is the destination for the local model in the Lambda runtime namespace. When you deploy the group, AWS IoT Greengrass retrieves the source model package and then extracts the contents to the specified directory. 
Note
 We strongly recommend that you use the exact path provided for your local path. Using a different local model destination path in this step causes some troubleshooting commands provided in this tutorial to be inaccurate. If you use a different path, you must set up a MODEL_PATH environment variable that uses the exact path you provide here. For information about environment variables, see AWS Lambda environment variables. 


Under Identify resource owner and set access permissions, choose No OS group.


Under Lambda function affiliations, choose Select.


Choose optimizedImageClassification, choose Read-only access, and then choose Done.


Choose Save. 


Step 6: Add your camera device resource to the Greengrass group
In this step, create a resource for the camera module and affiliate it with the Lambda function. This makes it possible for the Lambda function to access the resource on the core device. 
Note
If you run in non-containerized mode, AWS IoT Greengrass can access your device GPU and camera without configuring this device resource. 


On the group configuration page, choose Resources.



On the Local tab, choose Add local resource.


On the Create a local resource page, use the following values:
    For Resource name, enter videoCoreSharedMemory.
    For Resource type, choose Device.
    For Device path, enter /dev/vcsm.
The device path is the local absolute path of the device resource. This path can refer only to a character device or block device under /dev.
    For Group owner file access permission, choose Automatically add OS group permissions of the Linux group that owns the resource.
The Group owner file access permission option lets you grant additional file access permissions to the Lambda process. For more information, see Group owner file access permission.



Under Lambda function affiliations, choose Select.


Choose optimizedImageClassification, choose Read and write access, and then choose Done.



Next, you add a local device resource for the camera interface.


At the bottom of the page, choose Add another resource.


On the Create a local resource page, use the following values:
    For Resource name, enter videoCoreInterface.
    For Resource type, choose Device.
    For device path, enter /dev/vchiq.
    For Group owner file access permission, choose Automatically add OS group permissions of the Linux group that owns the resource.



Under Lambda function affiliations, choose Select.


Choose optimizedImageClassification, choose Read and write access, and then choose Done. 


Choose Save. 


Step 7: Add subscriptions to the Greengrass group
In this step, add subscriptions to the group. These subscriptions enable the Lambda function to send prediction results to AWS IoT by publishing to an MQTT topic.


On the group configuration page, choose Subscriptions, and then choose Add Subscription.



On the Select your source and target page, configure the source and target, as follows:


In Select a source, choose Lambdas, and then choose optimizedImageClassification.


In Select a target, choose Services, and then choose IoT Cloud.


Choose Next.



On the Filter your data with a topic page, in Optional topic filter, enter /resnet-50/predictions, and then choose Next. 



Choose Finish.


Add a second subscription. On the Select your source and target page, configure the source and target, as follows: 


In Select a source, choose Services, and then choose IoT Cloud.


In Select a target, choose Lambdas, and then choose optimizedImageClassification.


Choose Next.


On the Filter your data with a topic page, in Optional topic filter, enter /resnet-50/test, and then choose Next.


Choose Finish.


Step 8: Deploy the Greengrass group
In this step, deploy the current version of the group definition to the Greengrass core device. The definition contains the Lambda function, resources, and subscription configurations that you added.


Make sure that the AWS IoT Greengrass core is running. Run the following commands in your Raspberry Pi terminal, as needed.


To check whether the daemon is running:
ps aux | grep -E 'greengrass.*daemon'
If the output contains a root entry for /greengrass/ggc/packages/latest-core-version/bin/daemon, then the daemon is running.


To start the daemon:
cd /greengrass/ggc/core/
  sudo ./greengrassd start


On the group configuration page, choose Deployments, and from the Actions menu, choose Deploy.



On the Configure how devices discover your core page, choose Automatic detection.


This enables devices to automatically acquire connectivity information for the core, such as IP address, DNS, and port number. Automatic detection is recommended, but AWS IoT Greengrass also supports manually specified endpoints. You're only prompted for the discovery method the first time that the group is deployed.

Note
If prompted, grant permission to create the Greengrass service role and associate it with your AWS account in the current AWS Region. This role allows AWS IoT Greengrass to access your resources in AWS services.
The **Deployments** page shows the deployment timestamp, version ID, and status\. When completed, the status displayed for the deployment should be **Successfully completed**\.


For more information about deployments, see Deploy AWS IoT Greengrass groups to an AWS IoT Greengrass core. For troubleshooting help, see Troubleshooting AWS IoT Greengrass.
Test the inference example
Now you can verify whether the deployment is configured correctly. To test, you subscribe to the /resnet-50/predictions topic and publish any message to the /resnet-50/test topic. This triggers the Lambda function to take a photo with your Raspberry Pi and perform inference on the image it captures. 
Note
If using the NVIDIA Jetson example, make sure to use the resnet-18/predictions and resnet-18/test topics instead.
Note
If a monitor is attached to the Raspberry Pi, the live camera feed is displayed in a preview window.


On the AWS IoT console home page, choose Test.



For Subscriptions, choose Subscribe to a Topic. Use the following values. Leave the remaining options at their defaults. 
    For Subscription topic, enter /resnet-50/predictions.
    For MQTT payload display, choose Display payloads as strings.


Choose Subscribe to topic.


On the /resnet-50/predictions page, specify the /resnet-50/test topic to publish to. Choose Publish to topic. 


If the test is successful, the published message causes the Raspberry Pi camera to capture an image. A message from the Lambda function appears at the bottom of the page. This message contains the prediction result of the image, using the format: predicted class name, probability, and peak memory usage. 



Configuring an Intel Atom
To run this tutorial on an Intel Atom device, you must provide source images, configure the Lambda function, and add another local device resource. To use the GPU for inference, make sure the following software is installed on your device:
 OpenCL version 1.0 or later
 Python 3.7 and pip
 NumPy
 OpenCV on Wheels

Download static PNG or JPG images for the Lambda function to use for image classification. The example works best with small image files. 

Save your image files in the directory that contains the inference.py file (or in a subdirectory of this directory). This is in the Lambda function deployment package that you upload in Step 3: Create an inference Lambda function.
Note
 If you're using AWS DeepLens, you can use the onboard camera or mount your own camera to perform inference on captured images instead of static images. However, we strongly recommend you start with static images first. 
If you use a camera, make sure that the awscam APT package is installed and up to date. For more information, see Update your AWS DeepLens device in the AWS DeepLens Developer Guide.


Edit the configuration of the Lambda function. Follow the procedure in Step 4: Add the Lambda function to the Greengrass group. 
Note
 We recommend that you run your Lambda function without containerization unless your business case requires it. This helps enable access to your device GPU and camera without configuring device resources. If you run without containerization, you must also grant root access to your AWS IoT Greengrass Lambda functions. 


To run without containerization:


For Run as, choose Another user ID/group ID. For UID, enter 0. For GUID, enter 0.
This allows your Lambda function to run as root. For more information about running as root, see Setting the default access identity for Lambda functions in a group.
Tip
You also must update your config.json file to grant root access to your Lambda function. For the procedure, see Running a Lambda function as root.
       For Containerization, choose No container.
For more information about running without containerization, see Considerations when choosing Lambda function containerization.
       Increase the Timeout value to 2 minutes. This ensures that the request does not time out too early. It takes a few minutes after setup to run inference.
        For Read access to /sys directory, choose Enable. 
        For Lambda lifecycle, choose Make this function long-lived and keep it running indefinitely. 




To run in containerized mode instead:
Note
We do not recommend running in containerized mode unless your business case requires it.

Increase the Memory limit value to 3000 MB. 
Increase the Timeout value to 2 minutes. This ensures that the request does not time out too early. It takes a few minutes after setup to run inference.
For Read access to /sys directory, choose Enable. 
For Lambda lifecycle, choose Make this function long-lived and keep it running indefinitely. 



Add your Neo-optimized model resource to the group. Upload the model resources in the resnet18 directory of the sample package you unzipped in Step 3: Create an inference Lambda function. This directory contains precompiled model artifacts for an image classification model trained with Resnet-18. Follow the procedure in Step 5: Add a SageMaker Neo-optimized model resource to the Greengrass group with the following updates. 
    Compress the files inside the resnet18 directory into a file named resnet18.zip.
    On the Create a machine learning resource page, for Resource name, enter resnet18_model.
    Upload the resnet18.zip file.


If running in containerized mode, add the required local device resource to grant access to your device GPU.
Note
 If you run in non-containerized mode, AWS IoT Greengrass can access your device GPU without configuring device resources. 


On the group configuration page, choose Resources.



On the Local tab, choose Add a local resource.


Define the resource:

For Resource name, enter renderD128.
For Resource type, choose Device.
For Device path, enter /dev/dri/renderD128.
For Group owner file access permission, choose Automatically add OS group permissions of the Linux group that owns the resource.
For Lambda function affiliations, grant Read and write access to your Lambda function.



Configuring an NVIDIA Jetson TX2
To run this tutorial on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2, provide source images, configure the Lambda function, and add more local device resources.


Make sure your Jetson device is configured so you can install the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software and use the GPU for inference. For more information about configuring your device, see Setting up other devices. To use the GPU for inference on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2, you must install CUDA 10.0 and cuDNN 7.0 on your device when you image your board with Jetpack 4.3.


Download static PNG or JPG images for the Lambda function to use for image classification. The example works best with small image files. 


Save your image files in the directory that contains the inference.py file. You can also save them in a subdirectory of this directory. This directory is in the Lambda function deployment package that you upload in Step 3: Create an inference Lambda function.
Note
 You can instead choose to instrument a camera on the Jetson board to capture the source images. However, we strongly recommend you start with static images first. 


Edit the configuration of the Lambda function. Follow the procedure in Step 4: Add the Lambda function to the Greengrass group.
Note
 We recommend that you run your Lambda function without containerization unless your business case requires it. This helps enable access to your device GPU and camera without configuring device resources. If you run without containerization, you must also grant root access to your AWS IoT Greengrass Lambda functions. 


To run without containerization:


For Run as, choose Another user ID/group ID. For UID, enter 0. For GUID, enter 0.
This allows your Lambda function to run as root. For more information about running as root, see Setting the default access identity for Lambda functions in a group.
Tip
You also must update your config.json file to grant root access to your Lambda function. For the procedure, see Running a Lambda function as root.
       For Containerization, choose No container.
For more information about running without containerization, see Considerations when choosing Lambda function containerization.
       Increase the Timeout value to 5 minutes. This ensures that the request does not time out too early. It takes a few minutes after setup to run inference.
        For Lambda lifecycle, choose Make this function long-lived and keep it running indefinitely. 
        For Read access to /sys directory, choose Enable. 




To run in containerized mode instead:
Note
We do not recommend running in containerized mode unless your business case requires it.

Increase the Memory limit value. To use the provided model in GPU mode, use at least 2000 MB. 
Increase the Timeout value to 5 minutes. This ensures that the request does not time out too early. It takes a few minutes after setup to run inference.
For Lambda lifecycle, choose Make this function long-lived and keep it running indefinitely. 
For Read access to /sys directory, choose Enable. 



Add your Neo-optimized model resource to the group. Upload the model resources in the resnet18 directory of the sample package you unzipped in Step 3: Create an inference Lambda function. This directory contains precompiled model artifacts for an image classification model trained with Resnet-18. Follow the procedure in Step 5: Add a SageMaker Neo-optimized model resource to the Greengrass group with the following updates. 
    Compress the files inside the resnet18 directory into a file named resnet18.zip.
    On the Create a machine learning resource page, for Resource name, enter resnet18_model.
    Upload the resnet18.zip file.


If running in containerized mode, add the required local device resources to grant access to your device GPU. 
Note
 If you run in non-containerized mode, AWS IoT Greengrass can access your device GPU without configuring device resources. 


On the group configuration page, choose Resources.



On the Local tab, choose Add a local resource.


Define each resource:

For Resource name and Device path, use the values in the following table. Create one device resource for each row in the table.
For Resource type, choose Device.
For Group owner file access permission, choose Automatically add OS group permissions of the Linux group that owns the resource.

For Lambda function affiliations, grant Read and write access to your Lambda function.
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]




If running in containerized mode, add the following local volume resource to grant access to your device camera. Follow the procedure in Step 5: Add a SageMaker Neo-optimized model resource to the Greengrass group.
Note
 If you run in non-containerized mode, AWS IoT Greengrass can access your device camera without configuring device resources. 
    For Resource type, choose Volume.
    For Group owner file access permission, choose Automatically add OS group permissions of the Linux group that owns the resource.
    For Lambda function affiliations, grant Read and write access to your Lambda function.
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Update your group subscriptions to use the correct directory. Follow the procedure in Step 7: Add subscriptions to the Greengrass group with the following updates. 
    For your first topic filter, enter /resnet-18/predictions.
    For your second topic filter, enter /resnet-18/test.


Update your test subscriptions to use the correct directory. Follow the procedure in Test the inference example with the following updates. 
     For Subscriptions, choose Subscribe to a Topic. For Subscription topic, enter /resnet-18/predictions. 
     On the /resnet-18/predictions page, specify the /resnet-18/test topic to publish to. 


Troubleshooting AWS IoT Greengrass ML inference
If the test is not successful, you can try the following troubleshooting steps. Run the commands in your Raspberry Pi terminal.
Check error logs

Switch to the root user and navigate to the log directory. Access to AWS IoT Greengrass logs requires root permissions.

sudo su
   cd /greengrass/ggc/var/log

Check runtime.log for any errors. 

cat system/runtime.log | grep 'ERROR'
You can also look in your user-defined Lambda function log for any errors: 
cat user/your-region/your-account-id/lambda-function-name.log | grep 'ERROR'
For more information, see Troubleshooting with logs.
Verify the Lambda function is successfully deployed

List the contents of the deployed Lambda in the /lambda directory. Replace the placeholder values before you run the command. 

cd /greengrass/ggc/deployment/lambda/arn:aws:lambda:region:account:function:function-name:function-version
   ls -la


Verify that the directory contains the same content as the optimizedImageClassification.zip deployment package that you uploaded in Step 3: Create an inference Lambda function. 
Make sure that the .py files and dependencies are in the root of the directory. 


Verify the inference model is successfully deployed

Find the process identification number (PID) of the Lambda runtime process:

ps aux | grep lambda-function-name
In the output, the PID appears in the second column of the line for the Lambda runtime process.

Enter the Lambda runtime namespace. Be sure to replace the placeholder pid value before you run the command. 
Note
This directory and its contents are in the Lambda runtime namespace, so they aren't visible in a regular Linux namespace.

sudo nsenter -t pid -m /bin/bash

List the contents of the local directory that you specified for the ML resource.
Note
 If your ML resource path is something other than ml_model, you must substitute that here. 

cd /ml_model
   ls -ls
You should see the following files:
56 -rw-r--r-- 1 ggc_user ggc_group     56703 Oct 29 20:07 model.json
   196152 -rw-r--r-- 1 ggc_user ggc_group 200855043 Oct 29 20:08 model.params
      256 -rw-r--r-- 1 ggc_user ggc_group    261848 Oct 29 20:07 model.so
       32 -rw-r--r-- 1 ggc_user ggc_group     30564 Oct 29 20:08 synset.txt
Lambda function cannot find /dev/dri/renderD128
This can occur if OpenCL cannot connect to the GPU devices it needs. You must create device resources for the necessary devices for your Lambda function. 
Next steps
Next, explore other optimized models. For information, see the SageMaker Neo documentation.
