Data encryption
AWS IoT Greengrass uses encryption to protect data while in-transit (over the internet or local network) and at rest (stored in the AWS Cloud).
Devices in a AWS IoT Greengrass environment often collect data that's sent to AWS services for further processing. For more information about data encryption on other AWS services, see the security documentation for that service.
