Running tests
After you set the required configuration, you can start the tests. The runtime of the full test suite depends on your hardware. For reference, it takes approximately 30 minutes to complete the full test suite on a Raspberry Pi 3B.
The following example run-suite commands show you how to run the qualification tests for a device pool. A device pool is a set of identical devices.

[ IDT v3.0.0 and later ]
Run all test groups in a specified test suite.  
devicetester_[linux | mac | win_x86-64] run-suite --suite-id GGQ_1.0.0 --pool-id <pool-id>
Use the list-suites command to list the test suites that are in the tests folder.
Run a specific test group in a test suite.  
devicetester_[linux | mac | win_x86-64] run-suite --suite-id GGQ_1.0.0 --group-id <group-id> --pool-id <pool-id>
Use the list-groups command to list the test groups in a test suite.
Run a specific test case in a test group.  
devicetester_[linux | mac | win_x86-64] run-suite --group-id <group-id> --test-id <test-id>
Run multiple test cases in a test group.  
devicetester_[linux | mac | win_x86-64] run-suite --group-id <group-id> --test-id <test-id1>,<test-id2>
List the test cases in a test group.  
devicetester_[linux | mac | win_x86-64] list-test-cases --group-id <group-id>
The options for the run-suite command are optional. For example, you can omit pool-id if you have only one device pool defined in your device.json file. Or, you can omit suite-id if you want to run the latest test suite version in the tests folder.
Note
IDT prompts you if a newer test suite version is available online. For more information, see IDT for AWS IoT Greengrass test suite versions.
For more information about run-suite and other IDT commands, see IDT for AWS IoT Greengrass commands.

[ IDT v2.3.0 and earlier ]
Run all test groups in a specified suite.  
devicetester_[linux | mac | win_x86-64] run-suite --suite-id GGQ_1 --pool-id <pool-id>
Run a specific test group.  
devicetester_[linux | mac | win_x86-64] run-suite --suite-id GGQ_1 --group-id <group-id> --pool-id <pool-id>
suite-id and pool-id are optional if you are running a single test suite on a single device pool. This means that you have only one device pool defined in your device.json file.

We recommend that you run the dependency checker test group to make sure all Greengrass dependencies are installed before you run related test groups. For example:
 Run ggcdependencies before running core qualification test groups.
 Run containerdependencies before running container-specific test groups.
 Run dockerdependencies before running Docker-specific test groups.
 Run ggcstreammanagementdependencies before running stream manager-specific test groups.
IDT for AWS IoT Greengrass commands
The IDT commands are located in the <device-tester-extract-location>/bin directory. Use them for the following operations:

[ IDT v3.0.0 and later ]
help 
Lists information about the specified command.
list-groups 
Lists the groups in a given test suite.
list-suites 
Lists the available test suites.
list-supported-products
Lists the supported products, in this case AWS IoT Greengrass versions, and test suite versions for the current IDT version.
list-test-cases
Lists the test cases in a given test group. The following option is supported:
 group-id. The test group to search for. This option is required and must specify a single group.
run-suite
Runs a suite of tests on a pool of devices. The following are some supported options:
 suite-id. The test suite version to run. If not specified, IDT uses the latest version in the tests folder.
 group-id. The test groups to run, as a comma-separated list. If not specified, IDT runs all test groups in the test suite.
 test-id. The test cases to run, as a comma-separated list. When specified, group-id must specify a single group.
 pool-id. The device pool to test. You must specify a pool if you have multiple device pools defined in your device.json file.
 upgrade-test-suite. Controls how test suite version updates are handled. Starting in IDT v3.0.0, IDT checks online for updated test suite versions. For more information, see IDT for AWS IoT Greengrass test suite versions.
 stop-on-first-failure. Configures IDT to stop execution on the first failure. This option should be used with group-id to debug the specified test groups. Do not use this option when running a full test-suite to generate a qualification report.
 update-idt. Sets the response for the prompt to update IDT. Y as input stops the test execution if IDT detects there is a newer version. N as input continues the test execution.
 update-managed-policy. Y as input stops the test execution if IDT detects that the user's managed policy isnâ€™t updated. N as input continues the test execution.
For more information about run-suite options, use the help option:  
devicetester_[linux | mac | win_x86-64] run-suite -h

[ IDT v2.3.0 and earlier ]
help 
Lists information about the specified command.
list-groups 
Lists the groups in a given test suite.
list-suites 
Lists the available test suites.
run-suite
Runs a suite of tests on a pool of devices.
For more information about run-suite options, use the help option:  
devicetester_[linux | mac | win_x86-64] run-suite -h

IDT for AWS IoT Greengrass test suite versions
IDT for AWS IoT Greengrass organizes tests into test suites and test groups.
 A test suite is the set of test groups used to verify that a device works with particular versions of AWS IoT Greengrass.
 A test group is the set of individual tests related to a particular feature, such as Greengrass group deployments and MQTT messaging.
Starting in IDT v3.0.0, test suites are versioned using a major.minor.patch format, for example GGQ_1.0.0. When you download IDT, the package includes the latest test suite version.
Important
IDT supports the three latest test suite versions for device qualification. For more information, see Support policy for AWS IoT Device Tester for AWS IoT Greengrass.
You can run list-supported-products to list the versions of AWS IoT Greengrass and test suites that are supported by your current version of IDT. Tests from unsupported test suite versions are not valid for device qualification. IDT doesn't print qualification reports for unsupported versions.
When you start a test run, IDT checks online for a newer test suite version. If one is available, IDT prompts you to update to the latest available version. You can set the upgrade-test-suite (or u) flag to control the default update behavior. Valid values are:
 y. IDT downloads and uses the latest available version.
 n (default). IDT uses the version specified in the suite-id option. If suite-id is not specifed, IDT uses the latest version in the tests folder.
If you don't include the upgrade-test-suite flag, IDT prompts you when an update is available and waits 30 seconds for your input (y or n). If no input is entered, it defaults to n and continues running the tests.
The following examples show common use cases for this feature:
Automatically use the latest tests available for a test group. 
devicetester_linux run-suite -u y --group-id mqtt --pool-id DevicePool1
Run tests in a specific test suite version. 
devicetester_linux run-suite -u n --suite-id GGQ_1.0.0 --group-id mqtt --pool-id DevicePool1
Prompt for updates at runtime. 
devicetester_linux run-suite --pool-id DevicePool1
Updates to IDT configuration settings
New tests might introduce new IDT configuration settings.
 If the settings are optional, IDT continues running the tests.
 If the settings are required, IDT notifies you and stops running. After you configure the settings, restart the test run.
Configuration settings are located in the <device_tester_extract_location>/configs folder. For more information, see Setting configuration to run the AWS IoT Greengrass qualification suite.
If an updated test suite version adds configuration settings, IDT creates a copy of the original configuration file in <device_tester_extract_location>/configs.
