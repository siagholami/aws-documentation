Security standards and controls in AWS Security Hub
AWS Security Hub consumes, aggregates, and analyzes security findings from various supported AWS and third-party products.
Security Hub also generates its own findings as the result of running automated and continuous checks against the rules in a set of supported security standards. These checks provide a readiness score and identify specific accounts and resources that require attention.
Security Hub provides controls for the following standards.
 CIS AWS Foundations
 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
 AWS Foundational Security Best Practices
