Deleting member accounts
As a master account, you can delete your member accounts. You cannot delete enabled accounts. Before you can delete an enabled account, you must disassociate it.
When you delete a member account, it is completely removed from the list. To restore the account's membership, you must add it and invite it as if it were a completely new member account.
