Using service-linked roles for AWS Security Hub
AWS Security Hub uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Security Hub. Service-linked roles are predefined by Security Hub and include all the permissions that Security Hub requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. 
A service-linked role makes setting up Security Hub easier because you don't have to manually add the necessary permissions. Security Hub defines the permissions of its service-linked role, and unless the permissions are defined otherwise, only Security Hub can assume the role. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and you can't attach that permissions policy to any other IAM entity.
Security Hub supports using service-linked roles in all of the Regions where Security Hub is available. For more information, see Supported Regions.
You can delete the Security Hub service-linked role only after first disabling Security Hub in all Regions where it's enabled. This protects your Security Hub resources because you can't inadvertently remove permissions to access them.
For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS services that work with IAM in the IAM User Guide and locate the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column. Choose a Yes with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.
Service-linked role permissions for Security Hub
Security Hub uses the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForSecurityHub. It's a service-linked role required for AWS Security Hub to access your resources.
The AWSServiceRoleForSecurityHub service-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:
 securityhub.amazonaws.com
The role permissions policy allows Security Hub to complete the following actions on the specified resources:
 Action: cloudtrail:DescribeTrails 
 Action: cloudtrail:GetTrailStatus 
 Action: cloudtrail:GetEventSelectors 
 Action: cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms 
 Action: logs:DescribeMetricFilters 
 Action: sns:ListSubscriptionsByTopic 
 Action: config:DescribeConfigurationRecorders 
 Action: config:DescribeConfigurationRecorderStatus 
 Action: config:DescribeConfigRules 
 Action: config:BatchGetResourceConfig 
 Resources: * 
And:
 Action: config:PutConfigRule
 Action: config:DeleteConfigRule
 Action: config:GetComplianceDetailsByConfigRule
 Action: config:DescribeConfigRuleEvaluationStatus
 Resources: arn:aws:config:*:*:config-rule/aws-service-rule/*securityhub*
You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For the AWSServiceRoleForSecurityHub service-linked role to be successfully created, the IAM identity that you use Security Hub with must have the required permissions. To grant the required permissions, attach the following policy to this IAM user, group, or role.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "securityhub:*",
            "Resource": "*"    
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "iam:AWSServiceName": "securityhub.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
Creating a service-linked role for Security Hub
The AWSServiceRoleForSecurityHub service-linked role is automatically created when you enable Security Hub for the first time or enable Security Hub in a supported Region where you previously didn't have it enabled. You can also create the AWSServiceRoleForSecurityHub service-linked role manually using the IAM console, the IAM CLI, or the IAM API. 
Important
The service-linked role that is created for the Security Hub master account doesn't apply to the Security Hub member accounts.
For more information about creating the role manually, see Creating a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.
Editing a service-linked role for Security Hub
Security Hub doesn't allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForSecurityHub service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you can't change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role by using IAM. For more information, see Editing a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.
Deleting a service-linked role for Security Hub
If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role. That way, you don't have an unused entity that isn't actively monitored or maintained. 
Important
To delete the AWSServiceRoleForSecurityHub service-linked role, you must first disable Security Hub in all Regions where it's enabled.
If Security Hub isn't disabled when you try to delete the service-linked role, the deletion fails. For more information, see Disabling AWS Security Hub.
When you disable Security Hub, the AWSServiceRoleForSecurityHub service-linked role is not automatically deleted. If you enable Security Hub again, it starts using the existing AWSServiceRoleForSecurityHub service-linked role.
To manually delete the service-linked role using IAM
Use the IAM console, the IAM CLI, or the IAM API to delete the AWSServiceRoleForSecurityHub service-linked role. For more information, see Deleting a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.
