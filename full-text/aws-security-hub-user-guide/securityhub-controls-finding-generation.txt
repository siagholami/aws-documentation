How AWS Security Hub generates findings from security checks
For each enabled control, AWS Security Hub runs security checks. A security check determines whether your resources are in compliance with the control requirements.
Some checks run on a regular schedule. Other checks only run when there is a change to the resource state. See Schedule for running security checks.
Many security checks use AWS Config managed rules to establish the compliance requirements. To run these checks, you must have AWS Config enabled. See AWS Config requirements for running security checks. Others use custom Lambda functions.
For each check, Security Hub creates or updates a finding. Security Hub uses the findings to assess your security posture for each control and across an entire standard. See Results of security checks.
