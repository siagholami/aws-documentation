Disabling or enabling a security standard
You can disable or enable each security standard.
Remember that Security Hub is Regional. When you enable or disable a security standard, it is enabled or disabled only in the current Region or in the Region that you specify in an API request.
When you disable a security standard, the following occurs:
 The checks for its controls are no longer performed.
 No additional findings are generated for its controls.
 The related AWS Config rules that Security Hub created are removed.
When you enable a security standard, all of the controls for that standard are enabled by default. You can then disable individual controls. See Disabling and enabling individual controls.

On the Security standards page, each enabled standard includes an option to disable the standard.
