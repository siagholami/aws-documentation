AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF)
AWS Security Hub consumes, aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes findings from AWS security services and from the third-party product integrations. Security Hub processes these findings using a standard findings format called the AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF), which eliminates the need for time-consuming data conversion efforts. Then it correlates ingested findings across products to prioritize the most important ones.

ASFF attributes
The following table lists the top-level attributes and objects for the ASFF. For objects, to see the details for the object attributes and subfields, choose the object name.



Attribute
Required
Description




AwsAccountId
Yes
The AWS account ID that the finding applies to. Type: String (12 digits max) Example: "AwsAccountId": "111111111111"


Compliance
No
Finding details related to a control. Only returned for findings generated from a control. Type: Object Example: "Compliance": {    "RelatedRequirements": ["Req1", "Req2"],    "Status": "PASSED",    "StatusReasons": [        {            "ReasonCode": "CLOUDWATCH_ALARMS_NOT_PRESENT";            "Description": "CloudWatch alarms do not exist in the account"        }    ]}


Confidence
No
A finding's confidence. Confidence is defined as the likelihood that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue that it was intended to identify. A finding provider can provide an initial value for this attribute, but cannot update it after that. This attribute can only be updated using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html. Type: Integer (range 0–100) Confidence is scored on a 0–100 basis using a ratio scale, where 0 means zero-percent confidence and 100 means 100-percent confidence. However, a data exfiltration detection based on a statistical deviation of network traffic has a much lower confidence because an actual exfiltration hasn't been verified. Example: "Confidence": 42

Indicates when the potential security issue captured by a finding was created. The CreatedAt timestamp reflects the time when the finding record was created. Consequently, it can differ from the FirstObservedAt timestamp, which reflects the time when the event or vulnerability was first observed. This timestamp must be provided on the first generation of the finding and can't be changed upon subsequent updates to the finding. Type: String Format: Uses the date-time format specified in RFC 3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format. The value cannot contain spaces. Example: "CreatedAt": "2017-03-22T13:22:13.933Z"  Findings are deleted 90 days after the most recent update or 90 days after the creation date if no update occurs. To store findings for longer than 90 days, you can configure a rule in CloudWatch Events that routes findings to your Amazon S3 bucket.


Criticality
No
The level of importance that is assigned to the resources that are associated with the finding. A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criticality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources.  A finding provider can provide an initial value for this attribute, but cannot update it after that. This attribute can only be updated using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html. Type: Integer (range 0–100) Criticality is scored on a 0–100 basis, using a ratio scale that supports only full integers. A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criticality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources. At a high level, when assessing criticality, you need to consider the following: [See the AWS documentation website for more details] For each resource, consider the following: [See the AWS documentation website for more details] You can use the following guidelines: [See the AWS documentation website for more details] Example: "Criticality": 99

LastObservedAt
No
Indicates when the potential security issue captured by a finding was most recently observed by the security findings product. This timestamp reflects the time of when the event or vulnerability was last or most recently observed. Consequently, it can differ from the UpdatedAt timestamp, which reflects when this finding record was last or most recently updated.  You can provide this timestamp, but it isn't required upon the first observation. If you provide the field in this case, the timestamp should be the same as the FirstObservedAt timestamp. You should update this field to reflect the last or most recently observed timestamp each time a finding is observed. Type: String Format: Uses the date-time format specified in RFC 3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format. The value cannot contain spaces. Example: "LastObservedAt": "2017-03-23T13:22:13.933Z"

 The resource type does not have a corresponding subfield. To provide details for the resource, you use the Other subfield.
 The subfield for the resource type does not include all of the fields you want to populate. In this case, use the subfield for the resource type to populate the available fields. Use the Other subfield to populate the fields that are not in the type-specific subfield.
 The resource type is not one of the provided types. In this case, you set Resource.Type to Other, and use the Other subfield to populate the details.
Type: Map of up to 50 key-value pairs
Each key-value pair must meet the following requirements.
 The key must contain fewer than 128 characters.
 The value must contain fewer than 1,024 characters.
Severity
Details about the severity of the finding.
The finding provider can provide the initial severity, but cannot update it after that. The severity can only be updated using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html.
The finding severity does not consider the criticality of the involved assets or the underlying resource. Criticality is defined as the level of importance of the resources that are associated with the finding. For example, a resource that is associated with a mission critical application versus one that is associated with nonproduction testing. To capture information about resource criticality, use the Criticality field.
The finding must have either Label or Normalized populated. If neither attribute is populated, then the finding is invalid. Label is the preferred attribute.
The Severity object can have the following attributes.



Attribute
Required
Description




Label
No
The severity value for the finding. Type: Enum Available values: INFORMATIONAL | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH |CRITICAL At a high level, the Label values can be interpreted as follows. [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Normalized (To be deprecated)
No
The normalized severity of a finding. We plan to deprecate this attribute. Instead of Normalized, provide Label. Type: Integer The value of Normalized must be an integer between 0 and 100. Zero means that no severity applies, and 100 means that the finding has the maximum possible severity. For guidance on setting the value of Normalized, see Guidance for assigning the normalized severity (AWS services and partners).


Original
No
The native severity from the finding product that generated the finding. Type: String (maximum 64 characters)


Product (Deprecated)
No
The native severity as defined by the finding product that generated the finding. This is deprecated in favor of Original. Type: Number (single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point number, restricted to finite values)



How Security Hub maps Label and Normalized values
If a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html request for a new finding only provides Label or only provides Normalized, then Security Hub automatically populates the value of the other field.
Security Hub does not make any automatic updates based on changes from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html.
If https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html provides Normalized and does not provide Label, Label is set automatically as follows.



Normalized
Label




0
INFORMATIONAL


1–39
LOW


40–69
MEDIUM


70–89
HIGH


90–100
CRITICAL



If https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html only provides Label and does not provide Normalized, Normalized is set automatically as follows.



Label
Normalized




INFORMATIONAL

Guidance for assigning the normalized severity (AWS services and partners)
For findings generated by AWS services and third-party partner products, the severity is based on the following.
 Most severe – Findings that are associated with actual data loss or denial of service
 Second-most severe – Findings that are associated with an active compromise but that do not indicate that data loss or other negative effects have occurred
 Third-most severe – Findings that are associated with issues that indicate potential for a future compromise
We recommend that you use the following guidance when translating findings' native severity scores to a normalized severity for the ASFF.
 Informational findings. For example, a finding for a passed check or a sensitive data identification.
Suggested score: 0
 Findings that are associated with issues that could result in future compromises. For example, vulnerabilities, configuration weaknesses, exposed passwords.
This generally aligns to the Software and Configuration Checks namespace under a finding's type.
Suggested score: 1–39 (Low)
 Findings that are associated with issues that indicate an active compromise, but no indication that an adversary completed their objectives. For example, malware activity, hacking activity, or unusual behavior detection.
This generally aligns to the Threat Detections and Unusual Behavior namespaces under a finding's type.
Suggested score: 40–69 (Medium)
 Findings that indicate that an adversary completed their objectives, such as active data loss or compromise or a denial of service.
This generally aligns to the Effects namespace under a finding's type.
Suggested score: 70–100 (High or Critical)
