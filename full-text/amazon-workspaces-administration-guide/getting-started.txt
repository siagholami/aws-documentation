Before You Begin

You must have an AWS account to create or administer a WorkSpace. Users do not need an AWS account to connect to and use their WorkSpaces.
When you launch a WorkSpace, you must select a WorkSpace bundle. For more information, see Amazon WorkSpaces Bundles.
When you launch a WorkSpace, you must specify profile information for the user, including a user name and email address. Users complete their profiles by specifying a password. Information about WorkSpaces and users is stored in a directory.
Amazon WorkSpaces is not available in every Region. Verify the supported Regions and  select a Region for your WorkSpaces. For more information about the supported Regions, see Amazon WorkSpaces Pricing by AWS Region.

Step 1: Launch the WorkSpace
Using Quick Setup, you can launch your first WorkSpace in minutes.
To launch a WorkSpace


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


Choose Get Started Now. If you don't see this button, either you have already launched a WorkSpace in this Region, or you aren't using one of the Regions that support Quick Setup. In this case, see Launch a Virtual Desktop Using Amazon WorkSpaces. 


On the Get Started with Amazon WorkSpaces page, next to Quick Setup, choose Launch.



For Bundles, select a bundle (hardware and software) for the user. For more information about the various public bundles available for Amazon WorkSpaces, see Amazon WorkSpaces Bundles.



For Enter User Details, complete Username, First Name, Last Name, and Email.



Choose Launch WorkSpaces.


On the confirmation page, choose View the WorkSpaces Console. It takes approximately 20 minutes for your WorkSpace to be launched. To monitor the progress, go to the left navigation pane and choose Directories. You will see a directory being created with an initial status of REQUESTED and then CREATING. 


After the directory has been created and has a status of ACTIVE, you can choose WorkSpaces in the left navigation pane to monitor the progress of the WorkSpace launch process. The initial status of the WorkSpace is PENDING. When the launch is complete, the status is AVAILABLE and an invitation is sent to the email address that you specified for the user.
Quick Setup
Quick Setup completes the following tasks on your behalf:
 Creates an IAM role to allow the Amazon WorkSpaces service to create elastic network interfaces and list your Amazon WorkSpaces directories. This role has the name workspaces_DefaultRole.
 Creates a virtual private cloud (VPC).
 Sets up a Simple AD directory in the VPC that is used to store user and WorkSpace information. The directory has an administrator account and it is enabled for Amazon WorkDocs.
 Creates the specified user accounts and adds them to the directory.
 Creates WorkSpace instances. Each WorkSpace receives a public IP address to provide internet access. The running mode is AlwaysOn. For more information, see Manage the WorkSpace Running Mode.
 Sends invitation emails to the specified users.
Note
The first user account created by Quick Setup is your Admin user account. You can't update this user account from the Amazon WorkSpaces Console. Don't share the information for this Admin account with anyone else. If you want to invite other users to use this WorkSpace, create new user accounts for them.
Step 2: Connect to the WorkSpace
After you receive the invitation email, you can connect to the WorkSpace using the client of your choice. After you sign in, the client displays the WorkSpace desktop.
To connect to the WorkSpace


If you haven't set up credentials for the user already, open the link in the invitation email and follow the directions. Remember the password that you specify as you will need it to connect to your WorkSpace.
Note
Passwords are case-sensitive and must be between 8 and 64 characters in length, inclusive. Passwords must contain at least one character from three of the following categories: lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and the set \~!@#$%^&*_-=`|\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?/.


Review Amazon WorkSpaces Clients in the Amazon WorkSpaces User Guide for more information about the requirements for each client, and then do one of the following: 
    When prompted, download one of the client applications or launch Web Access.
    If you aren't prompted and you haven't installed a client application already, open https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/ and download one of the client applications or launch Web Access.
Note
You cannot use a web browser (Web Access) to connect to Amazon Linux WorkSpaces.


Start the client, enter the registration code from the invitation email, and choose Register.


When prompted to sign in, enter the user name and password, and then choose Sign In.


(Optional) When prompted to save your credentials, choose Yes.


Step 3: Clean Up (Optional)
If you are finished with the WorkSpace that you created for this tutorial, you can delete it.
To delete the WorkSpace


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose WorkSpaces.


Select your WorkSpace and choose Actions, Remove WorkSpaces.


When prompted for confirmation, choose Remove WorkSpaces.


(Optional) If you are not using the directory with another application, such as Amazon WorkDocs, Amazon WorkMail, or Amazon Chime, you can delete it as follows:


In the navigation pane, choose Directories.


Select your directory and choose Actions, Deregister.


Select your directory again and choose Actions, Delete.


When prompted for confirmation, choose Delete.
