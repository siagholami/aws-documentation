Manage Your Amazon Linux WorkSpaces
As with Windows WorkSpaces, Amazon Linux WorkSpaces are domain joined, so you can use Active Directory Users and Groups to:
 Administer your Amazon Linux WorkSpaces
 Provide access to those WorkSpaces for users
Because Linux instances do not adhere to Group Policy, we recommend that you use a configuration management solution to distribute and enforce policy. For example, you can use AWS Opsworks for Chef Automate, AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise, or Ansible.
Control PCoIP Agent Behavior on Amazon Linux WorkSpaces
The behavior of the PCoIP Agent is controlled by configuration settings in the pcoip-agent.conf file, which is located in the /etc/pcoip-agent/ directory. To deploy and enforce changes to the policy, use a configuration management solution that supports Amazon Linux. Any changes take effect when the agent starts up. Restarting the agent ends any open connections and restarts the window manager. For a full listing of the available settings, run man pcoip-agent.conf from the terminal on any Amazon Linux WorkSpace.
Enable or Disable Clipboard Redirection for Amazon Linux WorkSpaces
By default, Amazon WorkSpaces supports clipboard redirection. Use the PCoIP Agent conf to disable this feature, if needed. 
To enable or disable clipboard redirection for Amazon Linux WorkSpaces

Open the pcoip-agent.conf file in an editor with elevated rights by using the following command.

[domain\username@workspace-id ~]$ sudo vi /etc/pcoip-agent/pcoip-agent.conf

Add the following line to the end of the file.

pcoip.server_clipboard_state = X
Where the possible values for X are:
0 — Disabled in both directions
1 — Enabled in both directions
2 — Enabled client to agent only
3 — Enabled agent to client only
Grant SSH Access to Amazon Linux WorkSpaces Administrators
By default, only assigned users and accounts in the Domain Admins group can connect to Amazon Linux WorkSpaces by using SSH. 
We recommend that you create a dedicated administrators group for your Amazon Linux WorkSpaces administrators in Active Directory.
To enable sudo access for members of the Linux_Workspaces_Admins Active Directory group

Edit the sudoers file by using visudo, as shown in the following example.

[example\username@workspace-id ~]$ sudo visudo

Add the following line.

%example.com\\Linux_WorkSpaces_Admins ALL=(ALL) ALL
After you create the dedicated administrators group, follow these steps to enable login for members of the group.
To enable login for members of the Linux_WorkSpaces_Admins Active Directory group

Edit /etc/security/access.conf with elevated rights.

[example\username@workspace-id ~]$ sudo vi /etc/security/access.conf

Add the following line.

:(example\Linux_WorkSpaces_Admins):ALL
For more information about enabling SSH connections, see Enable SSH Connections for Your Linux WorkSpaces.
Override the Default Shell for Amazon Linux WorkSpaces
To override the default shell for Linux WorkSpaces, we recommend that you edit the user's ~/.bashrc file. For example, to use Z shell instead of Bash shell, add the following lines to /home/username/.bashrc.
export SHELL=$(which zsh)
[ -n "$SSH_TTY" ] && exec $SHELL
Protect Custom Repositories from Unauthorized Access
To control access to your custom repositories, we recommend using the security features built into Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) rather than using passwords. For example, use network access control lists (ACLs) and security groups. For more information about these features, see Security in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
If you must use passwords to protect your repositories, be sure to create your yum repository definition files as shown in Repository Definition Files in the Fedora documentation.
Use the Amazon Linux Extras Library Repository
With Amazon Linux, you can use the Extras Library to install application and software updates on your instances. For information about using the Extras Library, see Extras Library (Amazon Linux) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Note
If you are using the Amazon Linux repository, your Amazon Linux WorkSpaces must have internet access, or you must configure virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoints to this repository and to the main Amazon Linux repository. For more information, see Provide Internet Access from Your WorkSpace.
