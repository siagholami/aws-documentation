Configure a VPC for Amazon WorkSpaces
Amazon WorkSpaces launches your WorkSpaces in a virtual private cloud (VPC). Your WorkSpaces must have access to the internet so that you can install updates to the operating system and deploy applications using Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager (Amazon WAM).
You can create a VPC with two private subnets for your WorkSpaces and a NAT gateway in a public subnet. Alternatively, you can create a VPC with two public subnets for your WorkSpaces and associate an Elastic IP address with each WorkSpace.
VPC Requirements
Your VPC's subnets must reside in different Availability Zones in the Region where you're launching WorkSpaces. Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. By launching instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location. Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones.
Note
Amazon WorkSpaces is available in a subset of the Availability Zones in each supported Region. To determine which Availability Zones you can use for the subnets of the VPC that you're using for WorkSpaces, see Availability Zones for Amazon WorkSpaces.

Configure a VPC with Private Subnets and a NAT Gateway
If you use AWS Directory Service to create an AWS Managed Microsoft or a Simple AD, we recommend that you configure the VPC with one public subnet and two private subnets. Configure your directory to launch your WorkSpaces in the private subnets. To provide internet access to WorkSpaces in a private subnet, configure a NAT gateway in the public subnet.

Prerequisites
If you aren't already familiar with working with VPCs and subnets, we recommend reading  VPC and Subnet Sizing for IPv4 in the Amazon VPC User Guide before performing the following tasks.
Topics
 Step 1: Allocate an Elastic IP Address
 Step 2: Create a VPC
 Step 3: Add a Second Private Subnet
 Step 4: Verify and Name the Route Tables
Step 1: Allocate an Elastic IP Address
Allocate an  Elastic IP address for your NAT gateway as follows. Note that if you are using an alternative method of providing internet access, you can skip this step.
To allocate an Elastic IP address


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.


Choose Allocate new address.


On the Allocate new address page, for iPv4 address pool, choose Amazon pool or Owned by me, and then choose Allocate.


Make a note of the Elastic IP address, then choose Close.


Step 2: Create a VPC
Create a VPC with one public subnet and two private subnets as follows.
To create the VPC


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose VPC Dashboard in the upper-left corner.


Choose Launch VPC Wizard.


Choose VPC with Public and Private Subnets and then choose Select.


Configure the VPC as follows:


For IPv4 CIDR block, enter the CIDR block for the VPC. We recommend that you use a CIDR block from the private (non-publicly routable) IP address ranges specified in RFC 1918. For example, 10.0.0.0/16. For more information, see VPC and Subnet Sizing for IPv4 in the Amazon VPC User Guide.


For IPv6 CIDR Block, keep No IPv6 CIDR Block.


For VPC name, enter a name for the VPC.


Configure the public subnet as follows:


For IPv4 CIDR block, enter the CIDR block for the subnet. For more information, see VPC and Subnet Sizing for IPv4 in the Amazon VPC User Guide.


For Availability Zone, keep No Preference.


For Public subnet name, enter a name for the subnet (for example, WorkSpaces Public Subnet).


Configure the first private subnet as follows:


For Private subnet's IPv4 CIDR, enter the CIDR block for the subnet.


To make an appropriate selection for Availability Zone, see Availability Zones for Amazon WorkSpaces.


For Private subnet name, enter a name for the subnet (for example, WorkSpaces Private Subnet 1).


For Elastic IP Allocation ID, choose the Elastic IP address that you created. Note that if you are using an alternative method of providing internet access, you can skip this step.


For Service endpoints, do nothing.


For Enable DNS hostnames, keep Yes.


For Hardware tenancy, keep Default.


Choose Create VPC. Note that it takes several minutes to set up your VPC. After the VPC is created, choose OK.


Note
You can associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnets. However, if you configure your subnets to automatically assign IPv6 addresses to instances launched in the subnet, then you cannot use Graphics bundles. (You can use GraphicsPro bundles, however.) This restriction arises from a hardware limitation of previous-generation instance types that do not support IPv6.
To work around this issue, you can temporarily disable the auto-assign IPv6 addresses setting on the WorkSpaces subnets before launching Graphics bundles, and then reenable this setting (if needed) after launching Graphics bundles so that any other bundles receive the desired IP addresses.
By default, the auto-assign IPv6 addresses setting is disabled. To check this setting from the Amazon VPC console, in the navigation pane, choose Subnets. Select the subnet, and choose Actions, Modify auto-assign IP settings.
For more information about working with IPv6 addresses, see IP Addressing in Your VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Step 3: Add a Second Private Subnet
In the previous step, you created a VPC with one public subnet and one private subnet. Use the following procedure to add a second private subnet.
To add a private subnet


In the navigation pane, choose Subnets.


Choose Create Subnet.


For Name tag, enter a name for the private subnet (for example, WorkSpaces Private Subnet 2).


For VPC, select the VPC that you created.


To make an appropriate selection for Availability Zone, see Availability Zones for Amazon WorkSpaces. Make sure you select a different Availability Zone from the one you selected for Step 7 earlier.


For IPv4 CIDR block, enter the CIDR block for the subnet.


Choose Create.


Step 4: Verify and Name the Route Tables
You can verify and name the route tables for each subnet.
To verify and name the route tables


In the navigation pane, choose Subnets, and select the public subnet that you created.


On the Route Table tab, choose the ID of the route table (for example, rtb-12345678).


Select the route table. Under Name, choose the edit icon (the pencil), and enter a name (for example, workspaces-public-routetable), and then choose the check mark to save the name.


On the Routes tab, verify that there is one route for local traffic and another route that sends all other traffic to the internet gateway for the VPC.


In the navigation pane, choose Subnets, and select the first private subnet that you created (for example, WorkSpaces Private Subnet 1).


On the Route Table tab, choose the ID of the route table.


Select the route table. Under Name, choose the edit icon (the pencil), and enter a name (for example, workspaces-private-routetable), and then choose the check mark to save the name.


On the Routes tab, verify that there is one route for local traffic and another route that sends all other traffic to the NAT gateway.


In the navigation pane, choose Subnets, and select the second private subnet that you created (for example, WorkSpaces Private Subnet 2). On the Route Table tab, verify that the route table is the private route table (for example, workspaces-private-routetable). If the route table is different, choose Edit and select this route table.


Configure a VPC with Public Subnets
If you prefer, you can create a VPC with two public subnets. To provide internet access to WorkSpaces in public subnets, configure the directory to assign Elastic IP addresses automatically or manually assign an Elastic IP address to each WorkSpace.
Prerequisites
If you aren't already familiar with working with VPCs and subnets, we recommend reading  VPC and Subnet Sizing for IPv4 in the Amazon VPC User Guide before performing the following tasks.
Topics
 Step 1: Create a VPC
 Step 2: Add a Second Public Subnet
 Step 3: Assign the Elastic IP Address
Step 1: Create a VPC
Create a VPC with one public subnet as follows.
To create the VPC


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose VPC Dashboard in the upper-left corner.


Choose Launch VPC Wizard.


Choose VPC with a Single Public Subnet and then choose Select.


For IPv4 CIDR block, enter the CIDR block for the VPC. We recommend that you use a CIDR block from the private (non-publicly routable) IP address ranges specified in RFC 1918. For example, 10.0.0.0/16. For more information, see VPC and Subnet Sizing for IPv4 in the Amazon VPC User Guide.


For IPv6 CIDR block, keep No IPv6 CIDR Block.


For VPC name, enter a name for the VPC.


For Public subnet's IPv4 CIDR, enter the CIDR block for the subnet. For more information, see VPC and Subnet Sizing for IPv4 in the Amazon VPC User Guide.


To make an appropriate selection for Availability Zone, see Availability Zones for Amazon WorkSpaces.


(Optional) For Subnet name, enter a name for the subnet.


For Service endpoints, do nothing.


For Enable DNS hostnames, keep Yes.


For Hardware tenancy, keep Default.


Choose Create VPC. After the VPC is created, choose OK.


Note
You can associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnets. However, if you configure your subnets to automatically assign IPv6 addresses to instances launched in the subnet, then you cannot use Graphics bundles. (You can use GraphicsPro bundles, however.) This restriction arises from a hardware limitation of previous-generation instance types that do not support IPv6.

For more information about working with IPv6 addresses, see IP Addressing in Your VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Step 2: Add a Second Public Subnet
In the previous step, you created a VPC with one public subnet. Use the following procedure to add a second public subnet and associate it with the route table for the first public subnet, which has a route to the internet gateway for the VPC.
To add a public subnet


In the navigation pane, choose Subnets.


Choose Create Subnet.


For Name tag, enter a name for the subnet.


For VPC, select the VPC that you created.


To make an appropriate selection for Availability Zone, see Availability Zones for Amazon WorkSpaces. Make sure you select a different Availability Zone from the one you selected for Step 9 earlier.


For IPv4 CIDR block, enter the CIDR block for the subnet.


Choose Create. After the subnet is created, choose Close.


Associate the new public subnet with the route table created for the first subnet as follows:


In the navigation pane, choose Subnets.


Select the first subnet.


On the Route Table tab, choose the ID of the route table.


On the Subnet Associations tab, choose Edit subnet associations.


Select the check box for the second subnet (the public subnet you just created) and choose Save.


Step 3: Assign the Elastic IP Address
You can assign  Elastic IP addresses (static public IP addresses) to your WorkSpaces automatically or manually. To use automatic assignment, see Configure Automatic IP Addresses. To assign Elastic IP addresses manually, use the following procedure.
For a video tutorial about how to assign an Elastic IP address to a WorkSpace, see  How do I associate an Elastic IP Address with a WorkSpace? on the AWS Knowledge Center.
Warning
We recommend that you not modify the elastic network interface of the WorkSpace after it is launched. If you have enabled automatic assignment of Elastic IP addresses at the directory level, an Elastic IP address (from the Amazon-provided pool) is assigned to your WorkSpace when it is launched. However, if you associate an Elastic IP address that you own to a WorkSpace, and then you later disassociate that Elastic IP address from the WorkSpace, the WorkSpace loses its public IP address, and it doesn't automatically get a new one from the Amazon-provided pool.
To associate a new public IP address from the Amazon-provided pool with the WorkSpace, you must rebuild the WorkSpace. If you don't want to rebuild the WorkSpace, you must associate another Elastic IP address that you own to the WorkSpace.
To assign an Elastic IP address to a WorkSpace manually


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose WorkSpaces.


Expand the row (choose the arrow icon) for the WorkSpace and note the value of WorkSpace IP. This is the primary private IP address of the WorkSpace.


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs. If you do not have an available Elastic IP address, choose Allocate new address and choose Amazon pool or Owned by me, and then choose Allocate. Make note of the new IP address.


In the navigation pane, choose Network Interfaces.


Select the network interface for your WorkSpace. Note that the value of VPC ID matches the ID of your WorkSpaces VPC and the value of Primary private IPv4 IP matches the primary private IP address of the WorkSpace that you noted earlier.


Choose Actions, Manage IP Addresses. Choose Assign new IP, and then choose Yes, Update. Make note of the new IP address.


Choose Actions, Associate Address.


On the Associate Elastic IP Address page, choose an Elastic IP address from Address. For Associate to private IP address, specify the new private IP address, and then choose Associate Address.
