Register a Directory with Amazon WorkSpaces
To allow Amazon WorkSpaces to use an existing AWS Directory Service directory, you must register it with Amazon WorkSpaces. After you register a directory, you can launch WorkSpaces in the directory.
To register a directory


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose Directories.


Select the directory.


Choose Actions, Register.


Select two subnets that are not from the same Availability Zone.


For Enable Self Service Permissions, choose Yes to enable your users to rebuild their WorkSpaces, change volume size, compute type and running mode. Enabling may impact how much you pay for Amazon WorkSpaces. Choose No otherwise.


For Enable Amazon WorkDocs, choose Yes to register the directory for use with Amazon WorkDocs or No otherwise.
Note
This option is displayed only if Amazon WorkDocs is available in the Region and if you're not using Microsoft Active Directory (AD). If you're using Microsoft AD, finish registering your directory, and then see Enable Amazon WorkDocs for Microsoft Active Directory.


Choose Register. Initially the value of Registered is REGISTERING. After registration is complete, the value is Yes.


When you are finished using the directory with Amazon WorkSpaces, you can deregister it. Note that you must deregister a directory before you can delete it. If you want to deregister and delete a directory, you must first find and remove all the applications and services that are registered to the directory. For more information, see Delete Your Directory in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide.
