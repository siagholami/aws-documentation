Copy a Custom WorkSpaces Image
You can copy a custom WorkSpaces image within or across AWS Regions. Copying an image results in the creation of an identical image with its own unique identifier.
You can copy a Bring Your Own License (BYOL) image to another Region as long as the destination Region is enabled for BYOL. 
There are no additional charges for copying an image across Regions. However, the quota for the number of images in the destination Region applies.
You can copy images one by one using the console. To bulk copy images, use the CopyWorkspaceImage API operation or the copy-workspace-image command in the AWS command line interface (CLI). For more information, see  CopyWorkspaceImage in the Amazon WorkSpaces API Reference or see  copy-workspace-image in the AWS CLI Command Reference.

Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose Images.
