Manage Your Windows WorkSpaces Using Group Policy
You can use Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to apply settings to manage Windows WorkSpaces or users that are part of your Windows WorkSpaces directory.
Note
Linux instances do not adhere to Group Policy. For information about managing Amazon Linux WorkSpaces, see Manage Your Amazon Linux WorkSpaces. 
We recommend that you create an organizational unit for your WorkSpaces Computer Objects and an organizational unit for your WorkSpaces User Objects.
Warning
Group Policy settings can affect the experience of your WorkSpace users as follows:
Some Group Policy settings force users to log off when they are disconnected from a session. Any applications that users have open on their WorkSpaces are closed.
Implementing an interactive logon message to display a logon banner prevents users from being able to access their WorkSpaces. The interactive logon message Group Policy setting is not currently supported by Amazon WorkSpaces.
Disabling removable storage through Group Policy settings causes a login failure that results in users being logged in to temporary user profiles with no access to drive D.
Group Policy settings can be used to restrict drive access. If you configure Group Policy settings to restrict access to drive C or to drive D, users can't access their WorkSpaces. To prevent this issue from occurring, make sure that your users can access drive C and drive D. 
For information about using the Active Directory administration tools to work with GPOs, see Set Up Active Directory Administration Tools for Amazon WorkSpaces.

Install the Group Policy Administrative Template
To use the Group Policy settings that are specific to Amazon WorkSpaces, you must install the Group Policy administrative template. Perform the following procedure on a directory administration WorkSpace or Amazon EC2 instance that is joined to your WorkSpaces directory.
To install the Group Policy administrative template


From a running Windows WorkSpace, make a copy of the pcoip.adm file in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Teradici\PCoIP Agent\configuration directory.


On a directory administration WorkSpace or Amazon EC2 instance that is joined to your WorkSpaces directory, open the Group Policy Management tool (gpmc.msc) and navigate to the organizational unit in your domain that contains your WorkSpaces machine accounts.


Open the context (right-click) menu for the machine account organizational unit and choose Create a GPO in this domain, and link it here.


In the New GPO dialog box, enter a descriptive name for the GPO, such as WorkSpaces Machine Policies, and leave Source Starter GPO set to (none). Choose OK.


Open the context (right-click) menu for the new GPO and choose Edit.


In the Group Policy Management Editor, choose Computer Configuration, Policies, and Administrative Templates. Choose Action, Add/Remove Templates from the main menu. 


In the Add/Remove Templates dialog box, choose Add, select the pcoip.adm file copied previously, and then choose Open, Close.


Close the Group Policy Management Editor. You can now use this GPO to modify the Group Policy settings that are specific to Amazon WorkSpaces.


Configure Printer Support for Windows WorkSpaces
By default, Amazon WorkSpaces enables Basic remote printing, which offers limited printing capabilities because it uses a generic printer driver on the host side to ensure compatible printing.
Advanced remote printing for Windows clients lets you use specific features of your printer, such as double-sided printing, but it requires installation of the matching printer driver on the host side.
Remote printing is implemented as a virtual channel. If virtual channels are disabled, remote printing does not function.
For Windows WorkSpaces, you can use Group Policy settings to configure printer support as needed.
To configure printer support


Make sure that the most recent Amazon WorkSpaces Group Policy administrative template is installed in your domain.


On a directory administration WorkSpace or Amazon EC2 instance that is joined to your WorkSpaces directory, open the Group Policy Management tool (gpmc.msc) and navigate to and select the WorkSpaces GPO for your WorkSpaces machine accounts. Choose Action, Edit in the main menu.

Known Limitation
With clipboard redirection enabled on the WorkSpace, if you copy content that is larger than 890 KB from a Microsoft Office application, the application might become slow or unresponsive for up to 5 seconds.
Set the Session Resume Timeout for Windows WorkSpaces
When using the Amazon WorkSpaces client applications, an interruption of network connectivity causes an active session to be disconnected. This can be caused by events such as closing the laptop lid, or the loss of your wireless network connection. The Amazon WorkSpaces client applications for Windows and macOS attempt to reconnect the session automatically if network connectivity is regained within a certain amount of time. The default session resume timeout is 20 minutes, but you can modify that value for WorkSpaces that are controlled by your domain's Group Policy settings.
To set the automatic session resume timeout value


Make sure that the most recent Amazon WorkSpaces Group Policy administrative template is installed in your domain.


On a directory administration WorkSpace or Amazon EC2 instance that is joined to your WorkSpaces directory, open the Group Policy Management tool (gpmc.msc) and navigate to and select the WorkSpaces GPO for your WorkSpaces machine accounts. Choose Action, Edit in the main menu.


In the Group Policy Management Editor, choose Computer Configuration, Policies, Administrative Templates, Classic Administrative Templates, and PCoIP Session Variables.


To allow the user to override your setting, choose Overridable Administrator Defaults; otherwise, choose Not Overridable Administrator Defaults.


Open the Configure Session Automatic Reconnection Policy setting.


In the Configure Session Automatic Reconnection Policy dialog box, choose Enabled, set the Configure Session Automatic Reconnection Policy option to the desired timeout, in minutes, and choose OK. 


The Group Policy setting change takes effect after the next Group Policy update for the WorkSpace and after the WorkSpace session is restarted. To apply the Group Policy changes, do one of the following:
    Reboot the WorkSpace (in the Amazon WorkSpaces console, select the WorkSpace, then choose Actions, Reboot WorkSpaces).
    From an administrative command prompt, type gpupdate /force.


Disable Time Zone Redirection for Windows WorkSpaces
By default, the time within a Workspace is set to mirror the time zone of the client that is being used to connect to the WorkSpace. This behavior is controlled through time zone redirection. You might want to turn off time zone direction for various reasons: 
 Your company wants all employees to work in a certain time zone (even if some employees are in other time zones).
 You have scheduled tasks in a WorkSpace that are meant to run at a certain time in a specific time zone.
 Your users who travel a lot want to keep their WorkSpaces in one time zone for consistency and personal preference.
If needed for Windows WorkSpaces, you can use Group Policy settings to disable this feature.
To disable time zone redirection


On a directory administration WorkSpace or Amazon EC2 instance that is joined to your WorkSpaces directory, open the Group Policy Management tool (gpmc.msc) and navigate to and select a GPO at the domain or domain controller level of the directory you use for your WorkSpaces. (If you have the Amazon WorkSpaces Group Policy administrative template installed in your domain, you can use the WorkSpaces GPO for your WorkSpaces machine accounts.)


Choose Action, Edit in the main menu.


In the Group Policy Management Editor, choose Computer Configuration, Policies, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, Remote Desktop Services, Remote Desktop Session Host, and Device and Resource Redirection. 


Open the Allow time zone redirection setting.


In the Allow time zone redirection dialog box, choose Disabled, and choose OK.


The Group Policy setting change takes effect after the next Group Policy update for the WorkSpace and after the WorkSpace session is restarted. To apply the Group Policy changes, do one of the following:
    Reboot the WorkSpace (in the Amazon WorkSpaces console, select the WorkSpace, then choose Actions, Reboot WorkSpaces).
    From an administrative command prompt, type gpupdate /force.


Set the time zone for the WorkSpaces to the desired time zone.


The time zone of the WorkSpaces is now static and no longer mirrors the time zone of the client machines. 
Set the Maximum Lifetime for a Kerberos Ticket
If you have not disabled the Remember Me feature of your Windows WorkSpaces, your WorkSpace users can use the Remember Me check box in their WorkSpaces client application to save their credentials. This feature allows users to easily connect to their WorkSpaces while the client application remains running. Their credentials are securely cached up to the maximum lifetime of their Kerberos tickets.
If your WorkSpace uses an AD Connector directory, you can modify the maximum lifetime of the Kerberos tickets for your WorkSpaces users through Group Policy by following the steps in  Maximum Lifetime for a User Ticket in the Microsoft Windows documentation.
To enable or disable the Remember Me feature, see Enable Self-Service WorkSpace Management Capabilities for Your Users.
