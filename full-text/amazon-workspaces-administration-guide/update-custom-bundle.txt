Update a Custom WorkSpaces Bundle
You can update an existing custom WorkSpaces bundle by modifying a WorkSpace that is based on the bundle, creating an image from the WorkSpace, and updating the bundle with the new image. You can then launch new WorkSpaces using the updated bundle.
Important
Existing WorkSpaces aren't automatically updated when you update the bundle that they're based on. To update existing WorkSpaces that are based on a bundle that you've updated, you must either rebuild the WorkSpaces or delete and recreate them.
To update a bundle

Connect to a WorkSpace that is based on the bundle and make the changes that you want. For example, you can apply the latest operating system and application patches and install additional applications.

Alternatively, you can create a new WorkSpace with the same base software package (Plus or Standard) as the image used to create the bundle, and make changes.


If you are still connected to the WorkSpace, disconnect.


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose WorkSpaces.


Select the WorkSpace and choose Actions, Create Image. 


Enter an image name and a description, and then choose Create Image. The WorkSpace is unavailable while the image is being created.


In the navigation pane, choose Bundles.


Select the bundle and choose Actions, Update Bundle.


For Update WorkSpace Bundle, select the image that you created and choose Update Bundle.


As needed, update any existing WorkSpaces that are based on the bundle by rebuilding the WorkSpaces or deleting and recreating them. For more information, see Rebuild a WorkSpace.
