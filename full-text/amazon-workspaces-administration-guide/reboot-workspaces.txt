Restart a WorkSpace
Occasionally, you might need to restart a WorkSpace manually. Restarting a WorkSpace performs a shutdown and reboot of the WorkSpace. To avoid data loss, make sure users save any open documents and other application files before you restart the WorkSpace. The user data, operating system, and system settings are not affected.
Warning
To reboot an encrypted WorkSpace, first make sure that the AWS KMS CMK is enabled; otherwise, the WorkSpace becomes unusable. To determine whether a CMK is enabled, see  Displaying CMK Details in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.
