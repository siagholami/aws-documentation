Update DNS Servers for Amazon WorkSpaces
If you need to update the DNS server IP addresses for your Active Directory after launching your WorkSpaces, you must also update your WorkSpaces with the new DNS server settings.
You can update your WorkSpaces with the new DNS settings in one of the following ways:
 Update the DNS settings on the WorkSpaces before you update the DNS settings for Active Directory.
 Rebuild the WorkSpaces after you update the DNS settings for Active Directory.
We recommend updating the DNS settings on the WorkSpaces before updating the DNS settings in Active Directory (as explained in Step 1 of the following procedure).
If you want to rebuild the WorkSpaces instead, update one of the DNS server IP addresses in your Active Directory (Step 2), and then follow the procedure in Rebuild a WorkSpace to rebuild your WorkSpaces. After you've rebuilt your WorkSpaces, follow the procedure in Step 3 to test your DNS server updates. After completing that step, update the IP address of your second DNS server in Active Directory, and then rebuild your WorkSpaces again. Be sure to follow the procedure in Step 3 to test your second DNS server update. As noted in the  Best Practices section, we recommend updating your DNS server IP addresses one at a time. 
Best Practices
When you're updating your DNS server settings, we recommend the following best practices:
 To avoid disconnections and inaccessibility of domain resources, we strongly recommend performing DNS server updates during off-peak hours or during a planned maintenance period.
 Don't launch any new WorkSpaces during the 15 minutes before and the 15 minutes after changing your DNS server settings.
 When updating your DNS server settings, change one DNS server IP address at a time. Verify that the first update is correct before updating the second IP address. We recommend performing the following procedure (Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3) twice to update the IP addresses one at a time.
Step 1: Update the DNS Server Settings on Your WorkSpaces
In the following procedure, the current and new DNS server IP address values are referred to as follows:
 Current DNS IP addresses: OldIP1, OldIP2
 New DNS IP addresses: NewIP1, NewIP2
Note
 If this is the second time you're performing this procedure, replace OldIP1 with OldIP2 and NewIP1 with NewIP2.
Update the DNS Server Settings for Windows WorkSpaces
If you have multiple WorkSpaces, you can deploy the following registry update to the WorkSpaces by applying a Group Policy Object (GPO) on the Active Directory OU for your WorkSpaces. For more information about working with GPOs, see Manage Your Windows WorkSpaces Using Group Policy.
You can make these updates either by using the Registry Editor or by using Windows PowerShell. Both procedures are described in this section.
To update the DNS registry settings using the Registry Editor


On your Windows WorkSpace, open the Windows search box, and enter registry editor to open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe). 


When asked "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?", choose Yes.


In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following registry entry:


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Amazon\SkyLight


Open the DomainJoinDns registry key. Update OldIP1 with NewIP1, and then choose OK.


Close the Registry Editor.


Reboot the WorkSpace, or restart the service SkyLightWorkspaceConfigService.


Proceed to Step 2, and update your DNS server settings in Active Directory to replace OldIP1 with NewIP1.


To update the DNS registry settings using PowerShell
The following procedure uses PowerShell commands to update your registry and restart the service SkyLightWorkspaceConfigService.


On your Windows WorkSpace, open the Windows search box, and enter powershell. Choose Run as Administrator.


When asked "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?", choose Yes.


In the PowerShell window, run the following command to retrieve the current DNS server IP addresses.


Get-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Amazon\SkyLight -Name DomainJoinDNS
You should receive the following output.
DomainJoinDns : OldIP1,OldIP2
   PSPath        : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Amazon\SkyLight
   PSParentPath  : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Amazon
   PSChildName   : SkyLight
   PSDrive       : HKLM
   PSProvider    : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Registry

In the PowerShell window, run the following command to change OldIP1 to NewIP1. Be sure to leave OldIP2 as is for now.

Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Amazon\SkyLight -Name DomainJoinDNS -Value "NewIP1, OldIP2"

Run the following command to restart the service SkyLightWorkspaceConfigService.

restart-service -Name SkyLightWorkspaceConfigService

Proceed to Step 2, and update your DNS server settings in Active Directory to replace OldIP1 with NewIP1.

Update the DNS Server Settings for Linux WorkSpaces
If you have more than one Linux WorkSpace, we recommend that you use a configuration management solution to distribute and enforce policy. For example, you can use AWS Opsworks for Chef Automate, AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise, or Ansible.
To update the DNS server settings on a Linux WorkSpace


On your Linux WorkSpace, open a Terminal window (Applications > System Tools > MATE Terminal).


Use the following Linux command to edit the /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file. You must have root user privileges to edit this file. Either become root by using the sudo -i command, or execute all commands with sudo as shown.


sudo vi /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
In the /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file, you will see the following prepend command, where OldIP1 and OldIP2 are the IP addresses of your DNS servers.
prepend domain-name-servers OldIP1, OldIP2; # skylight


Replace OldIP1 with NewIP1, and leave OldIP2 as is for now.


Save your changes to /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf.


Reboot the WorkSpace.


Proceed to Step 2, and update your DNS server settings in Active Directory to replace OldIP1 with NewIP1.


Step 2: Update the DNS Server Settings for Active Directory
In this step, you update your DNS server settings for Active Directory. As noted in the Best Practices section, we recommend updating your DNS server IP addresses one at a time.
To update your DNS server settings for Active Directory, see the following documentation in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide:
 AD Connector:  Update the DNS Address for Your AD Connector
 AWS Managed Microsoft AD:  Configure DNS Conditional Forwarders for Your On-premises Domain
 Simple AD:  Configure DNS
After updating your DNS server settings, proceed to Step 3.
Step 3: Test the Updated DNS Server Settings
After completing Step 1 and Step 2, use the following procedure to verify that your updated DNS server settings are working as expected.
In the following procedure, the current and new DNS server IP address values are referred to as follows:
 Current DNS IP addresses: OldIP1, OldIP2
 New DNS IP addresses: NewIP1, NewIP2
Note
If this is the second time you're performing this procedure, replace OldIP1 with OldIP2 and NewIP1 with NewIP2.
Test the Updated DNS Server Settings for Windows WorkSpaces


Shut down the OldIP1 DNS server.


Log in to a Windows WorkSpace.


On the Windows Start menu, choose Windows System, then choose Command Prompt.


Run the following command, where AD_Name is the name of your Active Directory (for example, corp.example.com).


nslookup AD_Name
The nslookup command should return the following output. (If this is the second time you're performing this procedure, you should see NewIP2 in place of OldIP2.)
```
   Server:  Full_AD_Name
   Address:  NewIP1
Name:    AD_Name
   Addresses:  OldIP2
             NewIP1
   ```


If the output is not what you were expecting or if you receive any errors, repeat Step 1.


Wait for an hour and confirm that no user issues have been reported. Verify that NewIP1 is getting DNS queries and responding with answers.


After you've verified that the first DNS server is working properly, repeat Step 1 to update the second DNS server, this time replacing OldIP2 with NewIP2. Then repeat Step 2 and Step 3. 


Test the Updated DNS Server Settings for Linux WorkSpaces


Shut down the OldIP1 DNS server.


Log in to a Linux WorkSpace.


On your Linux WorkSpace, open a Terminal window (Applications > System Tools > MATE Terminal).


The DNS server IP addresses returned in the DHCP response are written to the local /etc/resolv.conf file on the WorkSpace. Run the following command to view the contents of the /etc/resolv.conffile.


cat /etc/resolv.conf
You should see the following output. (If this is the second time you're performing this procedure, you should see NewIP2 in place of OldIP2.)
; This file is generated by Amazon WorkSpaces
   ; Modifying it can make your WorkSpace inaccessible until reboot
   options timeout:2 attempts:5
   ; generated by /usr/sbin/dhclient-script
   search region.compute.internal
   nameserver NewIP1
   nameserver OldIP2
   nameserver WorkSpaceIP
Note
If you make manual modifications to the /etc/resolv.conf file, those changes are lost when the WorkSpace is restarted.


If the output is not what you were expecting or if you receive any errors, repeat Step 1.


The actual DNS server IP addresses are stored in the /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file. To see the contents of this file, run the following command.


sudo cat /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
You should see the following output. (If this is the second time you're performing this procedure, you should see NewIP2 in place of OldIP2.)
# This file is generated by Amazon WorkSpaces
   # Modifying it can make your WorkSpace inaccessible until rebuild
   prepend domain-name-servers NewIP1, OldIP2; # skylight


Wait for an hour and confirm that no user issues have been reported. Verify that NewIP1 is getting DNS queries and responding with answers.


After you've verified that the first DNS server is working properly, repeat Step 1 to update the second DNS server, this time replacing OldIP2 with NewIP2. Then repeat Step 2 and Step 3.
