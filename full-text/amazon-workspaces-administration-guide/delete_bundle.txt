Delete a Custom WorkSpaces Bundle or Image
You can delete unused custom bundles as needed. If you delete a bundle that is being used by a WorkSpace, the bundle is placed in a delete queue and will be deleted after all WorkSpaces that are based on the bundle have been deleted.
To delete a bundle


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose Bundles.


Select the bundle and choose Actions, Delete Bundle.


When prompted for confirmation, choose Delete Bundle.


After you delete a custom bundle, you can delete the image that you used to create or update the bundle.
