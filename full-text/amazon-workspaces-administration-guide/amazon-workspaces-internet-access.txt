Provide Internet Access from Your WorkSpace
Your WorkSpaces must have access to the internet so that you can install updates to the operating system and deploy applications. You can use one of the following options to allow your WorkSpaces in a virtual private cloud (VPC) to access the internet.
Options
 Launch your WorkSpaces in private subnets and configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet in your VPC.
 Launch your WorkSpaces in public subnets and configure automatic assignment of public IP addresses.
 Launch your WorkSpaces in public subnets and manually assign public IP addresses to your WorkSpaces.
For more information, see Configure a VPC for Amazon WorkSpaces.
With any of these options, you must ensure that the security group for your WorkSpaces allows outbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to all destinations (0.0.0.0/0).
Amazon WAM
If you are using Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager (Amazon WAM) to deploy applications to your WorkSpaces, your WorkSpaces must have access to the internet.
Amazon Linux Extras Library
If you are using the Amazon Linux repository, your Amazon Linux WorkSpaces must either have internet access or you must configure VPC endpoints to this repository and to the main Amazon Linux repository. For more information, see the Example: Enabling Access to the Amazon Linux AMI Repositories section in Endpoints for Amazon S3. The Amazon Linux AMI repositories are Amazon S3 buckets in each Region. If you want instances in your VPC to access the repositories through an endpoint, create an endpoint policy that enables access to these buckets. The following policy allows access to the Amazon Linux repositories.
{
  "Statement": [
    {
        "Sid": "AmazonLinux2AMIRepositoryAccess",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::amazonlinux.*.amazonaws.com/*"
        ]
    }
  ]
