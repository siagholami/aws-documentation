Supported Network Hardware
To use the AWS Snowball Edge device, you need your own network cables. For RJ45 cables, there are no specific recommendations. SFP and QSFP cables and modules from Mellanox and Finisar have been verified to be compatible with the device.
After you open the back panel of the AWS Snowball Edge device, you see the network ports shown in the following photograph.

These ports support the following network hardware.
SFP
This port provides a 10G/25G SFP28 interface compatible with SFP28 and SFP transceiver modules and direct-attach copper (DAC) cables. You need to provide your own transceivers or DAC cables.
 For 10G operation, you can use any SFP option. Examples include:
   10Gbase-LR (single mode fiber) transceiver
   10Gbase-SR (multi-mode fiber) transceiver
   SFP DAC cable
 For 25G operation, you can use any SFP28 option. Examples include:
   25Gbase-LR (single mode fiber) transceiver
   25Gbase-SR (multi-mode fiber) transceiver
   SFP28 DAC cable

QSFP
This port provides a 40G QSFP interface on storage optimized devices and a 40/50/100G QSFP interface on compute optimized devices. Both are compatible with QSFP transceiver modules and DAC cables. You need to provide your own transceivers or DAC cables. Examples include the following:
 40Gbase-LR4 (single mode fiber) transceiver
 40Gbase-SR4 (multi-mode fiber) transceiver
 QSFP DAC

RJ45
This port provides 1Gbase-TX/10Gbase-TX operation. It is connected via UTP cable terminated with an RJ45 connector. Compute optimized devices have two RJ45 ports.
1G operation is indicated by a blinking amber light. 1G operation is not recommended for large-scale data transfers to the Snowball Edge device, as it dramatically increases the time it takes to transfer data.
10G operation is indicated by a blinking green light. It requires a Cat6A UTP cable with a maximum operating distance of 180 feet (55 meters).
