This guide is for the Snowball Edge. If you are looking for documentation for the Snowball, see the AWS Snowball User Guide.

AWS Snowball Edge Quotas
Following, you can find information about limitations on using the AWS Snowball Edge device.
Important
When you transfer data into Amazon Simple Storage Service using a Snowball Edge, keep in mind that individual Amazon S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes (TB).
Region Availability for AWS Snowball
The AWS Snowball service has two device types, the standard Snowball and the Snowball Edge. The following table highlights which of these devices are available in which regions. 
Note
The guide you're reading now is for the Snowball Edge, which has 100 TB of storage space. If you are looking for documentation for the Snowball, see the AWS Snowball User Guide.

Limitations AWS Snowball Edge Jobs
The following limitations exist for creating AWS Snowball Edge device jobs:
 For security purposes, data transfers must be completed within 360 days of the AWS Snowball Edge device being prepared.
 Currently, AWS Snowball Edge device doesn't support server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C). AWS Snowball Edge device does support server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) and server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service–managed keys (SSE-KMS). For more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
 If you're using AWS Snowball Edge device to import data, and you need to transfer more data than will fit on a single AWS Snowball Edge device, create additional jobs. Each export job can use multiple AWS Snowball Edge devices.
 The default service limit for the number of AWS Snowball Edge devices you can have at one time is 1. If you want to increase your service limit or create a cluster job, contact AWS Support.
 Metadata for objects transferred to a device is not persisted, unless it's transferred with the file interface. The only metadata that remains the same is filename and filesize. All other metadata is set as in the following example: -rw-rw-r-- 1 root root [filesize] Dec 31 1969 [path/filename]
Limitations on Transferring On-Premises Data with an AWS Snowball Edge Device
The following limitations exist for transferring data to or from a AWS Snowball Edge device on-premises:
 Files must be in a static state while being written. Files that are modified while they are being transferred will not be imported into Amazon S3.
 Jumbo frames are not supported—that is, Ethernet frames with more than 1500 bytes of payload.
 When selecting what data to export, keep in mind that objects with trailing slashes in their names (/ or \) will not be transferred. Before exporting any objects with trailing slashes, update their names to remove the slash.
 When using the Amazon S3 Adapter for Snowball with the AWS CLI to transfer data, note that the --recursive option for the cp command is only supported for uploading data to an AWS Snowball Edge device, not for downloading data from a AWS Snowball Edge device.
 When using multipart data transfer, the maximum part size is 512 megabytes (MB).
Limitations for Lambda Powered by AWS IoT Greengrass
If you allocate the minimum recommendation of 128 MB of memory for each of your functions, you can have up to seven Lambda functions in a single job. This limitation occurs because the physical nature of the Snowball Edge limits the amount of memory available for running Lambda functions on the device. 
Limitations on Shipping an AWS Snowball Edge
The following limitations exist for shipping a AWS Snowball Edge device:
 AWS will not ship a AWS Snowball Edge device to a post office box.
 AWS will not ship a AWS Snowball Edge device between non-US regions—for example, from EU (Ireland) to EU (Frankfurt), or to Asia Pacific (Sydney).
 Moving a AWS Snowball Edge device to an address outside of the country specified when the job was created is not allowed and is a violation of the AWS Service Terms.
For more information on shipping, see Shipping Considerations for AWS Snowball.
Limitations on Processing Your Returned AWS Snowball Edge for Import
To import your data into AWS, the device must meet the following requirements:
 The AWS Snowball Edge device must not be compromised. Except for opening the three doors on the front, back, and top, or to add and replace the optional air filter, don't open the AWS Snowball Edge device for any reason.
 The device must not be physically damaged. You can prevent damage by closing the three doors on the AWS Snowball Edge device until the latches make an audible clicking sound.
 The AWS Snowball Edge device's E Ink display must be visible, and must show the return label that was automatically generated when you finished transferring your data onto the AWS Snowball Edge device.
Note
All AWS Snowball Edge devices returned that do not meet these requirements are erased without work performed on them.
