This guide is for the Snowball Edge. If you are looking for documentation for the Snowball, see the AWS Snowball User Guide.

Using an AWS Snowball Edge Device
Following, you can find an overview of the AWS Snowball Edge device, the physically rugged device protected by AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) that you'll use for local storage and compute, or to transfer data between your on-premises servers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
For information on unlocking an AWS Snowball Edge device, see Using the Snowball Client.
When the device first arrives, inspect it for damage or obvious tampering.
Warning
If you notice anything that looks suspicious about the device, don't connect it to your internal network. Instead, contact AWS Support, and a new one will be shipped to you.
The following image shows what the AWS Snowball Edge device looks like.

It has three doors, a front, a back, and a top that all can be opened by latches. The top door contains the power cable for the device. The other two doors can be opened and slid inside the device so they're out of the way while you're using it. By opening the doors, you get access to the LCD E Ink display embedded in the front side of the device, and the power and network ports in the back.
Once your device arrives and is powered on, you're ready to use it.
