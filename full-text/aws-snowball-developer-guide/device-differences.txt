AWS Snowball Device Differences
The Snowball and the Snowball Edge are two different devices. This guide is for the Snowball Edge. If you are looking for documentation for the Snowball, see the AWS Snowball User Guide. Both devices allow you to move huge amounts of data into and out of Amazon S3, they both have the same job management API, and they both use the same console. However, the two devices differ in hardware specifications, some features, what transfer tools are used, and price.
Snowball Edge Device Options
Snowball Edge devices have the following options for device configurations:
 Snowball Edge Storage Optimized (for data transfer) – This Snowball Edge device option has a 100 TB (80 TB usable) storage capacity. 
 Snowball Edge Storage Optimized (with EC2 compute functionality) – This Snowball Edge device option has up to 80 TB of usable storage space, 24 vCPUs, and 32 GiB of memory for compute functionality. It also comes with 1 TB of additional SSD storage space for block volumes attached to Amazon EC2 AMIs.
 Snowball Edge Compute Optimized – This Snowball Edge device option has the most compute functionality, with 52 vCPUs, 208 GiB of memory, and 42 TB (39.5 usable) plus 7.68 TB of dedicated NVMe SSD for compute instances for block storage volumes for EC2 compute instances, and 42 TB of HDD capacity for either object storage or block storage volumes.
 Snowball Edge Compute Optimized with GPU – This Snowball Edge device option is identical to the compute optimized option, save for an installed GPU, equivalent to the one available in the P3 Amazon EC2 instance type. It has a storage capacity of 42 TB (39.5 TB of HDD storage that can be used for a combination of Amazon S3 compatible object storage and Amazon EBS compatible block storage volumes) plus 7.68 TB of dedicated NVMe SSD for compute instances.
For more information about the compute functionality of these three options, see Using Amazon EC2 Compute Instances.
Note
When this guide refers to Snowball Edge devices, it's referring to all optional variants of the device. Whenever specific information applies only to one or more optional configurations of devices, like how the Snowball Edge Compute Optimized with GPU option has an on-board GPU peripheral, it is mentioned explicitly.
The following table summarizes the differences between the various device options. For hardware specification information, see AWS Snowball Edge Specifications.
