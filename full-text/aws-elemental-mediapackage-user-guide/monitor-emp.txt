(Optional) Step 4: Monitor AWS Elemental MediaPackage Activity
Use Amazon CloudWatch to track AWS Elemental MediaPackage activity, such as the counts of bytes that MediaPackage has received and sent, response times, and request counts. Metrics are grouped first by the service namespace, and then by the various dimension combinations within each namespace.
To view metrics using the CloudWatch console


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Metrics.


Under All metrics, choose the AWS/MediaPackage namespace.


Select the metric dimension to view the metrics (for example, choose channel to view metrics per channel).
