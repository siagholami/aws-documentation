DASH Manifest Options in AWS Elemental MediaPackage
This section describes the options that AWS Elemental MediaPackage offers for modifying live output DASH manifests. These options don't apply to video on demand (VOD) outputs or harvested live-to-VOD assets.
Default DASH manifest
The following is a truncated example of a DASH manifest with no treatments:
<MPD>
  <Period>  
    <AdaptationSet>  
      <Representation> 
        <SegmentTemplate> 
          <SegmentTimeline> 
            <S /> 
          </SegmentTimeline>
        </SegmentTemplate>
      </Representation>
    </AdaptationSet>
    .
    .
  </Period>
</MPD>
The elements of the DASH manifest are nested within the MPD (media presentation description) object. These are the elements of the manifest:
 Period: The entire manifest is nested in one period.
 AdaptationSet: An AdaptationSet groups together representations of the same type (video, audio, or captions). There are one or more AdaptationSets in the Period.
 Representation: A Representation describes an audio, video, or captions track. There are one or more Representations in each AdaptationSet. Each representation is a track.
 SegmentTemplate: A SegmentTemplate defines properties of the representation, such as the timescale and access URLs for media and initialization segments. There is one SegmentTemplate for each Representation.
 SegmentTimeline: A SegmentTimeline describes when each segment is available for playback. There is one SegmentTimeline for each SegmentTemplate.
 S: An S describes when the segment is available (t value), the duration of the segment (d value), and a count of how many additional consecutive segments have this same duration (r value). There are one or more segments in the SegmentTimeline. 
AWS Elemental MediaPackage can modify how some of these elements are presented in the output manifest. You can use the following treatment options on the output live manifest:
 Separate the manifest into multiple periods, to allow ad breaks. See DASH Manifest Options in AWS Elemental MediaPackageMulti-period DASH in AWS Elemental MediaPackage.
 Reduce the length of the manifest to make processing and playback more efficient. See Compacted DASH Manifests.
 Control what segment information is used in the media URL in the SegmentTemplate properties. See DASH Manifest Segment Template Format.
