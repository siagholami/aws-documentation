AWS Elemental MediaPackage uses the following resources for live content:
 Channels are the entry point for your live streams from upstream encoders.
For supported live inputs and codecs, see Live Supported Codecs and Input Types.
 Endpoints tell AWS Elemental MediaPackage how to package outbound content. Endpoints are associated with channels and hold encryption, stream, and packaging settings.
