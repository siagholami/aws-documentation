Asset Access Fields
The following fields describe how AWS Elemental MediaPackage accesses the source content in your Amazon S3 bucket. MediaPackage must have permissions to access the bucket. To create an IAM role with the right permissions, see Allowing AWS Elemental MediaPackage to Access Other AWS Services.
*Amazon S3 bucket name
The Amazon S3 bucket holds the source content that AWS Elemental MediaPackage ingests and packages for playback. Do one of the following:
 To choose from a list of buckets that MediaPackage has detected in your account, choose Use existing bucket and choose the bucket.
Note
If you don't have permissions to view Amazon S3 buckets, MediaPackage doesn't display any options. Contact your AWS administrator or enter the bucket name manually in the Specify bucket name field.
 To use a bucket that MediaPackage hasn't detected, choose Specify bucket name* and enter the name of the bucket. MediaPackage doesn't have visibility into this bucket, so it can't tell if the bucket is compatible or not.
*IAM role
The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides AWS Elemental MediaPackage permissions to read from the Amazon S3 bucket. Do one of the following:
 To choose from a list of roles that MediaPackage has detected on your account, choose Use existing role and choose the role.
Note
If you don't have permissions to view IAM roles, AWS Elemental MediaPackage doesn't display any options. Contact your AWS administrator or enter the role ARN manually in the Specify custom role name field.
 To use a role that MediaPackage hasn't detected, choose Specify custom role name* and enter the ARN of the role. Because MediaPackage doesn't have visibility into this role, it can't tell if the role provides the correct permissions or not.
