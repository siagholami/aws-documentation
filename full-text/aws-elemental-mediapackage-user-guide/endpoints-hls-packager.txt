Packager Settings Fields


For Type, choose Apple HLS.


(Optional) For Segment duration, type the duration (in seconds) of each segment. If the value that you type here is different from the input segment size, AWS Elemental MediaPackage rounds segments to the nearest multiple of the input segment duration.


(Optional) For Playlist window duration, type the total duration (in seconds) of the manifest.


(Optional) To group all audio tracks into a single HLS rendition group, select Use audio rendition group. For more information about rendition groups, see Rendition Groups Reference in AWS Elemental MediaPackage.


(Optional) In stream sets with a single video track, to include an additional I-frame only stream along with the other tracks in the manifest, select Include IFrame only stream. MediaPackage inserts EXT-I-FRAMES-ONLY tags in the manifest, and then compiles and includes an I-frames only playlist in the stream. This playlist enables player functionality like fast forward and rewind.


(Optional) To include EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags in the output manifest, select Program date/time interval, and then type the interval for MediaPackage to insert the tags in the manifest.


The EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag holds the time of the segment. When program date time (PDT) information is available in the source content, MediaPackage uses this same information on the output content. Otherwise, MediaPackage uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the PDT.
The PDT information helps downstream players to synchronize the stream to the wall clock, enabling functionality like viewer seek in the playback timeline and time display on the player.
SCTE-35 Options
The following fields dictate how MediaPackage processes SCTE-35 messages from the input stream. For more information, see SCTE-35 Message Options in AWS Elemental MediaPackage.

(Optional) In Ad markers, choose how ad markers are included in the packaged content. 

Choose from the following:
    None – Omit all SCTE-35 ad markers from the output.
    SCTE-35 enhanced – Generate ad markers and blackout tags based on the SCTE-35 input messages from the input source.
    Passthrough – Copy the SCTE-35 ad markers directly from the input HLS input manifest to the output manifest.


(Optional) To add or remove SCTE-35 message types that MediaPackage treats as ads, choose Customize ad triggers. If you don't make a selection here, MediaPackage inserts ad markers in the output manifest based on these message types:
    Splice insert
    Provider advertisement
    Distributor advertisement
    Provider placement opportunity
    Distributor placement opportunity


(Optional) To change what ad insertion action MediaPackage takes based on delivery restriction flags in the segmentation descriptors of SCTE-35 messages, choose Ads on delivery restrictions. These are the available options:
    None – MediaPackage doesn't insert any ad markers in the output manifest.
    Restricted – MediaPackage inserts ad markers when there are delivery restrictions in the SCTE-35 message types that you indicated in Customize ad triggers.
    Unrestricted – MediaPackage inserts ad markers when there aren't delivery restrictions in the SCTE-35 message types that you indicated in Customize ad triggers.
    Both – MediaPackage inserts ad markers whether or not there are delivery restrictions in the SCTE-35 message types that you indicated in Customize ad triggers.
