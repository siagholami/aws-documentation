If you exceed the quotas for your account when you're creating a packaging configuration, you get an error. If you get an error similar to Too many requests, please try again. Resource limit exceeded, either you have exceeded the API request quota, or you have already reached the maximum number of packaging groups allowed on your account.If this is your first group, or if you think you mistakenly received this error, use the Service Quotas console to request quota increases.
