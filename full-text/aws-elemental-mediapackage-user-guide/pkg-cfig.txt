Working with Packaging Configurations in AWS Elemental MediaPackage
A packaging configuration defines a single delivery point for an asset. The configuration holds all of the information that's needed for AWS Elemental MediaPackage to integrate with a player or content delivery network (CDN), such as Amazon CloudFront. The configuration outputs content in one of the available stream formats:
 Apple HLS – Packages content to Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) 
 Microsoft Smooth – Packages content for Microsoft Smooth Streaming players
 Common Media Application Format (CMAF) – Packages content to devices that support Apple HLS fragmented MP4 (fMP4)
 DASH-ISO – Packages content for the DASH-ISO ABR streaming protocol
The packaging configuration also holds information about digital rights management (DRM) and encryption integration, bitrate presentation order, and more.
