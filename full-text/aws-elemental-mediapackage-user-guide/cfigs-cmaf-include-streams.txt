Stream Selection Fields
Limit which incoming bitrates are available for playback and sort the streams in the output of an asset that uses this packaging configuration. 
The minimum and maximum values take into account only the video bitrates. If the video bitrate is below the minimum specified rate, it is not included in the output, regardless of the sum of the bitrates for other tracks. Likewise, if the video bitrate is below the maximum specified rate, it is included in the output, regardless of the sum of the bitrates for other tracks.
To set minimum and maximum bitrates and sort the output, choose Stream selection and complete the additional fields as follows:


(Optional) For Bitrate order, choose from the following:
    Original to sort the output streams in the same order that the incoming source uses.
    Ascending to sort the output streams starting with the lowest bitrate and ending with the highest.
    Descending to sort the output streams starting with the highest bitrate and ending with the lowest.


(Optional) To ensure tracks are at least a certain bitrate, choose Min video bitrate and enter the minimum bitrate threshold that video tracks must meet to be available for playback from this endpoint.


(Optional) To ensure tracks are no more than a certain bitrate, choose Max video bitrate and enter the maximum bitrate threshold that video tracks must meet to be available for playback from this endpoint.
