Step 3: Create Endpoints
The endpoint is attached to a channel, and represents the output of the live content. You can associate multiple endpoints to a single channel. Each endpoint gives players and downstream CDNs (such as Amazon CloudFront) access to the content for playback. 
AWS Elemental MediaPackage does not require that you supply any customer data. There are no fields in endpoints where there is an expectation that you will provide customer data.
To create an endpoint


On the Channels page, choose the channel that the endpoint will be associated with.


On the details page for the channel, choose either Add and edit endpoint or Add endpoints if there are no existing endpoints.


For ID, enter a name that describes the endpoint, such as HLSendpoint1. The ID is the primary identifier for the endpoint, and must be unique for your account in the AWS Region. Supported characters are letters, numbers, underscore (_), and dash (-). You can't use spaces in the ID.


Keep the defaults for the remaining fields, and then choose Save endpoints.


MediaPackage displays the channel's details page, including the endpoint that you just created.

On the channel's details page, note the value in the URL field for the endpoint. Provide this information to the person in charge of the downstream device (CDN or player). In the downstream device, this person must enter the request destination as the endpoint's URL.
