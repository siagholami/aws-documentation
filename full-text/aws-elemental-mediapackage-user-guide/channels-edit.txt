Editing a Channel
Edit a channel's description for easier identification later. You can edit the description on a channel or enable Amazon CloudFront distribution creation from the AWS Elemental MediaPackage console. For information about creating a distribution from AWS Elemental MediaPackage, see Creating a Distribution from AWS Elemental MediaPackage.
Note
To make changes to an existing distribution (even if it was created from AWS Elemental MediaPackage), go to the Amazon CloudFront console.
You can use the AWS Elemental MediaPackage console, the AWS CLI, or the MediaPackage API to edit a channel. For information about editing a channel through the AWS CLI or MediaPackage API, see the AWS Elemental MediaPackage API Reference.
When you're editing a channel, do not put sensitive identifying information like customer account numbers into free-form fields such as the Name field. This includes when you work with AWS Elemental MediaPackage using the console, REST API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Any data that you enter into MediaPackage might get picked up for inclusion in diagnostic logs or Amazon CloudWatch Events.
