Delete a trigger from a CodeDeploy deployment group
Because there is a limit of 10 triggers per deployment group, you might want to delete triggers if they are no longer being used. You cannot undo the deletion of a trigger, but you can re-create one.

Delete a trigger from a deployment group (CLI)
To use the CLI to delete a trigger, call the update-deployment-group command, with empty trigger configuration parameters, specifying:
 The name of the application associated with the deployment group. To view a list of application names, call the list-applications command.
 The name of the deployment group associated with the application. To view a list of deployment group names, call the list-deployment-groups command.
For example:
aws deploy update-deployment-group --application-name application-name --current-deployment-group-name deployment-group-name --trigger-configurations
