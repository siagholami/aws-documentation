Create a deployment group for an EC2/On-Premises blue/green deployment (console)
To use the CodeDeploy console to create a deployment group for a blue/green deployment:
Warning
Do not follow these steps if:
You do not have instances with the CodeDeploy agent installed that you want to replace during the blue/green deployment process. To set up your instances, follow the instructions in Working with instances for CodeDeploy, and then follow the steps in this topic.
You want to create an application that uses a custom deployment configuration, but you have not yet created the deployment configuration. Follow the instructions in Create a deployment configuration with CodeDeploy, and then follow the steps in this topic. 
You do not have a service role that trusts CodeDeploy with, at minimum, the trust and permissions described in Step 3: Create a service role for CodeDeploy. To create and configure a service role, follow the instructions in Step 3: Create a service role for CodeDeploy, and then follow the steps in this topic.
You have not created a Classic Load Balancer or an Application Load Balancer in Elastic Load Balancing for the registration of the instances in your replacement environment. For more information, see Set up a load balancer in Elastic Load Balancing for CodeDeploy Amazon EC2 deployments.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy.
Note
Sign in with the same account or IAM user information that you used in Getting started with CodeDeploy.


In the navigation pane, expand Deploy, and then choose Applications.


On the Applications page, choose the name of the application for which you want to create a deployment group.


On your application page, from the Deployment groups tab, choose Create deployment group.


In Deployment group name, enter a name that describes the deployment group.
Note
If you want to use the same settings used in another deployment group (including the deployment group name, tags, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group names, and the deployment configuration), choose those settings on this page. Although this new deployment group and the existing deployment group have the same name, CodeDeploy treats them as separate deployment groups, because they are associated with separate applications.


In Service role, choose a service role that grants CodeDeploy access to your target instance.


In Deployment type choose Blue/green.


In Environment configuration, choose the method to use to provide instances for your replacement environment:


Automatically copy Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group: CodeDeploy creates an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group by copying one you specify.


Manually provision instances: You won't specify the instances for your replacement environment until you create a deployment. You must create the instances before you start the deployment. Instead, here you specify the instances you want to replace.


In Agent configuration with AWS Systems Manager, specify how you would like to install and update the CodeDeploy agent on the instances in your deployment group. For more information on the CodeDeploy agent, see Working with the CodeDeploy agent. For more information about AWS Systems Manager, see What is AWS Systems Manager?


Never: Skip configuring the CodeDeploy installation with AWS Systems Manager. Instances must have the agent installed to be used in deployments, so only choose this option if you will install the CodeDeploy agent another way.


Only once: AWS Systems Manager will install the CodeDeploy agent once on every instance in your deployment group.


Now and schedule updates: AWS Systems Manager will create an association with State Manager that installs the CodeDeploy agent on the schedule you configure. For more information about State Manager and associations, see About State Manager.


Depending on your choice in step 8, do one of the following:
    If you chose Automatically copy Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group: In Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, choose or enter the name of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group you want to use as a template for the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group that is created for the instances in your replacement environment. The number of currently healthy instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group you select is created in your replacement environment.
    If you chose Manually provision instances: Select Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling intances, or both to specify instances to add to this deployment group. Enter Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tag values or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group names to identify the instances in your original environment (that is, the instances you want to replace or that are running the current application revision). 


(Optional) In Load balancer, select Enable load balancing, and then choose an existing Classic Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer to manage traffic to the instances during the deployment processes.


Each instance is deregistered from the load balancer (Classic Load Balancers) or target group (Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers) to prevent traffic from being routed to it during the deployment. It is re-registered when the deployment is complete.
For more information about load balancers for CodeDeploy deployments, see Integrating CodeDeploy with Elastic Load Balancing.

In Deployment settings, review the default options for rerouting traffic to the replacement environment, which deployment configuration to use for the deployment, and how instances in the original environment are handled after the deployment.

If you want to change the settings, continue to the next step. Otherwise, skip to step 13.


To change the deployment settings for the blue/green deployment, choose any of the following settings.  
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


(Optional) In Advanced, configure options you want to include in the deployment, such as Amazon SNS notification triggers, Amazon CloudWatch alarms, or automatic rollbacks.


For information about specifying advanced options in deployment groups, see Configure advanced options for a deployment group. 

Choose Create deployment group.
