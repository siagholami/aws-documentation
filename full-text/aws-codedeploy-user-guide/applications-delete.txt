Delete an application in CodeDeploy
You can use the CodeDeploy console, the AWS CLI, or a CodeDeploy API action to delete applications. For information about using the CodeDeploy API action, see DeleteApplication.
Warning
Deleting an application removes information about the application from the CodeDeploy system, including all related deployment group information and deployment details. Deleting an application created for an EC2/On-Premises deployment does not remove any application revisions from instances nor does it delete revisions from Amazon S3 buckets. Deleting an application created for an EC2/On-Premises deployment does not terminate any Amazon EC2 instances or deregister any on-premises instances. This action cannot be undone.
