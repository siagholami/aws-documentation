CodeDeploy permissions reference
Use the following table when you are setting up access and writing permissions policies that you can attach to an IAM identity (identity-based policies). The table lists each CodeDeploy API operation, the actions for which you can grant permissions to perform the action, and the format of the resource ARN to use for granting permissions. You specify the actions in the policy's Action field. You specify an ARN, with or without a wildcard character (*), as the resource value in the policy's Resource field.
You can use AWS-wide condition keys in your CodeDeploy policies to express conditions. For a complete list of AWS-wide keys, see Available keys in the IAM User Guide.
To specify an action, use the codedeploy: prefix followed by the API operation name (for example, codedeploy:GetApplication and codedeploy:CreateApplication). To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas (for example, "Action": ["codedeploy:action1", "codedeploy:action2"]).
Using Wildcard Characters
You can use a wildcard character (*) in your ARN to specify multiple actions or resources. For example, codedeploy:* specifies all CodeDeploy actions and codedeploy:Get* specifies all CodeDeploy actions that begin with the word Get. The following example grants access to all deployment groups with names that begin with West and are associated with applications that have names beginning with Test. 
arn:aws:codedeploy:us-west-2:80398EXAMPLE:deploymentgroup:Test*/West*
You can use wildcards with the following resources listed in the table:
 application-name
 deployment-group-name
 deployment-configuration-name
 instance-ID
Wildcards can't be used with region or account-id. For more information about wildcards, see IAM identifiers in IAM User Guide. 
Note
 In the ARN for each action, a colon (:) follows the resource. You can also follow the resource with a forward slash (/). For more information, see CodeDeploy example ARNs. 
Use the scroll bars to see the rest of the table.
