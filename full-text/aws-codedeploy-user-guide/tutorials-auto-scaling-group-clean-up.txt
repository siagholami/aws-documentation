To clean up resources (CLI)

Delete the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group by calling the delete-auto-scaling-group command against CodeDeployDemo-AS-Group. This will also terminate the Amazon EC2 instances. 

aws autoscaling delete-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name CodeDeployDemo-AS-Group --force-delete

Optionally, delete the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launch configuration by calling the delete-launch-configuration command against the launch configuration named CodeDeployDemo-AS-Configuration:

aws autoscaling delete-launch-configuration --launch-configuration-name CodeDeployDemo-AS-Configuration

Optionally, delete the application from CodeDeploy by calling the delete-application command against the application named SimpleDemoApp. This will also delete all associated deployment, deployment group, and revision records. 

aws deploy delete-application --application-name SimpleDemoApp

To delete the Systems Manager State Manager association, call the delete-association command.

aws ssm delete-association --assocation-id association-id
You can get the association-id by calling the describe-association command.
aws ssm describe-association --name AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage --targets Key=tag:Name,Values=CodeDeployDemo
