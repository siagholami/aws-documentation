Working with application revisions for CodeDeploy
In CodeDeploy, a revision contains a version of the source files CodeDeploy will deploy to your instances or scripts CodeDeploy will run on your instances. 
You plan the revision, add an AppSpec file to the revision, and then push the revision to Amazon S3 or GitHub. After you push the revision, you can deploy it.
