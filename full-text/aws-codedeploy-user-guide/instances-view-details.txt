To view instance details:


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy.
Note
Sign in with the same account or IAM user information that you used in Getting started with CodeDeploy.


In the navigation pane, expand Deploy, and then choose Deployments.
Note
If no entries are displayed, make sure the correct region is selected. On the navigation bar, in the region selector, choose one of the regions listed in Region and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference. CodeDeploy is supported in these regions only.


To display deployment details, choose the deployment ID for the instance. 


You can view all instances in the Instance activity section of the deployment's page. 


To see information about individual deployment lifecycle events for an instance, on the deployment details page, in the Events column, choose View events. 
Note
If Failed is displayed for any of the lifecycle events, on the instance details page, choose View logs, View in EC2, or both. You can find troubleshooting tips in Troubleshoot instance issues.


If you want to see more information about an Amazon EC2 instance, choose the ID of the instance in the Instance ID column.


View instance details (CLI)
To use the AWS CLI to view instance details, call either the get-deployment-instance command or the list-deployment-instances command.
To view details about a single instance, call the get-deployment-instance command, specifying: 
 The unique deployment ID. To get the deployment ID, call the list-deployments command.
 The unique instance ID. To get the instance ID, call the list-deployment-instances command.
To view a list of IDs for instances used in a deployment, call the list-deployment-instances command, specifying:
 The unique deployment ID. To get the deployment ID, call the list-deployments command.
 Optionally, whether to include only specific instance IDs by their deployment status. (If not specified, all matching instance IDs will be listed, regardless of their deployment status.)
