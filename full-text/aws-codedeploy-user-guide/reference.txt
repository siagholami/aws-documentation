Applications









Maximum number of applications associated with an AWS account in a single region
1000


Maximum number of characters in an application name
100


Characters allowed in an application name
Letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_),  (plus signs), = (equals signs), , (commas), @ (at signs), - (minus signs).


Maximum number of applications that can be passed to the BatchGetApplications API action
100


Maximum number of GitHub connection tokens for a single AWS account
25



Application revisions









Maximum number of characters in an application revision name
100


Allowed file types for EC2/On-Premises application revisions
Archive files with the extension .zip or .tar and compressed archive files with the extension .tar.gz. An archive or compressed archive file that is compatible with CodeDeploy must contain a single application specification file (AppSpec file) with the file name appspec.yml.


Allowed file types for AWS Lambda and Amazon ECSapplication revisions
A single AppSpec file with the file name appspec.yaml, or a compressed file with the extension .zip or .tar.gz that contains a single AppSpec file with the file name appspec.yaml.



Deployments









Maximum number of concurrent deployments to a deployment group¹
1


Maximum number of concurrent deployments associated with an AWS account²
100


Maximum number of hours an EC2/On-Premises in-place deployment can run
8


Maximum number of hours between the deployment of a revision and the shifting of traffic to the replacement environment during an EC2/On-Premises or Amazon ECS blue/green deployment
48


Maximum number of hours between the completion of a deployment and the termination of the original environment during an EC2/On-Premises or Amazon ECS blue/green deployment
48


Maximum number of hours an EC2/On-Premises blue/green deployment can run
109 (48 for each of the above two limits) plus one hour for each of 13 possible lifecycle events


Maximum number of hours an AWS Lambda deployment can run
50 (48 hours for the maximum time between the first and last traffic shift plus one hour for each of two possible lifecycle hooks)


Maximum number of seconds until a deployment lifecycle event fails if not completed
3600


Maximum number of characters in a deployment description
256


Maximum number of deployments that can be passed to the BatchGetDeployments API action
100


Maximum number of minutes until a deployment fails if a lifecycle event doesn't start after: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]
5


Maximum number of minutes a blue/green deployment can wait after a successful deployment before terminating instances from the original deployment
2800


Maximum number of listeners on a traffic route during an Amazon ECS deployment
1


¹ This limit is intended to prevent accidental, concurrent deployments of the same application to the same deployment group. ² Each deployment to a scaled-up Amazon EC2 instance in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group counts as a single concurrent deployment. If the scaled-up Amazon EC2 instance is associated with multiple applications, then additional concurrent deployment for each application would be generated. For example, an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group that scales up by five Amazon EC2 instances and is associated with a single application would generate five concurrent deployments. If the same five scaled-up Amazon EC2 instances are associated with two additional applications, this would generate ten additional concurrent deployments.




Deployment configurations









Maximum number of custom deployment configurations associated with an AWS account
25


Allowed values for a minimum healthy instances setting of HOST_COUNT
Any positive integer or 0 (zero). Zero (0) results in deployment to all instances at once.


Allowed values for a minimum healthy instances setting of FLEET_PERCENT
Any positive integer less than 100 or 0 (zero). Zero (0) results in deployment to all instances at once.


Maximum number of characters in a custom deployment configuration name
100


Characters allowed in a custom deployment configuration name
Letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_),  (plus signs), = (equals signs), , (commas), @ (at signs), - (minus signs).


Disallowed prefixes in a custom deployment configuration name
CodeDeployDefault.


Maximum number of minutes between the first and last traffic shift during an AWS Lambda canary or linear deployment
2880


Maximum percentage of traffic that can be shifted in one increment during an AWS Lambda deployment that uses a canary or linear deployment configuration.
99



Deployment groups









Maximum number of deployment groups associated with a single application
1000


Maximum number of tags in a deployment group
10


Maximum number of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups in a deployment group
10


Maximum number of characters in a deployment group name
100


Characters allowed in a deployment group name
Letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_),  (plus signs), = (equals signs), , (commas), @ (at signs), - (minus signs).


Maximum number of event notification triggers in a deployment group
10


Maximum number of deployment groups that can be associated with an Amazon ECS service
1



Instances









Maximum number of instances in a single deployment
500


Maximum number of characters in a tag key
128


Maximum number of characters in a tag value
256


Maximum number of instances that can be passed to the BatchGetOnPremisesInstances API action
100


Maximum number of instances that can be used by concurrent deployments that are in progress and associated with one account
500
