Troubleshoot deployment group issues
Tagging an instance as part of a deployment group does not automatically deploy your application to the new instance
CodeDeploy does not automatically deploy your application to a newly tagged instance. You must create a new deployment in the deployment group.
You can use CodeDeploy to enable automatic deployments to new Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups. For more information, see Integrating CodeDeploy with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.
