Get information about multiple on-premises instances
You can get information about on-premises instances by following the instructions in View CodeDeploydeployment details . You can use the AWS CLI or the CodeDeploy console to get more information about on-premises instances.
To get information about multiple on-premises instances (CLI)

For a list of on-premises instance names, call the list-on-premises-instances command, specifying:
    Whether to get information about all registered or deregistered on-premises instances (with the --registration-status option and Registered or Deregistered, respectively). If you omit this, then both registered and deregistered on-premises instance names are returned.
    Whether to get information only about on-premises instances tagged with specific on-premises instance tags (with the --tag-filters option). For each on-premises instance tag, specify the Key, Value, and Type (which should always be KEY_AND_VALUE). Separate multiple on-premises instance tags with spaces between each Key, Value, and Type triplet.

For example:
aws deploy list-on-premises-instances --registration-status Registered --tag-filters Key=Name,Value=CodeDeployDemo-OnPrem,Type=KEY_AND_VALUE Key=Name,Value=CodeDeployDemo-OnPrem-Beta,Type=KEY_AND_VALUE

For more detailed information, call the batch-get-on-premises-instances command, with the names of the on-premises instances (with the --instance-names option): 

aws deploy batch-get-on-premises-instances --instance-names AssetTag12010298EX AssetTag09920444EX
