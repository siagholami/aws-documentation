Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial, you must complete the prerequisites in Getting started with CodeDeploy, which include configuring your IAM user, installing or upgrading the AWS CLI, and creating a service role. You do not have to create an IAM instance profile as described in the prerequisites. On-premises instances do not use IAM instance profiles.
The physical device you will configure as an on-premises instance must be running one of the operating systems listed in Operating systems supported by the CodeDeploy agent.
