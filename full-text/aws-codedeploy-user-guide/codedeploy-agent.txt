Working with the CodeDeploy agent
The CodeDeploy agent is a software package that, when installed and configured on an instance, makes it possible for that instance to be used in CodeDeploy deployments. You must use version 1.0.1.1458 or later. If you use an earlier version, deployments to your instances might fail.
Note
 The CodeDeploy agent is required only if you deploy to an EC2/On-Premises compute platform. The agent is not required for deployments that use the Amazon ECS or AWS Lambda compute platform. 
A configuration file is placed on the instance when the agent is installed. This file is used to specify how the agent works. This configuration file specifies directory paths and other settings for AWS CodeDeploy to use as it interacts with the instance. You can change some of the configuration options in the file. For information about working with the CodeDeploy agent configuration file, see CodeDeploy agent configuration reference.
For more information about working with the CodeDeploy agent, such as steps for installing, updating, and verifying versions, see Managing CodeDeploy agent operations.

Application revision and log file cleanup
The CodeDeploy agent archives revisions and log files on instances. The CodeDeploy agent cleans up these artifacts to conserve disk space.
Application revision deployment logs: You can use the :max_revisions: option in the agent configuration file to specify the number of application revisions to archive by entering any positive integer. CodeDeploy also archives the log files for those revisions. All others are deleted, with the exception of the log file of the last successful deployment. That log file is always retained, even if the number of failed deployments exceeds the number of retained revisions. If no value is specified, CodeDeploy retains the five most recent revisions in addition to the currently deployed revision. 
CodeDeploy logs: For Amazon Linux, Ubuntu Server, and RHEL instances, the CodeDeploy agent rotates the log files under the /var/log/aws/codedeploy-agent folder. The log file is rotated at 00:00:00 (instance time) daily. Log files are deleted after seven days. The naming pattern for rotated log files is codedeploy-agent.YYYYMMDD.log.
Files installed by the CodeDeploy agent
The CodeDeploy agent stores revisions, deployment history, and deployment scripts in its root directory on an instance. The default name and location of this directory is:
'/opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root' for Amazon Linux, Ubuntu Server, and RHEL instances.
'C:\ProgramData\Amazon\CodeDeploy' for Windows Server instances. 
You can use the root_dir setting in the CodeDeploy agent configuration file to configure the directory's name and location. For more information, see CodeDeploy agent configuration reference.
The following is an example of the file and directory structure under the root directory. The structure assumes there are N number of deployment groups, and each deployment group contains N number of deployments. 
|--deployment-root/
|-- deployment group 1 ID 
|    |-- deployment 1 ID 
|    |    |-- Contents and logs of the deployment's revision

  Deployment Group ID folders represent each of your deployment groups. A deployment group directory's name is its ID (for example, acde1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef). Each deployment group directory contains one subdirectory for each attempted deployment in that deployment group. 
You can use the batch-get-deployments command to find a deployment group ID.
  Deployment ID folders represent each deployment in a deployment group. Each deployment directory's name is its ID. Each folder contains:
    bundle.tar, a compressed file with the contents of the deployment's revision. Use a zip decompression utility if you want to view the revision.
    deployment-archive, a directory that contains the contents of the deployment's revision. 
    logs, a directory that contains a scripts.log file. This file lists the output of all scripts specified in the deployment's AppSpec file. 
If you want to find the folder for a deployment but don't know its deployment ID or deployment group ID, you can use the AWS CodeDeploy console or the AWS CLI to find them. For more information, see View CodeDeploydeployment details . 
The default maximum number of deployments that can be archived in a deployment group is five. When that number is reached, future deployments are archived and the oldest archive is deleted. You can use the max_revisions setting in the CodeDeploy agent configuration file to change the default. For more information, see CodeDeploy agent configuration reference. 
Note
 If you want to recover hard disk space used by archived deployments, update the max_revisions setting to a low number, such as 1 or 2. The next deployment deletes archived deployments so that the number is equal to the you specified. 
  deployment-instructions contains four text files for each deployment group: 
   [Deployment Group ID]-cleanup, a text file with an undo verison of each command that is run during a deployment. An example file name is acde1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef-cleanup. 
   [Deployment Group ID]-install.json, a JSON file created during the most recent deployment. It contains the commands run during the deployment. An example file name is acde1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef-install.json.
   [Deployment Group ID]_last_successfull_install, a text file that lists the archive directory of the last successful deployment. This file is created when the CodeDeploy agent has copied all files in the deployment application to the instance. It is used by the CodeDeploy agent during the next deployment to determine which ApplicationStop and BeforeInstall scripts to run. An example file name is acde1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef_last_successfull_install.
   [Deployment Group ID]_most_recent_install, a text file that lists the name of the archive directory of the most recent deployment. This file is created when the files in the deployment are successfully downloaded. The [deployment group ID]_last_successfull_install file is created after this file, when the downloaded files are copied to their final destination. An example file name is acde1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef_most_recent_install.
  deployment-logs contains the following log files: 
    codedeploy-agent.yyyymmdd.log files are created for each day there is a deployment. Each log file contains information about the day's deployments. These log files might be useful for debugging problems like a permissions issue. The log file is initially named codedeploy-agent.log. The next day, the date of its deployments is inserted into the file name. For example, if today is January 3, 2018, you can see information about all of today's deployments in codedeploy-agent.log. Tomorrow, on January 4, 2018, the log file is renamed codedeploy-agent.20180103.log. 
    codedeploy-agent-deployments.log compiles the contents of scripts.log files for each deployment. The scripts.log files are located in the logs subfolder under each Deployment ID folder. The entries in this file are preceded by a deployment ID. For example, "[d-ABCDEF123]LifecycleEvent - BeforeInstall" might be written during a deployment with an ID of d-ABCDEF123. When codedeploy-agent-deployments.log reaches its maximum size, the CodeDeploy agent continues to write to it while deleting old content.
