To view application revision details:


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy.
Note
Sign in with the same account or IAM user information that you used in Getting started with CodeDeploy.


In the navigation pane, expand Deploy and choose Applications.
Note
If no entries are displayed, make sure the correct region is selected. On the navigation bar, in the region selector, choose one of the regions listed in Region and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference. CodeDeploy is supported in these regions only.


Choose the name of the application that has the revision you want to view.


On the Application details page, choose the Revisions tab, and review the list of revisions that are registered for the application. Choose a revision, then choose View details.


View application revision details (CLI)
To use the AWS CLI to view an application revision, call either the get-application-revision command or the list-application-revisions command.
Note
 References to GitHub apply to deployments to EC2/On-Premises deployments only. Revisions for AWS Lambda deployments do not work with GitHub. 
To view details about a single application revision, call the get-application-revision command, specifying: 
 The application name. To get the application name, call the list-applications command.
 For a revision stored in GitHub, the GitHub repository name and the ID of the commit that references the application revision that was pushed to the repository.
 For a revision stored in Amazon S3, the Amazon S3 bucket name containing the revision; the name and file type of the uploaded archive file; and, optionally, the archive file's Amazon S3 version identifier and ETag. If the version identifier, ETag, or both were specified during a call to register-application-revision, they must be specified here.
To view details about multiple application revisions, call the list-application-revisions command, specifying:
 The application name. To get the application name, call the list-applications command.
 Optionally, to view details for Amazon S3 application revisions only, the Amazon S3 bucket name containing the revisions.
 Optionally, to view details for Amazon S3 application revisions only, a prefix string to limit the search to Amazon S3 application revisions. (If not specified, CodeDeploy will list all matching Amazon S3 application revisions.)
 Optionally, whether to list revision details based on whether each revision is the target revision of a deployment group. (If not specified, CodeDeploy will list all matching revisions.)
 Optionally, the column name and order by which to sort the list of revision details. (If not specified, CodeDeploy will list results in an arbitrary order.)
You can list all revisions or only those revisions stored in Amazon S3. You cannot list only those revisions stored in GitHub.
