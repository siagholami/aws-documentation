Prerequisites
To follow along in this tutorial:
 Complete all of the steps in Getting started with CodeDeploy, including setting up and configuring the AWS CLI and creating an IAM instance profile (CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Instance-Profile) and a service role (CodeDeployDemo). A service role is a special type of IAM role that gives a service permission to act on your behalf.
 If you create your Auto Scaling group with a launch template, you must add the following permissions:
    ec2:RunInstances 
    ec2:CreateTags 
    iam:PassRole 
For more information, see Step 3: Create a service role and Creating a launch template for an Auto Scaling group.

   Create and use the sample revision in Step 2: Create a sample application revision in the Tutorial: Deploy an application to an on-premises instance with CodeDeploy (Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux) tutorial. 
   Create a revision on your own, see Working with application revisions for CodeDeploy.
