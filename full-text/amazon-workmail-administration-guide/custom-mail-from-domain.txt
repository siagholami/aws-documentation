Configuring a custom MAIL FROM domain in Amazon WorkMail
By default, Amazon WorkMail uses a subdomain of amazonses.com as the MAIL FROM domain for your outgoing email. This can cause delivery failure if the DMARC policy on your domain is only set up for SPF. To resolve this, configure your own domain as the MAIL FROM domain. To learn how to set up your email domain as the MAIL FROM domain, see Setting up a custom MAIL FROM domain in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.
