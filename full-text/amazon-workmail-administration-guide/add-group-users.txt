Add users to a group
After you create and enable an Amazon WorkMail group, use the Amazon WorkMail console to add users to that group.
Note
If Amazon WorkMail is integrated with a connected Active Directory service or Microsoft Active Directory, you can manage your group members using Active Directory. This can take a longer time to propagate to Amazon WorkMail.
You can add up to 100 users at a time by using the following procedure.
To add users to a group


Open the Amazon WorkMail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/.


If you require a different AWS Region, change it from the navigation bar. For more information, see Regions and endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.


For Organizations, choose the name of your organization.


Choose Groups.


Select the name of the group.


On the Group details page, choose Members.


Choose Edit.


Under Users and groups, search for the users to add to the group, and select them.


Choose >>. The users appear under Group members.


Choose Save.


Your changes might take a few minutes to propagate.
