Working with groups
Groups can be used as distribution lists in Amazon WorkMail for receiving emails for generic email addresses like sales@example.com or support@example.com. You can create multiple email aliases for a group.
You can also use groups as security groups to share a mailbox or calendar with a certain team. It can take up to 2 hours before newly added groups appear in your Microsoft Outlook offline address book.
Groups do not have their own mailboxes. For information about setting up group permissions, see Managing group permissions.
