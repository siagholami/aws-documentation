You can work with any AWS migration partners to migrate to Amazon WorkMail. For information about these providers, see Amazon WorkMail features.
To migrate your mailboxes, create a dedicated Amazon WorkMail user to act as migration administrator. The following procedure grants permission to that user to access all the mailboxes in your organization.
To create a migration administrator


Do one of the following:
    In the Amazon WorkMail console, create a new user to act as migration administrator. For more information, see Creating users.
    In your Active Directory, create a new user to act as migration administrator, and enable the user for Amazon WorkMail. For more information, see Enabling existing users.


In the Amazon WorkMail console, for Organizations, choose the name of your organization.


Choose Organization settings, Migration, Edit.


For Mailbox permissions, select On.


Choose Select user.


Search for and select the user to act as migration administrator, and choose Select user.


Choose Save.


Step 3: Complete the migration to Amazon WorkMail
After you have migrated your email accounts to Amazon WorkMail, verify your DNS records and configure your desktop and mobile clients.
To complete migration to Amazon WorkMail


Verify that all DNS records are updated and that they point to Amazon WorkMail. For more information about the required DNS records, see Adding a domain. 
Note
The DNS record update process may take several hours. If any new items appear in a source mailbox while the MX records are being changed, run the migration tool again to migrate new items after the DNS records are updated.
