Amazon WorkMail identity-based policy examples
By default, IAM users and roles don't have permission to create or modify Amazon WorkMail resources. They also can't perform tasks using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS API. An IAM administrator must create IAM policies that grant users and roles permission to perform specific API operations on the specified resources they need. The administrator must then attach those policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions.
To learn how to create an IAM identity-based policy using these example JSON policy documents, see Creating policies on the JSON tab in the IAM User Guide.

Policy best practices
Identity-based policies are very powerful. They determine whether someone can create, access, or delete resources in your account. These actions can incur costs for your AWS account. When you create or edit identity-based policies, follow these guidelines and recommendations:
 Get Started Using AWS Managed Policies – To start using quickly, use AWS managed policies to give your employees the permissions they need. These policies are already available in your account and are maintained and updated by AWS. For more information, see Get Started Using Permissions With AWS Managed Policies in the IAM User Guide.
 Grant Least Privilege – When you create custom policies, grant only the permissions required to perform a task. Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary. Doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later. For more information, see Grant Least Privilege in the IAM User Guide.
 Enable MFA for Sensitive Operations – For extra security, require IAM users to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access sensitive resources or API operations. For more information, see Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in AWS in the IAM User Guide.
 Use Policy Conditions for Extra Security – To the extent that it's practical, define the conditions under which your identity-based policies allow access to a resource. For example, you can write conditions to specify a range of allowable IP addresses that a request must come from. You can also write conditions to allow requests only within a specified date or time range, or to require the use of SSL or MFA. For more information, see IAM JSON Policy Elements: Condition in the IAM User Guide.
Using the Amazon WorkMail console
To access the Amazon WorkMail console, you must have a minimum set of permissions. These permissions must allow you to list and view details about the Amazon WorkMail resources in your AWS account. If you create an identity-based policy that is more restrictive than the minimum required permissions, the console won't function as intended for entities (IAM users or roles) with that policy.
To ensure that those entities can still use the Amazon WorkMail console, also attach the following AWS managed policy, AmazonWorkMailFullAccess, to the entities. For more information, see Adding permissions to a user in the IAM User Guide.
The AmazonWorkMailFullAccess policy grants an IAM user full access to Amazon WorkMail resources. This policy gives the user access to all Amazon WorkMail, AWS Key Management Service, Amazon Simple Email Service, and AWS Directory Service operations. This also includes several Amazon EC2 operations that Amazon WorkMail needs to perform on your behalf. The logs and cloudwatch permissions are required for email event logging and viewing metrics in the Amazon WorkMail console. For more information, see Logging and monitoring in Amazon WorkMail.

    ]
}
You don't need to allow minimum console permissions for users that are making calls only to the AWS CLI or the AWS API. Instead, allow access to only the actions that match the API operation that you're trying to perform.
Allow users to view their own permissions
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows IAM users to view the inline and managed policies that are attached to their user identity. This policy includes permissions to complete this action on the console or programmatically using the AWS CLI or AWS API.

            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Allow users read-only access to Amazon WorkMail resources
The following policy statement grants an IAM user read-only access to Amazon WorkMail resources. This policy gives the same level of access as the AWS managed policy AmazonWorkMailReadOnlyAccess. Either policy gives the user access to all of the Amazon WorkMail Describe operations. Access to the AWS Directory Service DescribeDirectories operation is needed to obtain information about your AWS Directory Service directories. Access to the Amazon SES service is needed to obtain information about the configured domains. Access to AWS Key Management Service is needed to obtain information about the used encryption keys. The logs and cloudwatch permissions are required for email event logging and viewing metrics in the Amazon WorkMail console. For more information, see Logging and monitoring in Amazon WorkMail.
