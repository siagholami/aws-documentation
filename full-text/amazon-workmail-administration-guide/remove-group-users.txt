Remove users from a group
Use the Amazon WorkMail console to remove users from a group.
Note
If Amazon WorkMail is integrated with a connected Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory, you can manage your group members using the Active Directory. This can take a longer time to propagate to Amazon WorkMail.
To remove users from a group


Open the Amazon WorkMail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/.


If you require a different AWS Region, change it from the navigation bar. For more information, see Regions and endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.


For Organizations, choose the name of your organization.


Choose Groups.


Select the name of the group.


On the Group details page, choose Members.


Choose Edit.


Under Group members, search for the users to add to the group, and select them.


Choose <<. The users no longer appear under Group members.


Choose Save.


Your changes might take a few minutes to propagate.
