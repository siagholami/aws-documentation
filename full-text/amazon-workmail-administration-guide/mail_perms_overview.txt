Working with mailbox permissions
You can use mailbox permissions in Amazon WorkMail to grant users or groups the right to work in other users' mailboxes. Mailbox permissions apply to an entire mailbox, enabling multiple users to access the same mailbox without sharing the credentials for that mailbox. Users with mailbox permissions can read and modify mailbox data and send email from the shared mailbox.
The following list shows the permissions that you can grant:
 Send On Behalf: Enables a user or group to send email on behalf of another user. The mailbox owner appears in the From: header, and the sender appears in the Sender: header. 
 Send As: Enables a user or group to send email as the mailbox owner, without showing the actual sender of the message. The mailbox owner appears in both the From: and Sender: headers.
 Full Access: Enables full read and write access to the mailbox, including permissions to modify folder-level permissions.
Note
Granting mailbox permissions to a group extends those permissions to all the members of that group, including members of nested groups.
When you grant mailbox permissions, the Amazon WorkMail AutoDiscover service automatically updates access to those mailboxes for the users or groups you added. 
For the Microsoft Outlook client in Windows, users with full access permissions can automatically access the shared mailboxes. Allow up to 60 minutes for the changes to propagate, or restart Microsoft Outlook. 
For the Amazon WorkMail web application and other email clients, users with full access permissions can manually open the shared mailboxes. Opened mailboxes stay open, even between sessions, unless the user closes them.

Mailbox and folder permissions
Mailbox permissions apply to all folders in a mailbox. These permissions can only be enabled by the AWS account holder or the IAM user authorized to call the Amazon WorkMail management API. To apply the permissions to mailboxes or groups as a whole, log in to the AWS Management Console or use the Amazon WorkMail API. You can manage up to 100 mailbox and group permissions from the console. To manage more permissions, use the Amazon WorkMail API.
Folder permissions apply only to a single folder. These permissions can be set by end users, either by using an email client or by using the Amazon WorkMail web application.
