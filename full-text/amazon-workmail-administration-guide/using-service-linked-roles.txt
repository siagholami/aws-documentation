Using service-linked roles for Amazon WorkMail
Amazon WorkMail uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Amazon WorkMail. Service-linked roles are predefined by Amazon WorkMail and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. 
A service-linked role makes setting up Amazon WorkMail easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions. Amazon WorkMail defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only Amazon WorkMail can assume its roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.
You can delete a service-linked role only after first deleting the related resources. This protects your Amazon WorkMail resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission to access the resources.
For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS services that work with IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-linked role column. Choose a Yes with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.
Service-linked role permissions for Amazon WorkMail
Amazon WorkMail uses the service-linked role named AmazonWorkMailEvents – Amazon WorkMail uses this service-linked role to enable access to AWS services and resources used or managed by Amazon WorkMail events, such as monitoring email events logged by CloudWatch. For more information about enabling email event logging for Amazon WorkMail, see Tracking messages.
The AmazonWorkMailEvents service-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:
 events.workmail.amazonaws.com
The role permissions policy allows Amazon WorkMail to complete the following actions on the specified resources:
 Action: logs:CreateLogGroup on all AWS resources
 Action: logs:CreateLogStream on all AWS resources
 Action: logs:PutLogEvents on all AWS resources
You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-linked role permissions in the IAM User Guide.
Creating a service-linked role for Amazon WorkMail
You don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you turn on Amazon WorkMail event logging and use the default settings in the Amazon WorkMail console, Amazon WorkMail creates the service-linked role for you. 
If you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account. When you turn on Amazon WorkMail event logging and use the default settings, Amazon WorkMail creates the service-linked role for you again. 
Editing a service-linked role for Amazon WorkMail
Amazon WorkMail does not allow you to edit the AmazonWorkMailEvents service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
Deleting a service-linked role for Amazon WorkMail
If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role. That way you don’t have an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained. However, you must clean up the resources for your service-linked role before you can manually delete it.
Note
If the Amazon WorkMail service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.
