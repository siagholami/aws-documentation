server
Normally, when you issue a command in cloudhsm_mgmt_util, the command effects all HSMs in the designated cluster (global mode). However, there may be circumstances for which you need to issue commands to a single HSM. For instance, in the event that automatic synchronization fails, you may need to sync keys and users on an HSM in order to maintain consistency across the cluster. You can use the server command in the cloudhsm_mgmt_util to enter server mode and interact directly with a particular HSM instance.
Upon successful initiation, the aws-cloudhsm> command prompt is replaced with the server> command prompt.
In order to exit server mode, use the exit command. Upon successful exit, you will be returned to the cloudhsm_mgmt_util command prompt.
Before you run any cloudhsm_mgmt_util command, you must start cloudhsm_mgmt_util.
User Type
The following users can run this command.
 All users.
Prerequisites
In order to enter server mode, you must first know the server number of the target HSM. Server numbers are listed in the trace output generated by cloudhsm_mgmt_util upon initiation. Server numbers are assigned in the same order that the HSMs appear in the configuration file. For this example, we assume that server 0 is the server that corresponds to the desired HSM.
Syntax
To start server mode:
server <server-number>
To exit server mode:
server> exit
Example
This command enters server mode on an HSM with server number 0.
```
aws-cloudhsm> server 0
Server is in 'E2' mode...
```
In order to exit server mode, use the exit command.
server0> exit
Arguments
server <server-number>
