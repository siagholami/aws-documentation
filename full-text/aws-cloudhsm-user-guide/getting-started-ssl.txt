Reconfigure SSL with a New Certificate and Private Key (Optional)
AWS CloudHSM uses an SSL certificate to establish a connection to an HSM. A default key and SSL certificate are included when you install the client. You can, however, create and use your own. Note that you will need the selfâ€“signed certificate (customerCA.crt) that you created when you initialized your cluster. 
To reconfigure SSL with a new certificate and private key

Create a private key using the following OpenSSL command:

openssl genrsa -out ssl-client.key 2048
   Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
   ........
   ............
   e is 65537 (0x10001)

Use the following OpenSSL command to create a certificate signing request (CSR). You will be asked a series of questions for your certificate. 

```
   openssl req -new -sha256 -key ssl-client.key -out ssl-client.csr
   Enter pass phrase for ssl-client.key:
   You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
   into your certificate request.
   What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
   There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
   For some fields there will be a default value,
   If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:
   State or Province Name (full name) []:
   Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:
   Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:
   Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
   Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:
   Email Address []:
Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
   to be sent with your certificate request
   A challenge password []:
   An optional company name []:
   ```

Sign the CSR with the customerCA.crt certificate that you created when you initialized your cluster. 

openssl x509 -req -days 3652 -in ssl-client.csr \
           -CA customerCA.crt \
           -CAkey customerCA.key \
           -CAcreateserial \
           -out ssl-client.crt
   Signature ok
   subject=/C=US/ST=WA/L=Seattle/O=Example Company/OU=sales
   Getting CA Private Key

Copy your key and certificate to the appropriate directory. In Linux, use the following commands. The configure --ssl option became available with version 1.0.14 of the AWS CloudHSM client. 

sudo cp ssl-client.crt /opt/cloudhsm/etc/
   sudo cp ssl-client.key /opt/cloudhsm/etc/
   sudo /opt/cloudhsm/bin/configure --ssl --pkey /opt/cloudhsm/etc/ssl-client.key --cert /opt/cloudhsm/etc/ssl-client.crt

Add the customerCA.crt certificate to the trust store. Create a hash of the certificate subject name. This creates an index to allow the certificate to be looked up by that name. Create a file that contains the certificate with the hash name. 

openssl x509 -in /opt/cloudhsm/etc/customerCA.crt -hash | head -n 1
   1234abcd
   sudo cp /opt/cloudhsm/etc/customerCA.crt /opt/cloudhsm/etc/certs/1234abcd.0
