syncUser
You can use the syncUser command in cloudhsm_mgmt_util to manually synchronize crypto users (CUs) or crypto officers (COs) across HSM instances within a cluster or across cloned clusters. AWS CloudHSM does not automatically synchronize users. Generally, you manage users in global mode so that all HSMs in a cluster are updated together. You might need to use syncUser if an HSM is accidentally desynchronized (for example, due to password changes) or if you want to rotate user credentials across cloned clusters. Cloned clusters are usually created in different AWS Regions to simplify the global scaling and disaster recovery processes.
Before you run any cloudhsm_mgmt_util command, you must start cloudhsm_mgmt_util and log in to the HSM. Be sure that you log in with the user account type that can run the commands you plan to use.
If you add or delete HSMs, update the configuration files that the AWS CloudHSM client and the command line tools use. Otherwise, the changes that you make might not be effective for all HSMs in the cluster.
User Type
The following types of users can run this command.
 Crypto officers (CO)
Prerequisites
Before you begin, you must know the user ID of the user on the source HSM to be synchronized with the destination HSM. To find the user ID, use the listUsers command to list all users on the HSMs in a cluster.
You also need to know the server ID assigned to the source and destination HSMs, which are shown in the trace output returned by cloudhsm_mgmt_util upon initiation. These are assigned in the same order that the HSMs appear in the configuration file.
If you are synchronizing HSMs across cloned clusters, follow the instructions in Using cloudhsm_mgmt_util Across Cloned Clusters and initialize cloudhsm_mgmt_util with the new config file.
When you are ready to run syncUser, enter server mode on the source HSM by issuing the server command.
Syntax
Because this command does not have named parameters, you must enter the arguments in the order specified in the syntax diagram.
syncUser <user ID> <server ID>
Example
Run the server command to log into the source HSM and enter server mode. For this example, we assume that server 0 is the source HSM.
aws-cloudhsm> server 0
Now run the syncUser command. For this example, we assume that user 6 is the user to be synced, and server 1 is the destination HSM.
server 0> syncUser 6 1
ExtractMaskedObject: 0x0 !
InsertMaskedObject: 0x0 !
syncUser success
Arguments
Because this command does not have named parameters, you must enter the arguments in the order specified in the syntax diagram.
syncUser <user ID> <server ID>

Specifies the ID of the user to sync. You can specify only one user in each command. To get the ID of a user, use listUsers.
Required: Yes

Specifies the server number of the HSM to which you are syncing a user.
Required: Yes
