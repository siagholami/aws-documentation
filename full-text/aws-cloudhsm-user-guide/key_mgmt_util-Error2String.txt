Error2String
The Error2String helper command in key_mgmt_util returns the error that corresponds to a key_mgmt_util hexadecimal error code. You can use this command when troubleshooting your commands and scripts.
Before you run any key_mgmt_util command, you must start key_mgmt_util and log in to the HSM as a crypto user (CU). 
Syntax
```
Error2String -h
Error2String -r 
```
Examples
These examples show how to use Error2String to get the error string for a key_mgmt_util error code. 
Example : Get an Error Description
This command gets the error description for the 0xdb error code. The description explains that an attempt to log in to key_mgmt_util failed because the user has the wrong user type. Only crypto users (CU) can log in to key_mgmt_util.  
```
        Command:  Error2String -r 0xdb
    Error Code db maps to HSM Error: Invalid User Type.

```
Example : Find the Error Code
This example shows where to find the error code in a key_mgmt_util error. The error code, 0xc6, appears after the string: Cfm3command-name returned:.
In this example, getKeyInfo indicates that the current user (user 4) can use the key in cryptographic operations. Nevertheless, when the user tries to use deleteKey to delete the key, the command returns error code 0xc6.   
```
        Command:  deleteKey -k 262162
    Cfm3DeleteKey returned: 0xc6 : HSM Error: Key Access is denied

    Cluster Error Status

    Command:  getKeyInfo -k 262162

    Cfm3GetKey returned: 0x00 : HSM Return: SUCCESS

   Owned by user 3

   also, shared to following 1 user(s):

            4

``
If the0xc6error is reported to you, you can use an Error2String command like this one to look up the error\. In this case, thedeleteKey` command failed with an access denied error because the key is shared with the current user but owned by a different user. Only key owners have permission to delete a key.  
```
        Command:  Error2String -r 0xa8
    Error Code c6 maps to HSM Error: Key Access is denied

```
