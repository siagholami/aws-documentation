IsValidKeyHandlefile
The IsValidKeyHandlefile command in key_mgmt_util is used to find out whether a key file in an HSM contains a real private key or a fake PEM key. A fake PEM file does not contain the actual private key material but instead references the private key in the HSM. Such a file can be used to establish SSL/TLS offloading from your web server to AWS CloudHSM. For more information, see SSL/TLS Offload on Linux.
Before you run any key_mgmt_util command, you must start key_mgmt_util and log in to the HSM as a crypto user (CU).
Syntax
```
IsValidKeyHandlefile -h
IsValidKeyHandlefile -k <private-key-handle
                     -f 
```
