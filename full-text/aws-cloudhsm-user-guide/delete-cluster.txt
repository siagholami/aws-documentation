Deleting an AWS CloudHSM Cluster
Before you can delete a cluster, you must remove all HSMs from the cluster. For more information, see Removing an HSM.
After you remove all HSMs, you can delete a cluster by using the AWS CloudHSM console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the AWS CloudHSM API.
To delete a cluster (console)


Open the AWS CloudHSM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/.


Choose the cluster that you are deleting. Then choose Delete cluster.


Confirm that you want to delete the cluster, then choose Delete.


To delete a cluster (AWS CLI)
 At a command prompt, issue the delete-cluster command, passing the ID of the cluster that you are deleting. If you don't know the cluster ID, issue the describe-clusters command.
$ aws cloudhsmv2 delete-cluster --cluster-id <cluster ID>
