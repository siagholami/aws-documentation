Regions
For information about the supported Regions for AWS CloudHSM, see AWS CloudHSM Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference, or the Region Table.
Like most AWS resources, clusters and HSMs are regional resources. To create HSMs in multiple Regions, you must first create a cluster in each Region. You cannot reuse or extend a cluster across Regions. You must perform all the required steps listed in Getting Started with AWS CloudHSM to create a cluster in a new Region.
AWS CloudHSM might not be available in all Availability Zones in a given Region. However, this should not affect performance, as AWS CloudHSM automatically load balances across all HSMs in a cluster.
