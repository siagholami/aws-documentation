findKey
Use the findKey command in key_mgmt_util to search for keys by the values of the key attributes. When a key matches all the criteria that you set, findKey returns the key handle. With no parameters, findKey returns the key handles of all the keys that you can use in the HSM. To find the attribute values of a particular key, use getAttribute.
Like all key_mgmt_util commands, findKey is user specific. It returns only the keys that the current user can use in cryptographic operations. This includes keys that current user owns and keys that have been shared with the current user. 
Before you run any key_mgmt_util command, you must start key_mgmt_util and log in to the HSM as a crypto user (CU). 
Syntax
```
findKey -h 
findKey [-c ] 
        [-t ]
        [-l ] 
        [-id ]
        [-sess (0 | 1)] 
        [-u ]
        [-m ]
        [-kcv ]
```
Examples
These examples show how to use findKey to find and identify keys in your HSMs.
Example : Find All Keys
This command finds all keys for the current user in the HSM. The output includes keys that the user owns and shares, and all public keys in the HSMs.
To get the attributes of a key with a particular key handle, use getAttribute. To determine whether the current user owns or shares a particular key, use getKeyInfo or findAllKeys in cloudhsm_mgmt_util.  
```
Command: findKey
Total number of keys present 13
number of keys matched from start index 0::12
6, 7, 524296, 9, 262154, 262155, 262156, 262157, 262158, 262159, 262160, 262161, 262162
    Cluster Error Status
    Node id 1 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
    Node id 0 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS

    Cfm3FindKey returned: 0x00 : HSM Return: SUCCESS

```
Example : Find Keys by Type, User, and Session
This command finds persistent AES keys that the current user and user 3 can use. (User 3 might be able to use other keys that the current user cannot see.)  
Command: findKey -t 31 -sess 0 -u 3
Example : Find Keys by Class and Label
This command finds all public keys for the current user with the 2018-sept label.  
Command: findKey -c 2 -l 2018-sept
Example : Find RSA Keys by Modulus
This command finds RSA keys (type 0) for the current user that were created by using the modulus in the m4.txt file.  
Command: findKey -t 0 -m m4.txt
Parameters
-h
Displays help for the command. 
Required: Yes
-t
Finds keys of the specified type. Enter the constant that represents the key class. For example, to find 3DES keys, type -t 21.
Valid values: 
 0: RSA
 1: DSA
 3: EC
 16: GENERIC_SECRET
 18: RC4
 21: Triple DES (3DES)
 31: AES
Required: No
-c
Finds keys in the specified class. Enter the constant that represents the key class. For example, to find public keys, type -c 2.
Valid values for each key type:
 2: Public. This class contains the public keys of public–private key pairs.
 3: Private. This class contains the private keys of public–private key pairs.
 4: Secret. This class contains all symmetric keys.
Required: No
-l
Finds keys with the specified label. Type the exact label. You cannot use wildcard characters or regular expressions in the --l value.
Required: No
-id
Finds the key with the specified ID. Type the exact ID string. You cannot use wildcard characters or regular expressions in the -id value.
Required: No
-sess
Finds keys by session status. To find keys that are valid only in the current session, type 1. To find persistent keys, type 0.
Required: No
-u
Finds keys the specified users and the current user share. Type a comma-separated list of HSM user IDs, such as -u 3 or -u 4,7. To find the IDs of users on an HSM, use listUsers.
When you specify one user ID, findKey returns the keys for that user. When you specify multiple user IDs, findKey returns the keys that all the specified users can use.
Because findKey only returns keys that the current user can use, the -u results are always identical to or a subset of the current user's keys. To get all keys that are owned by or shared with any user, crypto officers (COs) can use findAllKeys in cloudhsm_mgmt_util.
Required: No
-m
Finds keys that were created by using the RSA modulus in the specified file. Type the path to file that stores the modulus.
Required: No
-kcv
Finds keys with the specified key check value.
The key check value (KCV) is a 3-byte hash or checksum of a key that is generated when the HSM imports or generates a key. You can also calculate a KCV outside of the HSM, such as after you export a key. You can then compare the KCV values to confirm the identity and integrity of the key. To get the KCV of a key, use getAttribute.
AWS CloudHSM uses the following standard method to generate a key check value:
 Symmetric keys: First 3 bytes of the result of encrypting a zero-block with the key.
 Asymmetric key pairs: First 3 bytes of the SHA-1 hash of the public key.
 HMAC keys: KVC for HMAC keys is not supported at this time.
Required: No
Output
The findKey output lists the total number of matching keys and their key handles.
