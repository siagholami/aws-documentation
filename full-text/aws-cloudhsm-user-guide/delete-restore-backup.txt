Deleting and Restoring an AWS CloudHSM Cluster Backup
AWS CloudHSM Cluster Backups are packages of encrypted data that contain the elements of a particular cluster. Backups are generated once a day, as well as whenever an HSM is added to a cluster.
You may want to remove certain cryptographic materials from your AWS environment, such as an expired key or inactive user. In order to remove these materials, you first delete them from your HSMs. To ensure that deleted information is not restored when initializing a new cluster with an old backup, you must then delete all existing backups of the cluster. To do this, you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the  AWS CloudHSM API.
A backup must be in the READY state in order to be deleted. You can check the status of a backup by using the describe-backups command from the AWS CLI, or with the DescribeBackups API call.
Upon successful deletion, a backup is in the PENDING_DELETION state for 7 days, during which time it can be restored with the restore-backup command. After the deletion window has passed, the target backup can no longer be restored.
To delete and restore a backup (AWS CLI)

At a command prompt, run the delete-backup command, passing the ID of the backup to be deleted. If you don't know the backup ID, run the describe-backups command.

$ aws cloudhsmv2 delete-backup --backup-id <backup ID>
   {
       "Backup": {
           "CreateTimestamp": 1534461854.64,
           "ClusterId": "cluster-dygnwhmscg5",
           "BackupId": "backup-ro5c4er4aac",
           "BackupState": "PENDING_DELETION",
           "DeleteTimestamp": 1536339805.522
       }
   }

To restore a backup, issue the restore-backup command, passing the ID of a backup that is in the PENDING_DELETION state. You can check the status of a backup by issuing the describe-backups command with the ID of the target backup. If you would like to see a list of all backups in the PENDING_DELETION state, run the describe-backups command and include states=PENDING_DELETION as a filter.

$ aws cloudhsmv2 describe-backups --filters states=PENDING_DELETION
   {
       "Backups": [
           {
               "BackupId": "backup-ro5c4er4aac",
               "BackupState": "PENDING_DELETION",
               "CreateTimestamp": 1534461854.64,
               "ClusterId": "cluster-dygnwhmscg5",
               "DeleteTimestap": 1536339805.522,
           }
   }
$ aws cloudhsmv2 restore-backup --backup-id <backup ID>
   {
       "Backup": {
           "ClusterId": "cluster-dygnwhmscg5",
           "CreateTimestamp": 1534461854.64,
           "BackupState": "READY",
           "BackupId": "backup-ro5c4er4aac"
       }
   }
To delete and restore a backup (AWS CloudHSM API):


To delete a backup, send a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteBackup.html request, specifying the ID of the backup to be deleted.


To restore a backup, send a RestoreBackup request, specifying the ID of the backup to be restored.
