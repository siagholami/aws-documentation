Create an HSM
After you create a cluster, you can create an HSM. However, before you can create an HSM in your cluster, the cluster must be in the uninitialized state. To determine the cluster's state, view the clusters page in the AWS CloudHSM console, use the AWS CLI to run the describe-clusters command, or send a DescribeClusters request in the AWS CloudHSM API. You can create an HSM from the AWS CloudHSM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS CloudHSM API. 
To create an HSM (console)


Open the AWS CloudHSM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/.


Choose Initialize next to the cluster that you created previously.


Choose an Availability Zone (AZ) for the HSM that you are creating. Then choose Create.


To create an HSM (AWS CLI)
 At a command prompt, run the create-hsm command. Specify the cluster ID of the cluster that you created previously and an Availability Zone for the HSM. Specify the Availability Zone in the form of us-west-2a, us-west-2b, etc.
```
  $ aws cloudhsmv2 create-hsm --cluster-id  --availability-zone 
{
      "Hsm": {
          "HsmId": "hsm-ted36yp5b2x",
          "EniIp": "10.0.1.12",
          "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2a",
          "ClusterId": "cluster-igklspoyj5v",
          "EniId": "eni-5d7ade72",
          "SubnetId": "subnet-fd54af9b",
          "State": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS"
      }
  }
  ```
To create an HSM (AWS CloudHSM API)
 Send a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html request. Specify the cluster ID of the cluster that you created previously and an Availability Zone for the HSM. 
After you create a cluster and HSM, you can optionally verify the identity of the HSM, or proceed directly to Initialize the Cluster.
