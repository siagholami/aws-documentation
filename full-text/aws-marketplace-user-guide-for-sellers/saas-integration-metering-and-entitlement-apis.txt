Accessing the AWS Marketplace Metering and Entitlement Service APIs
This section outlines the process of integrating with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service or AWS Marketplace Entitlement Service, used to ensure your billing and reporting of customer usage of your SaaS products is accurate. It's assumed that you've submitted a SaaS subscriptions product or a SaaS contracts product that has been published to a limited state. In a limited state, you can use your test accounts to verify proper configuration and function but your product is not available publicly.
