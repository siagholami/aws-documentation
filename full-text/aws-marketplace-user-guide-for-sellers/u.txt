US sales and use tax report
This monthly report provides sellers with information about US sales and use tax that AWS collects from sales and use transactions in AWS Marketplace. The report includes both products that sellers enroll in the AWS Marketplace US sales tax collection service and products that AWS is required to collect and remit tax on.
For sales of products enrolled in the tax calculation service, the report includes calculated US sales and use tax for products with a product tax code. Any products without a product tax code appear in this report with a tax value of $0.00 USD. For sales of products that are not eligible for the tax calculation service because of enacted marketplace facilitator rules, you will see amounts that AWS has collected and remitted as AWS, based on our internal tax decisions. For more information, see AWS Marketplace Sellers & Tax Collection on Amazon Web Services Tax Help.
To map transactions between the disbursement report and this report, use the Transaction Reference ID.
This report is available on the AWS Marketplace Management Portal under the Reports tab. If you're enrolled in the AWS Marketplace commerce analytics service, you can use API calls to pull down sections of this report. For more information, see AWS Marketplace Commerce Analytics Service.
