Address data feed
This data feed provides contact information for all the accounts you interact with: your own, any channel partners you work with, buyers, payers, and all taxed accounts. Each time a new transaction occurs, the customer address for the transaction is scanned, and if it's not in your data feed, a new entry is added to your data feed file.
Address data is immutable. 
The address data feed is refreshed every 24 hours, so new data is available daily.
The following table explains the names and descriptions of the data feed's columns.
