Offer target data feed
This data feed lists targets of an offer's revision for all offers you've created as the seller of record. If a single offer has multiple revisions, all revisions are included in the data feed.
When you make an offer revision and the data in an exposed field changes, a new record is created in the data feed for the same primary key (offer_id plus offer_revision), but with a different value for valid_from field. 
The offer target data feed is refreshed every 24 hours, so new data is available daily.
The following table explains the names and descriptions of the data feed's columns.
