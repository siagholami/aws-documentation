Tax item data feed
This data feed provides information on tax calculations for a customer invoice.
There can be multiple line items (line_item_id) for a given product (product_id) of a given customer invoice (invoice_id), one or more for each tax jurisdiction. This happens, for example, with usage-based bills for customers who are using different AWS region rules by different AWS entities (say, the U.S. and Ireland). To learn more about where AWS collects sales tax, VAT, or GST on your sales and remits such taxes to the local tax authorities, in the name of AWS, Inc., see Amazon Web Service Tax Help.
The tax item data feed is refreshed every 24 hours, so new data is available daily.
Tax item data is immutable. 
The following table explains the names and descriptions of the data feed's columns. For information about data history columns, see Historization of the data.
