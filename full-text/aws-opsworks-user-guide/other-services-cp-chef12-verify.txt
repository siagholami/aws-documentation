Step 6: Verifying the app deployment in AWS OpsWorks Stacks
To verify that CodePipeline deployed the Node.js app to your stack, sign in to the instance you created in Step 1: Create a stack, layer, and an instance in AWS OpsWorks Stacks. You should be able to see and use the Node.js web app.
To verify the app deployment in your AWS OpsWorks Stacks instance


Open the AWS OpsWorks console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/.


On the AWS OpsWorks Stacks dashboard, choose CodePipelineDemo, and then choose Node.js App Server.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances, and then choose the public IP address of the instance that you created to view the web app.



The app will be displayed in a new browser tab.
