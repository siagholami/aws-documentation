Step 17: (Optional) Clean Up
To prevent incurring additional charges to your AWS account, you can delete the AWS resources that were used for this walkthrough. These AWS resources include the S3 bucket, the AWS OpsWorks Stacks stack, and the stack's components. (For more information, see AWS OpsWorks Pricing.) However, you might want to keep using these AWS resources as you continue to learn more about AWS OpsWorks Stacks. If you want to keep these AWS resources available, you have now completed this walkthrough, and you can skip to Next Steps.
