layers Attributes
The layers attribute contains a set of layer attributes, one for each of the stack's layers, which are named with the layer's short name, such as php-app. A stack can have at most one each of the built-in layers, whose short names are as follows:
 db-master: MySQL layer
 java-app: Java App Server layer
 lb: HAProxy layer
 monitoring-master: Ganglia layer
 memcached: Memcached layer
 nodejs-app: Node.js App Server layer
 php-app: PHP App Server layer
 rails-app: Rails App Server layer
 web: Static Web Server layer
A stack can contain any number of custom layers, which have user-defined short names.
Each layer attribute contains the following attributes:
 id
 instances
 name
id 
The layer ID, which is a GUID that is generated by OpsWorks and uniquely identifies the layer (string).  
node["opsworks"]["layers"]["layershortname"]["id"]
instances 
The instances element contains a set of instance attributes, one for each of the layer's online instances. They are named with the instance's host name, such as php-app1.
The instances element contains only those instances that are in the online state when the particular stack configuration and deployment attributes are created.
Each instance element contains the following attributes:    

[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
availability_zone 
The Availability Zone, such as "us-west-2a" (string).  
node["opsworks"]["layers"]["layershortname"]["instances"]["instancehostname"]["availability_zone"]
aws_instance_id 
The EC2 instance ID (string).  
node["opsworks"]["layers"]["layershortname"]["instances"]["instancehostname"]["aws_instance_id"]
backends 
The number of back-end web processes (number). It determines, for example, the number of concurrent connections that HAProxy will forward to a Rails back end. The default value depends on the instance's memory and number of cores.  
node["opsworks"]["layers"]["layershortname"]["instances"]["instancehostname"]["backends"]
booted_at 
The time that the EC2 instance was booted, using the UTC yyyy-mm-dddThh:mm:sshh:mm format (string). For example, "2013-10-01T08:35:2200:00" corresponds to 8:35:22 on Oct. 10, 2013, with no time zone offset. For more information, see ISO 8601.  
node["opsworks"]["layers"]["layershortname"]["instances"]["instancehostname"]["booted_at"]
created_at 
The time that the EC2 instance was created, using the UTC yyyy-mm-dddThh:mm:sshh:mm format (string). For example, "2013-10-01T08:35:2200:00" corresponds to 8:35:22 on Oct. 10, 2013, with no time zone offset. For more information, see ISO 8601.

instance_type 
The instance type, such as "c1.medium" (string).

ip

status

 "connection_lost"
node["opsworks"]["layers"]["layershortname"]["instances"]["instancehostname"]["status"]
name
