Creating an AWS OpsWorks Stacks Administrative User
You can create an AWS OpsWorks Stacks administrative user by attaching an IAM policy to a user that grants AWS OpsWorks Stacks Full Access permissions. This procedure assumes that you will create a new IAM user for this purpose. For existing users, simply add the policy to the user as described in Step 4.
To create the IAM User


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


On the IAM console, choose Users in the navigation pane, and then choose Add user.


Type a user name. In the Select AWS access type area, select Programmatic access, and then choose Next: Permissions.


On the Set permissions page, choose Attach existing policies directly.


Enter OpsWorks in the Policy type filter box to display the AWS OpsWorks policies, select AWSOpsWorksFullAccess, and then choose Next: review. This policy grants your user rights to perform all tasks in AWS OpsWorks.



On the Review page, choose Create user.


Choose Download .csv, save the credentials file to a convenient location on your system, and then choose Close.
Note
The AWSOpsWorksFullAccess policy allows users to create and manage AWS OpsWorks Stacks stacks, but users cannot create an IAM service role for the stack; they must use an existing role. The first user to create a stack must have additional IAM permissions, as described in  Administrative Permissions. When this user creates the first stack, AWS OpsWorks Stacks creates an IAM service role with the required permissions. Thereafter, any user with opsworks:CreateStack permissions can use that role to create additional stacks. For more information, see Allowing AWS OpsWorks Stacks to Act on Your Behalf.


Attach additional customer-managed policies to fine-tune the user's permissions, as needed. For example, you might want an administrative user to be able to create or delete stacks, but not import new users. For more information, see Managing AWS OpsWorks Stacks Permissions by Attaching an IAM PolicyAttaching an IAM Policy.


If you have multiple administrative users, instead of setting permissions separately for each user, you can attach an AWSOpsWorksFullAccess policy to an IAM group and add the users to that group. 
 To create a new group, choose Groups in the navigation pane, and then choose Create New Group. In the Create New Group Wizard, name your group and specify the AWSOpsWorksFullAccess policy. You can also specify the AdministratorAccess policy, which includes the AWSOpsWorksFullAccess permissions.
 To add full AWS OpsWorks Stacks permissions to an existing group, choose Groups in the navigation pane, select the group, and then choose the Permissions tab. Choose Attach Policy or Attach Another Policy. In the Manage Group Permissions wizard, select the AWSOpsWorksFullAccess policy.
