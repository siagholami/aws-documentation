aws opsworks --region us-west-1 create-deployment --stack-id cfb7e082-ad1d-4599-8e81-de1c39ab45bf
   --app-id 307be5c8-d55d-47b5-bd6e-7bd417c6c7eb --command "{\"Name\":\"deploy\"}"
The arguments are as follows:
 stack-id – You can get the stack ID from the stack's settings page on the console (look for OpsWorks ID) or by calling describe-stacks.
 app-id – You can get app ID from the app's details page (look for OpsWorks ID) or by calling describe-apps.
 command – The argument takes a JSON object that sets the command name to deploy, which deploys the specified app to the stack. 
Notice that the " characters in the JSON object are all escaped. Otherwise, the command might return an error that the JSON is invalid.
The command returns a JSON object that contains the deployment ID, as follows:
{
    "DeploymentId": "5746c781-df7f-4c87-84a7-65a119880560"
}
Note
The preceding example deploys to every instance in the stack. To deploy to a specified subset of instances, add an instance-ids argument and list the instance IDs.
