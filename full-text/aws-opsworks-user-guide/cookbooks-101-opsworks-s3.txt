Using the SDK for Ruby: Downloading Files from Amazon S3
There are some tasks, such as interacting with AWS services, that cannot be handled with Chef resources. For example, it is sometimes preferable to store files remotely and have a recipe download them to the instance. You can use the remote_file resource to download files from remote servers. However, if you want to store your files in an Amazon S3 bucket, remote_file can download those files only if the ACL allows the operation.
Recipes can use the AWS SDK for Ruby to access most AWS services. This topic shows how to use the SDK for Ruby to download a file from an S3 bucket.
