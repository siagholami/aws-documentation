MySQL Layer Reference
Note
This layer is available only for Linux-based stacks.
The MySQL layer supports MySQL, a widely used relational database management system. AWS OpsWorks Stacks installs the most recent available version, which depends on the operating system. If you add a MySQL instance, the needed access information is provided to the application server layers. You must write custom Chef recipes to set up master–master or master–slave configurations. 
Short name: db-master
