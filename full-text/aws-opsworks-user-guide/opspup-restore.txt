Restore an OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise Server from a Backup
After browsing through your available backups, you can easily choose a point in time from which to restore your OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise server. Server backups contain configuration-management software persistent data such as modules, classes, node associations, database information (including reports, facts, etc.). Performing an in-place restoration of a server (that is, restoring to the same EC2 instance) reregisters nodes that were registered at the time of the backup that you use to restore the server. Restoring a server does not update the version of Puppet software; it applies the same Puppet versions and configuration-management data that are available in the backup that you choose.
In this release, you can use the AWS CLI to restore a Puppet master in OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise.
Note
You can also run the restore-server command to change the current instance type, or to restore or set your SSH key if it is lost or compromised.
To restore a server from a backup

In the AWS CLI, run the following command to return a list of available backups and their IDs. Make a note of the ID of the backup that you want to use. Backup IDs are in the format myServerName-yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS.

aws opsworks-cm --region region name describe-backups

Run the following command.

aws opsworks-cm --region region name restore-server --backup-id "myServerName-yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS" --instance-type "Type of instance" --key-pair "name of your EC2 key pair" --server-name "name of Puppet master"
The following is an example.
aws opsworks-cm --region us-west-2 restore-server --backup-id "MyPuppetServer-20161120122143125" --server-name "MyPuppetServer"

Wait until restoration is complete.
