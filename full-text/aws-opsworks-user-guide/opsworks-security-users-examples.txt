Example Policies
This section shows some examples of IAM policies that can be attached to AWS OpsWorks Stacks users. 
  Administrative Permissions shows two policies that can be used to grant permissions to administrative users.
  Manage Permissions and  Deploy Permissions show examples of policies that can be attached to a user to augment or restrict the Manage and Deploy permissions levels.
AWS OpsWorks Stacks determines the user's permissions by evaluating the permissions granted by attached IAM policies as well as the permissions granted by the Permissions page. For more information, see Overview of AWS IAM Permissions. For more information on the Permissions page permissions, see AWS OpsWorks Stacks Permissions LevelsPermissions Levels.
Administrative Permissions
The following is the AWSOpsWorksFullAccess policy, which can be attached to a user to grant them permissions to perform all AWS OpsWorks Stacks actions. The IAM permissions are required, among other things, to allow an administrative user to import users.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "opsworks:*",
        "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
        "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
        "ec2:DescribeAccountAttributes",
        "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
        "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
        "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeInstanceHealth",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
        "iam:GetRolePolicy",
        "iam:ListRoles",
        "iam:ListInstanceProfiles",
        "iam:PassRole",
        "iam:ListUsers"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
You must create an IAM role that allows AWS OpsWorks Stacks to act on your behalf to access other AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances. You typically handle this task by having an administrative user create the first stack, and letting AWS OpsWorks Stacks create the role for you. You can then use that role for all subsequent stacks. For more information, see Allowing AWS OpsWorks Stacks to Act on Your Behalf.
The administrative user who creates the first stack must have permissions for some IAM actions that are not included in the AWSOpsWorksFullAccess policy, as follows:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "opsworks:*",
        "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
        "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
        "ec2:DescribeAccountAttributes",
        "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
        "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
        "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeInstanceHealth",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
        "iam:GetRolePolicy",
        "iam:ListRoles",
        "iam:ListInstanceProfiles",
        "iam:PassRole",
        "iam:ListUsers",
        "iam:PutRolePolicy",
        "iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile",
        "iam:CreateInstanceProfile",
        "iam:CreateRole"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Manage Permissions
The Manage permissions level allows a user to perform a variety of stack management actions, including adding or deleting layers. This topic describes several policies that you can attach to Manage users to augment or restrict the standard permissions.
Deny a Manage user the ability to add or delete layers
You can restrict the Manage permissions level to allow a user perform all Manage actions except adding or deleting layers by attaching the following IAM policy.  
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "opsworks:CreateLayer",
        "opsworks:DeleteLayer"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Allow a Manage user to create or clone stacks
The Manage permissions level doesn't allow users to create or clone stacks. You can augment the Manage permissions to allow a user to create or clone stacks by attaching the following IAM policy.  
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "opsworks:CreateStack", 
      "opsworks:CloneStack"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
  }
  ]
}
Deny a Manage user the ability to register or deregister resources
The Manage permissions level allows the user to register and deregister Amazon EBS and Elastic IP address resources with the stack. You can restrict the Manage permissions to allow the user to perform all Manage actions except registering resources by attaching the following policy.  
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "opsworks:RegisterVolume",
        "opsworks:RegisterElasticIp"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Allow a Manage user to import users
The Manage permissions level doesn't allow users to import users into AWS OpsWorks Stacks. You can augment the Manage permissions to allow a user to import and delete users by attaching the following IAM policy.  
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:GetRolePolicy",
        "iam:ListRoles",
        "iam:ListInstanceProfiles",
        "iam:ListUsers",
        "iam:PassRole",
        "iam:ListInstanceProfiles",
        "opsworks:DescribeUserProfiles",
        "opsworks:CreateUserProfile",
        "opsworks:DeleteUserProfile"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Deploy Permissions
The Deploy permissions level doesn't allow users to create or delete apps. You can augment the Deploy permissions to allow a user to create and delete apps by attaching the following IAM policy.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "opsworks:CreateApp",
        "opsworks:DeleteApp"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
