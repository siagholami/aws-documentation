Resource Management
The Resources page enables you to use your account's Elastic IP address, Amazon EBS volume, or Amazon RDS instance resources in an AWS OpsWorks Stacks stack. You can use Resources to do the following:
 Register a resource with a stack, which allows you to attach the resource to one of the stack's instances.
 Attach a resource to one of the stack's instances.
 Move a resource from one instance to another.
 Detach a resource from an instance. The resource remains registered and can be attached to another instance.
 Deregister a resource. An unregistered resource cannot be used by AWS OpsWorks Stacks, but it remains in your account unless you delete it, and can be registered with another stack.
Note the following constraints:
 You cannot attach registered Amazon EBS volumes to Windows instances.
 The Resources page manages standard, PIOPS, Throughput Optimized HDD, Cold HDD, or General Purpose (SSD) Amazon EBS volumes, but not RAID arrays.
 Amazon EBS volumes must be xfs formatted.
AWS OpsWorks Stacks does not support other file formats, such as ext4. For more information on preparing Amazon EBS volumes, see Making an Amazon EBS Volume Available for Use.
 You can't attach an Amazon EBS volume to—or detach it from—a running instance.
You can operate only on offline instances. For example, you can register an in-use volume with a stack and attach it to an offline instance, but you must stop the original instance and detach the volume before starting the new instance. Otherwise, the start process will fail.
 You can attach an Elastic IP address to and detach it from a running instance.
You can operate on online or offline instances. For example, you can register an in-use address and assign it to a running instance, and AWS OpsWorks Stacks will automatically reassign the address.
 To register and deregister resources, your IAM policy must grant permissions for the following actions:   
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
The Manage permissions level grants permissions for all of these actions. To prevent a Manage user from registering or deregistering particular resources, edit their IAM policy to deny permissions for the appropriate actions. For more information, see Security and Permissions.
