Editing AWS OpsWorks Stacks User Settings
After you have imported users, you can edit their settings, as follows:
To edit user settings


On the Users page, choose edit in the user's Actions column.


You can specify the following settings.
Self Management
Select Yes to allow the user to use the MySettings page to specify his or her personal SSH key. 
You can also enable self-management by attaching an IAM policy to the user that grants permissions for the DescribeMyUserProfile and UpdateMyUserProfile actions. 
Public SSH key
(Optional) Enter a public SSH key for the user. This key will appear on the user's My Settings page. If you enable self-management, the user can edit My Settings and specify his or her own key. For more information, see Registering an IAM User's Public SSH Key.
AWS OpsWorks Stacks installs this key on all Linux instances; users can use the associated private key to log in. For more information, see Logging In with SSH. You cannot use this key with Windows stacks.
Permissions
(Optional) Set the user's permissions levels for each stack in one place instead of setting them separately by using each stack's Permissions page. For more information on permissions levels, see Granting Per-Stack Permissions.
