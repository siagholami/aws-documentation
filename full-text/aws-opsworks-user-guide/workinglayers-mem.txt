Memcached
Note
This layer is available only for for Chef 11 and earlier Linux-based stacks.
A Memcached layer is an AWS OpsWorks Stacks layer that provides a blueprint for instances that function as Memcached serversâ€”a distributed memory-caching system for arbitrary data. The Memcached layer includes the following configuration settings.
Allocated memory (MB)
(Optional) The amount of cache memory (in MB) for each of the layer's instances. The default is 512 MB.
Custom security groups
This setting appears if you chose to not automatically associate a built-in AWS OpsWorks Stacks security group with your layers. You must specify which security group to associate with the layer. For more information, see Create a New Stack.
