Step 6: Deploy and run the App
This example assumes that you have Ruby on Rails application that uses Redis. To access the configuration file, you can add the redis gem to your Gemfile and create a Rails initializer in config/initializers/redis.rb as follows:
REDIS_CONFIG = YAML::load_file(Rails.root.join('config', 'redis.yml'))
$redis = Redis.new(:host => REDIS_CONFIG['host'], :port => REDIS_CONFIG['port'])
Then create an app to represent your application and deploy it to the Rails App Server layer's instances, which updates the application code and runs generate.rb to generate the configuration file. When you run the application, it will use the ElastiCache Redis instance as its in-memory key-value store.
