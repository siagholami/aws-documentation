App Data Bag (aws_opsworks_app)
For a Deploy event or an Execute Recipes stack command, represents an app's settings.
The following example shows how to use Chef search to search through a single data bag item and then multiple data bag items to write messages to the Chef log with the apps' short names and source URLs:
```
app = search("aws_opsworks_app").first
Chef::Log.info("* The app's short name is '#{app['shortname']}' *")
Chef::Log.info("* The app's URL is '#{app['app_source']['url']}' *")
search("aws_opsworks_app").each do |app|
  Chef::Log.info("* The app's short name is '#{app['shortname']}' *")
  Chef::Log.info("* The app's URL is '#{app['app_source']['url']}' *")
end
```

app_id 
The app ID (string). A GUID that identifies the app.
app_source 
A set of content that specifies the information that AWS OpsWorks Stacks uses to deploy the app from its source control repository. The content varies depending on the repository type.  
password
The password for private repositories, and "null" for public repositories (string). For private  S3 buckets, this content is set to the secret key.
revision
If the repository has multiple branches, the content specifies the app's branch or version, such as "version1" (string). Otherwise, it is set to "null".
ssh_key
A deploy SSH key for accessing private Git repositories, and "null" for public repositories (string).
type
The app's source location (string). Valid values include:
 "archive"
 "git"
 "other"
 "s3"
url
Where the app source is located (string).
user
The user name for private repositories, and "null" for public repositories (string). For private S3 buckets, the content is set to the access key.
attributes 
A set of content that describes the directory structure and content of the app.  
document_root 
The root directory of the document tree. Defines the path to the document root–or the location of the app's home page, such as home_html–that is relative to your deployment directory. Unless this attribute is specified, the document_root defaults to public. The value of document_root can start only with a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ (underscore) or - (hyphen) characters.
data_sources 
The information required to connect to the app's database. If the app has an attached database layer, AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically assigns the appropriate values to this content.
The value of data_sources is an array, and arrays are accessed by an integral offset, not by key. For example, to access the app's first data source, use app[:data_sources][0][:type].  
database_name
The database name, which is typically the app's short name (string).
type
The database instance's type, typically "RdsDbInstance" (string).
arn
The database instance's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) (string).
deploy 
Whether the app should be deployed (Boolean). true for apps that should be deployed in a Deploy lifecycle event. In a Setup lifecycle event, this content will be true for all apps. To determine which apps should be deployed on an instance, check the layers to which the instance belongs.
domains 
A list of the app's domains (list of strings).
enable_ssl 
Whether SSL support is enabled (Boolean).
environment 
A collection of user-specified environment variables that have been defined for the app. For more information about how to define an app's environment variables, see Adding Apps. Each content name is set to an environment variable name and the corresponding value is set to the variable's value.
name 
The app's name, which is used for display purposes (string).
shortname 
The app's short name, which is generated by AWS OpsWorks Stacks from the name (string). The shortname is used internally and by recipes; it is used as the name of the directory where your app files are installed.
ssl_configuration 
certificate
If you enabled SSL support, the app's SSL certificate; otherwise, "null" (string).
chain
If SSL is enabled, content for specifying an intermediate certificate authority key or client authentication (string).
private_key
If you enabled SSL support, the app's SSL private key; otherwise, "null" (string).
type 
The app's type, which is always set to "other" for Chef 12 Linux and Chef 12.2 Windows stacks (string).
