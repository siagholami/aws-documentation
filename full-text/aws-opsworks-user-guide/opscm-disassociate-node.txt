Disassociate a Node from an AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate Server
This section describes how to disassociate, or remove, a managed node from management by an AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate server. This operation is performed on the command line; you cannot disassociate nodes in the AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate management console. Currently, the AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate API does not allow for batch removal of multiple nodes. The command in this section disassociates one node at a time.
We recommend that you disassociate nodes from a Chef server before you delete the server, so that the nodes continue to operate without trying to reconnect with the server. To do this, run the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks-cm/latest/APIReference/API_DisassociateNode.html AWS CLI command.
To disassociate nodes

In the AWS CLI, run the following command to disassociate nodes. Node_name is the name of the node that you want to disassociate; for Amazon EC2 instances, this is the instance ID. Server_name is the name of the Chef server from which you want to disassociate the node. --engine-attributes specifies your default CHEF_ORGANIZATION name. All three of these parameters are required.

The --region parameter is not required unless you want to disassociate a node from a Chef server that is not in your default region.
aws opsworks-cm --region Region_name disassociate-node --node-name Node_name --server-name Server_name --engine-attributes "Name=CHEF_ORGANIZATION,Value='default'"
The following command is an example.
aws opsworks-cm --region us-west-2 disassociate-node --node-name i-0010zzz00d66zzz90 --server-name opsworkstest --engine-attributes "Name=CHEF_ORGANIZATION,Value='default'"

Wait until a response message indicates that the disassociation is finished.

After you successfully disassociate a node from an AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate server, it might still be visible in the Chef Automate dashboard. By default, Chef enforces a retention period for node state information, and purges the node automatically after a few days. For more information about data retention management and the Chef Reaper tool, see Data Retention Management in the Chef documentation.
