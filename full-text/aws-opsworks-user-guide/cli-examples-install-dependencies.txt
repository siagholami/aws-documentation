Install Dependencies (create-deployment)
Use the create-deployment command to execute stack commands and deployment commands. The following example runs the update_dependencies stack command to update the dependencies on a stack's instances.
aws opsworks --region us-west-1 create-deployment --stack-id 935450cc-61e0-4b03-a3e0-160ac817d2bb 
--command "{\"Name\":\"install_dependencies\"}"
The command argument takes a JSON object with a Name parameter whose value specifies the command name, install_dependencies for this example. Notice that the " characters in the JSON object are all escaped. Otherwise, the command might return an error that the JSON is invalid.
The command returns a deployment ID, which you can use to identify the command for other CLI commands such as describe-commands.
{
    "DeploymentId": "aef5b255-8604-4928-81b3-9b0187f962ff"
}
