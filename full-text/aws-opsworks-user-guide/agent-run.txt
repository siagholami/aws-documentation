run_command
Runs an AWS OpsWorks Stacks command, which is a JSON file containing a Chef run-list that contains the information necessary to execute an AWS OpsWorks Stacks activity (setup, configure, deploy, and so on). The run_command command generates a log entry that you can view by running  show_log . This option is intended only for development purposes, so AWS OpsWorks Stacks does not track changes. 
sudo opsworks-agent-cli run_command [activity] [date] [/path/to/valid/json.file]
By default, run_command runs the most recent AWS OpsWorks Stacks command. Use the following options to specify a particular command.
activity
Run a specified AWS OpsWorks Stacks command: setup, configure, deploy, undeploy, start, stop, or restart.
date
Run the AWS OpsWorks command that executed at the specified timestamp. To get a list of valid timestamps, run  list_commands.
file
Run the specified command JSON file. To get a command's file path, run  get_json.
The following output example is from an instance and runs the configure command.
```
$ sudo opsworks-agent-cli run_command configure
