Step 9: Update the Cookbook to Run a Command
Update your cookbook by adding a recipe that runs a command that creates an SSH key on the instance. 
To update the cookbook on the instance and run the new recipe

On your local workstation, in the recipes subdirectory in the opsworks_cookbook_demo directory, create a file named run_command.rb with the following code. For more information, go to execute.

execute "Create an SSH key" do
     command "ssh-keygen -f /tmp/my-key -N fLyC3jbY"
   end


At the terminal or command prompt, use the tar command create a new version of the opsworks_cookbook_demo.tar.gz file, which contains the opsworks_cookbook_demo directory and its updated contents.


Upload the updated opsworks_cookbook_demo.tar.gz file to your S3 bucket.


Follow the procedures in Step 5: Update the Cookbook on the Instance and Run the Recipe to update the cookbook on the instance and to run the recipe. In the "To run the recipe" procedure, for Recipes to execute, type opsworks_cookbook_demo::run_command.


To test the recipe


Log in to the instance, if you have not done so already.


From the command prompt, run the following commands, one at a time, to confirm that the SSH key was created:


```
   sudo cat /tmp/my-key
sudo cat /tmp/my-key.pub
   ```
The SSH private and public key's contents are displayed:
```
   -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
   Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
   DEK-Info: AES-128-CBC,DEF7A09C...541583FA
   A5p9dCuo...wp0YYH1c
   -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...KaNogZkT root@cookbooks-demo1
   ```
In the next step, you will update the cookbook to run a script on the instance.
