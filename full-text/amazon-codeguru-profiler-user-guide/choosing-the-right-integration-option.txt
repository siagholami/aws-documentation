Choosing the right integration option
You can load the CodeGuru Profiler agent into your JVM-based application in two ways:


Command line – Use the -javaagent command line option when starting your application.


Code – Add the CodeGuru Profiler agent into your application code.


The same functionality is available in either option. Choosing the right option for your situation depends on the following: 
To quickly start profiling your existing JVM-based application, the command line option might be best because it doesn't require recompiling your application.
For more control over when to start profiling, or in rare cases where you need to provide a custom authentication provider, you might want to choose the code option.
The following table helps summarize these options.



Option
Command line
Code




Profile existing application
Yes
No (requires re-compile)


Custom authentication provider
No
Yes


Control when profiling starts
No (profiling begins at startup)
Yes


Automatic updates
No (requires download)
Yes (at next re-compile)



You can always choose a different option later. All of the profiling data is stored in the CodeGuru Profiler service, and is available even when switching the CodeGuru Profiler agent.
