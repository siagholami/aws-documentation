Zooming in on a frame
Clicking a frame zooms in on the function. The frame becomes the new "base" of the visualization. The visualization shows callees of the selected function. Only the functions in the call chain leading to the call of the selected function are displayed. 
You can zoom in on any visible frame.
To zoom back out, choose ALL. In a Hotspots visualization, ALL is located at the top of the visualization. In an Overview visualization, it's at the bottom.
