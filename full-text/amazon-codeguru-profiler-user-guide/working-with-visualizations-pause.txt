Pausing over a frame
One of the easiest ways to begin exploring visualization data is by pausing over the visualization. When you pause over a frame, all frames with the same function name are highlighted. This makes it easy to see where and how often the function is called. 
You can also see details about the function. CodeGuru Profiler displays the name of the function, how much time it has run on the CPU in that stack frame, and the sample time spent in the selected thread states.
