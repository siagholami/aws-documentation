Operate Your AWS DeepRacer Vehicle
After you finish training and evaluating an AWS DeepRacer model in the AWS DeepRacer simulator, you can deploy the model to your AWS DeepRacer vehicle. You can set the vehicle to drive on a track and evaluate the model's performance in a physical environment. This mimics a real-world autonomous race. 
Before driving your vehicle for the first time, you must set up the vehicle, install software updates, and calibrate its drive-chain sub-system. 
To drive your vehicle on a physical track, you must have a track. For more information, see Build Your Physical Track for AWS DeepRacer
