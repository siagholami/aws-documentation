Build Your Physical Track for AWS DeepRacer
This section describes how you can build a physical track for a AWS DeepRacer model. To drive your AWS DeepRacer autonomously and to test your reinforcement learning model in a physical environment, you need a physical track. Your track resembles the simulated track used in training and replicates the environment used to train the deployed AWS DeepRacer model.
