Participate in AWS DeepRacer Virtual Races
After successfully training and evaluating your model in simulations, you may want to compare your model's performance to other racers' models. The comparison can help you measure the fitness of your model. To support this, AWS DeepRacer lets you organize your own community races for users to participate, in addition to the AWS-sponsored AWS DeepRacer League racing events. The races can be online (virtual) or in-person. This section discusses how to participate in an AWS DeepRacer League Virtual Circuit race or a community-based virtual race. 
When participating in an online race, you submit your model to the virtual leaderboard of the racing event. The AWS DeepRacer console will choose the most optimal version of your model during the training job simulation. It automatically picks your best model by cycling between training and checkpoint evaluations. If the evaluation of your model passes the specified racing criteria, the result displayed on the leaderboard and the performance ranked against other participants.
