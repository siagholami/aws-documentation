AWS DeepRacer Identity-Based Policies
With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. AWS DeepRacer supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference in the IAM User Guide.
Actions
The Action element of an IAM identity-based policy describes the specific action or actions that will be allowed or denied by the policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. The action is used in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation. 
Resources
AWS DeepRacer does not support specifying resource ARNs in a policy.
Condition Keys
AWS DeepRacer does not provide any service-specific condition keys, but it does support using some global condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS Global Condition Context Keys in the IAM User Guide. 
AWS DeepRacer Resource-Based Policies
AWS DeepRacer does not support resource-based policies. To view an example of a detailed resource-based policy page, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html.
