Connecting to a NICE DCV Session Using the Linux Client
The steps for connecting to a NICE DCV session are the same across all Linux clients.
To connect to a session using the Linux client


Launch the Linux client.


Choose Connections Settings, configure your proxy settings as follows, and then choose Apply.
    To avoid connecting through a proxy, choose Connect directly.
    To connect to the NICE DCV server using your preconfigured operating system proxy settings, choose Use system proxy.
    To connect to the NICE DCV server through a specific HTTP proxy server, choose Get through web proxy (HTTP). Specify the proxy server's hostname or IP address, and communication port. If the HTTP proxy server requires authentication, select the Proxy server requiring password check box and enter your user name and password.
    To connect to the NICE DCV server through a specific HTTPS proxy server, choose Get through web proxy (HTTPS). Specify the proxy server's hostname or IP address, and communication port. If the web proxy server requires authentication, select the Proxy server requiring password check box and enter your user name and password.


Specify the session details in the following format:


server_hostname_or_IP:port#session_id
For example, the following connects to a session named my-session, which is hosted on a NICE DCV server with the hostname my-dcv-server.com, over port 8443:
my-dcv-server.com:8443#my-session


Choose Connect.


Enter your user name and password and choose Login.
Note
By default, the connection is terminated after three unsuccessful login attempts. To try again, restart the connection.


If you are prompted to verify the server's certificate, confirm the certificate's fingerprint with your NICE DCV administrator. If the fingerprint is valid, choose Trust.
