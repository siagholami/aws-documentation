Booting from the wrong volume
In some situations, you may find that a volume other than the volume attached to /dev/xvda or /dev/sda has become the root volume of your instance. This can happen when you have attached the root volume of another instance, or a volume created from the snapshot of a root volume, to an instance with an existing root volume.
This is due to how the initial ramdisk in Linux works. It chooses the volume defined as / in the /etc/fstab, and in some distributions, this is determined by the label attached to the volume partition. Specifically, you find that your /etc/fstab looks something like the following: 
LABEL=/ / ext4 defaults,noatime 1 1 
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults 0 0 
devpts /dev/pts devpts gid=5,mode=620 0 0 
sysfs /sys sysfs defaults 0 0 
proc /proc proc defaults 0 0
If you check the label of both volumes, you see that they both contain the / label: 
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo e2label /dev/xvda1 
/ 
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo e2label /dev/xvdf1 
/
In this example, you could end up having /dev/xvdf1 become the root device that your instance boots to after the initial ramdisk runs, instead of the /dev/xvda1 volume from which you had intended to boot. To solve this, use the same e2label command to change the label of the attached volume that you do not want to boot from.
In some cases, specifying a UUID in /etc/fstab can resolve this. However, if both volumes come from the same snapshot, or the secondary is created from a snapshot of the primary volume, they share a UUID.
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo blkid 
/dev/xvda1: LABEL="/" UUID=73947a77-ddbe-4dc7-bd8f-3fe0bc840778 TYPE="ext4" PARTLABEL="Linux" PARTUUID=d55925ee-72c8-41e7-b514-7084e28f7334 
/dev/xvdf1: LABEL="old/" UUID=73947a77-ddbe-4dc7-bd8f-3fe0bc840778 TYPE="ext4" PARTLABEL="Linux" PARTUUID=d55925ee-72c8-41e7-b514-7084e28f7334
To change the label of an attached ext4 volume

Use the e2label command to change the label of the volume to something other than /.

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo e2label /dev/xvdf1 old/

Verify that the volume has the new label.

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo e2label /dev/xvdf1 
   old/
To change the label of an attached xfs volume
 Use the xfs_admin command to change the label of the volume to something other than /.
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo xfs_admin -L old/ /dev/xvdf1
  writing all SBs
  new label = "old/"
After changing the volume label as shown, you should be able to reboot the instance and have the proper volume selected by the initial ramdisk when the instance boots.
Important
If you intend to detach the volume with the new label and return it to another instance to use as the root volume, you must perform the above procedure again and change the volume label back to its original value. Otherwise, the other instance does not boot because the ramdisk is unable to find the volume with the label /.
