Troubleshooting stopping your instance
If you have stopped your Amazon EBS-backed instance and it appears stuck in the stopping state, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer.
There is no cost for any instance usage while an instance is not in the running state.
Force the instance to stop using either the console or the AWS CLI.
 To force the instance to stop using the console, select the stuck instance, and choose Actions, Instance State, Stop, and Yes, Forcefully Stop.
 To force the instance to stop using the AWS CLI, use the stop-instances command and the --force option as follows:
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-0123ab456c789d01e --force
If, after 10 minutes, the instance has not stopped, post a request for help in the Amazon EC2 forum. To help expedite a resolution, include the instance ID, and describe the steps that you've already taken. Alternatively, if you have a support plan, create a technical support case in the Support Center.
Creating a replacement instance
To attempt to resolve the problem while you are waiting for assistance from the Amazon EC2 forum or the Support Center, create a replacement instance. Create an AMI of the stuck instance, and launch a new instance using the new AMI. 
To create a replacement instance using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances and select the stuck instance.


Choose Actions, Image, Create Image.


In the Create Image dialog box, fill in the following fields, and then choose Create Image:


Specify a name and description for the AMI.


Choose No reboot.


For more information, see Creating a Linux AMI from an instance.


Launch a new instance from the AMI and verify that the new instance is working.


Select the stuck instance, and choose Actions, Instance State, Terminate. If the instance also gets stuck terminating, Amazon EC2 automatically forces it to terminate within a few hours.


To create a replacement instance using the CLI

Create an AMI from the stuck instance using the create-image (AWS CLI) command and the --no-reboot option as follows:.

aws ec2 create-image --instance-id i-0123ab456c789d01e --name "AMI" --description "AMI for replacement instance" --no-reboot

Launch a new instance from the AMI using the run-instances (AWS CLI) command as follows:

aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-1a2b3c4d --count 1 --instance-type c3.large --key-name MyKeyPair --security-groups MySecurityGroup


Verify that the new instance is working.


Terminate the stuck instance using the terminate-instances (AWS CLI) command as follows:


aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
If you are unable to create an AMI from the instance as described in the previous procedures, you can set up a replacement instance as follows:
(Alternate) To create a replacement instance using the console


Select the instance and choose Description, Block devices. Select each volume and write down its volume ID. Be sure to note which volume is the root volume.


In the navigation pane, choose Volumes. Select each volume for the instance, and choose Actions, Create Snapshot.


In the navigation pane, choose Snapshots. Select the snapshot that you just created, and choose Actions, Create Volume.


Launch an instance with the same operating system as the stuck instance. Note the volume ID and device name of its root volume.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances, select the instance that you just launched, choose Actions, Instance State, and then choose Stop.


In the navigation pane, choose Volumes, select the root volume of the stopped instance, and choose Actions, Detach Volume.


Select the root volume that you created from the stuck instance, choose Actions, Attach Volume, and attach it to the new instance as its root volume (using the device name that you wrote down). Attach any additional non-root volumes to the instance.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances and select the replacement instance. Choose Actions, Instance State, Start. Verify that the instance is working.


Select the stuck instance, choose Actions, Instance State, Terminate. If the instance also gets stuck terminating, Amazon EC2 automatically forces it to terminate within a few hours.
