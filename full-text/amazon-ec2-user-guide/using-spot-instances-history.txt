Spot Instance pricing history
When you request Spot Instances, we recommend that you use the default maximum price (the On-Demand price). If you want to specify a maximum price, we recommend that you review the Spot price history before you do so. You can view the Spot price history for the last 90 days, filtering by instance type, operating system, and Availability Zone.
Spot Instance prices are set by Amazon EC2 and adjust gradually based on long-term trends in supply and demand for Spot Instance capacity. For the current Spot Instance prices see Amazon EC2 Spot Instances Pricing.
To view the Spot price history (console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Spot Requests.


If you are new to Spot Instances, you see a welcome page. Choose Get started, scroll to the bottom of the screen, and then choose Cancel.


Choose Pricing history. 


Choose the operating system (Product), Instance type, and Date range for which to view the price history. Move your pointer over the graph to display the prices at specific times in the selected date range.



(Optional) To review the Spot price history for a specific Availability Zone, you can filter the Availability Zones by removing Availability Zones from the graph.
