Step 4: Delete Your Amazon CloudSearch Movies Domain
When you are finished experimenting with your movies domain, you must delete it to avoid incurring additional usage fees. 
Important
Deleting a domain deletes the index associated with the domain and takes the domain's document and search endpoints offline permanently.
To delete your imdb-movies domain


Go to the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home.


In the Navigation panel, click the name of your movies domain to view to the domain dashboard. 


At the top of the domain dashboard, click the Delete this Domain button.


In the Delete Domain dialog box, select the Delete the domain option and click OK to permanently remove the domain and all of its data.


Note
It can take around 15 minutes to delete the domain and its resources. Until then, the domain status will be BEING DELETED.
