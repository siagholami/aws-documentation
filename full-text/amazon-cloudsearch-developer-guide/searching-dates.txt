Searching for Dates and Times in Amazon CloudSearch
You can use structured queries to search any search enabled date field for a particular date and time or a date-time range. Amazon CloudSearch supports two date field types, date and date-array. For more information, see Configuring Index Fields.
Dates and times are specified in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) according to IETF RFC3339: yyyy-mm-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ. In UTC, for example, 5:00 PM August 23, 1970 is: 1970-08-23T17:00:00Z. Note that you can also specify fractional seconds when specifying times in UTC. For example, 1967-01-31T23:20:50.650Z. 
To search for a date (or time) in a date field, you must enclose the date string in single quotes. For example, both of the following queries search the movie data for all movies released at midnight on December 25, 2001:
q.parser=structured&q=release_date:'2001-12-25T00:00:00Z'
q.parser=structured&q=(term field%3Drelease_date '2001-12-25T00:00:00Z')
To search an entire day, see Searching for a Date Range.
