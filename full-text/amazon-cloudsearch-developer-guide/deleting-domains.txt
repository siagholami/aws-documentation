Deleting an Amazon CloudSearch Domain
If you are no longer using a search domain, you must delete it to avoid incurring additional usage fees. You will still be charged for a domain even if it does not contain any documentsâ€”deleting all documents does not delete the domain. Deleting a domain deletes the index associated with the domain and takes the domain's document and search endpoints offline permanently. It can take some time to completely remove a domain and decommission all of its resources. Small domains are typically deleted in a short amount of time, while especially large domains may require an extended amount of time to be deleted. During this process, the domain status is set to BEING DELETED and your account is not charged. 
You can delete a domain from the Amazon CloudSearch console, using the aws cloudsearch delete-domain command, or using the AWS SDKs.
