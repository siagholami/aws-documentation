Step 2: Create rules
Note
This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet. To migrate your resources, see Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF .
For the latest version of AWS WAF, see AWS WAF. 
In this step, you create rules using AWS WAF Classic. If you already have AWS WAF Classic rules that you want to use with AWS Firewall Manager, skip this step and go to Step 3: Create a rule group. 
Note
Use the AWS WAF Classic console to create your rules. 
To create AWS WAF Classic rules (console)
 Create your rules, and then add your conditions to your rules. For more information, see Creating a rule and adding conditions. 
You are now ready to go to Step 3: Create a rule group.
