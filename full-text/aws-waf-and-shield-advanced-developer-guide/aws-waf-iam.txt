AWS Identity and Access Management
AWS WAF integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), a service that lets your organization do the following:
 Create users and groups under your organization's AWS account
 Share your AWS account resources with users in the account
 Assign unique security credentials to each user
 Control user access to services and resources
For example, you can use IAM with AWS WAF to control which users in your AWS account can create a new web ACL.
For general information about IAM, see the following documentation:
