Managing your own rule groups
You can create your own rule group to reuse collections of rules that you either don't find in the managed rule group offerings or that you prefer to handle on your own. When you create your own rule group, you must set an immutable maximum capacity for it. 
Rule groups that you create hold rules just like a web ACL does, and you add rules to a rule group in the same way as you do to a web ACL.
