Step 4: Configure Amazon SNS notifications and Amazon CloudWatch alarms
You can monitor your protected resources for potential DDoS activity using Amazon SNS. To receive notification of possible attacks, create an Amazon SNS topic for each Region.
To create an Amazon SNS topic in Firewall Manager (console)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console using the Firewall Manager administrator account that you set up in the prerequisites, and then open the Firewall Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/fms. 
Note
For information about setting up a Firewall Manager administrator account, see Step 2: Set the AWS Firewall Manager administrator account.


In the navigation pane, under AWS FMS, choose Settings.


Choose Create new topic.


Enter a topic name.


Enter an email address that the Amazon SNS messages will be sent to, and then choose Add email address.


Choose Update SNS configuration.


You can continue from this step without configuring Amazon SNS notifications or CloudWatch alarms. However, doing so significantly reduces your visibility of possible DDoS events.
As a final step for getting started with Firewall Manager and Shield Advanced, review the global threat dashboard, as described in Step 5: Monitor the global threat dashboard .
