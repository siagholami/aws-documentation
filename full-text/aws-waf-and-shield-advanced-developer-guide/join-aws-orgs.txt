Step 1: Join AWS Organizations
To use Firewall Manager, your account must be a member of an organization in the AWS Organizations service. If your account is already a member, you can skip this step and go to Step 2: Set the AWS Firewall Manager administrator account.
Note
AWS Organizations has two available feature sets: consolidated billing features and all features. To use Firewall Manager, the organization that you belong to must be enabled for all features. If your organization is configured only for consolidated billing, see Enabling All Features in Your Organization.
If your account is not part of an organization, create or join an organization as described in Creating and Managing an AWS Organizations.
After your account is a member of an organization, go to Step 2: Set the AWS Firewall Manager administrator account.
