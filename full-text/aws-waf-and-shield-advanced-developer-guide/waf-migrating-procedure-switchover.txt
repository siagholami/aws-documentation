Migrating a web ACL: switchover
After you've verified your new web ACL settings, you can start to use it in place of your AWS WAF Classic web ACL. 
Note
You might encounter a brief disruption as you change the resource association to the new web ACL.
To begin using your new AWS WAF web ACL


Associate the AWS WAF web ACL with the resources that you want to protect, following the guidance at Associating or disassociating a Web ACL with an AWS resource. This automatically disassociates the resources from the old web ACL. 


Configure logging for the new web ACL, following the guidance at Logging Web ACL traffic information. 


(Optional) If your AWS WAF Classic web ACL is no longer associated with any resources, consider removing it entirely from AWS WAF Classic. For information, see Deleting a Web ACL.
