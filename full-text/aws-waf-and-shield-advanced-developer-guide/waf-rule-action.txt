AWS WAF rule action
The rule action tells AWS WAF what to do with a web request when it matches the criteria defined in the rule. 
Here are the rule action options: 
 Count – AWS WAF counts the request but doesn't determine whether to allow it or block it. With this action, AWS WAF continues processing the remaining rules in the web ACL.
 Allow – AWS WAF allows the request to be forwarded to the AWS resource for processing and response. 
 Block – AWS WAF blocks the request and the AWS resource responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.
You can override rule actions when you add them to a web ACL. When you do this, the rule runs with the action set to count. For more information about how web ACL and rule settings interact, see How AWS WAF processes a web ACL.
