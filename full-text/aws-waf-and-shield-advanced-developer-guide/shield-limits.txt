AWS Shield Advanced quotas
AWS Shield Advanced is subject to the quotas described here. These were formerly referred to as limits. 
AWS Shield Advanced offers advanced monitoring and protection for Elastic IP addresses, Amazon CloudFront distributions, Amazon RouteÂ 53 hosted zones, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers or AWS Global Accelerator accelerators. You can monitor and protect up to 1000 of each of these resource types per account. If you want to increase these quotas, contact the AWS Support Center.
