Step 3: Clean Up
To avoid extraneous charges, delete any unnecessary policies and resources. 
To delete a policy (console)


On the AWS Firewall Manager policies page, choose the radio button next to the policy name, and then choose Delete. 


In the Delete confirmation box, select Delete all policy resources, and then choose Delete again.


AWS WAF removes the policy and any associated resources, like web ACLs, that it created in your account. The changes might take a few minutes to propagate to all accounts.
