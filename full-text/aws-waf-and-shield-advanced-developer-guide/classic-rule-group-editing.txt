Adding and deleting rules from an AWS WAF Classic rule group
Note
This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet. To migrate your resources, see Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF .
For the latest version of AWS WAF, see AWS WAF. 
You can add or delete rules in an AWS WAF Classic rule group.
Deleting a rule from the rule group does not delete the rule itself. It only removes the rule from the rule group.
To add or delete rules in a rule group (console)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console using the AWS Firewall Manager administrator account that you set up in the prerequisites, and then open the Firewall Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/fms.
