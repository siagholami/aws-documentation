AWS Identity and Access Management
Note
This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet. To migrate your resources, see Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF .
For the latest version of AWS WAF, see AWS WAF. 
AWS WAF Classic integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), a service that lets your organization do the following:
 Create users and groups under your organization's AWS account
 Share your AWS account resources with users in the account
 Assign unique security credentials to each user
 Control user access to services and resources
For example, you can use IAM with AWS WAF Classic to control which users in your AWS account can create a new web ACL.
For general information about IAM, see the following documentation:
