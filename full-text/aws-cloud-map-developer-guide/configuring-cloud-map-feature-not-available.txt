AWS Cloud Map Features That Aren't Available on the Console
The following AWS Cloud Map features aren't available on the console. To use these features, you must use a programmatic method to access AWS Cloud Map:
Creating RouteÂ 53 alias records when you register service instances
When you register a service instance using the console, you can't create an alias record that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer. Note the following:
 When you create a service, you must specify WEIGHTED for RoutingPolicy. You can do this using the console. For more information, see Creating Services.
For information about creating a service using the AWS Cloud Map API, see CreateService in the AWS Cloud Map API Reference.
 When you register an instance, you must include the AWS_ALIAS_DNS__NAME attribute. For more information, see RegisterInstance in the AWS Cloud Map API Reference.
Specifying the initial health status for custom health checks
If you register an instance using a service that includes a custom health check, you can't specify the initial status for the custom health check. By default, the initial status of a custom health checks is Healthy. If you want the initial health status to be Unhealthy, register the instance programmatically and include the AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS attribute. For more information, see RegisterInstance in the AWS Cloud Map API Reference.
Getting the status of an incomplete operation
If you close a browser window after you create a namespace but before creating the namespace has completed, the console doesn't provide a way to see the current status. You can get the status by using ListOperations. For more information, see ListOperations in the AWS Cloud Map API Reference.
