Updating Instances
You can update service instances in two ways, depending on which values you want to update:
 Update any values: If you want to update any of the values that you specified for a service instance when you registered it, including custom attributes, you reregister the service instance and respecify all values. See To update a service instance.
 Update only custom attributes: If you want to update only the custom attributes for a service instance, you don't need to reregister the instance. You can update only those values. See To update only custom attributes for a service instance.
