Resilience in AWS Cloud Map
The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures. 
AWS Cloud Map is primarily a global service. However, you can use AWS Cloud Map to create RouteÂ 53 health checks that check the health of resources in specific Regions, such as Amazon EC2 instances and Elastic Load Balancing load balancers.
