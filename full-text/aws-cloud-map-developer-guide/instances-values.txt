Values That You Specify When You Register or Update Instances
When you register a service instance, you specify the following values.
Values
 Instance type
 Service instance ID
 IPv4 address
 IPv6 address
 Port
 CNAME
 Custom attributes
Instance type*
Each of the following instance types is available for selected configurations only.  
IP address
Choose this option when the resource that's associated with the service instance is accessible using an IP address.
You can choose this option for all three types of namespaces: HTTP, public DNS, and private DNS. For public and private DNS namespaces, it's available only when the service doesn't include a CNAME record.
Identifying information for another resource
Choose this option when the resource that's associated with the service instance is accessible using values other than an IP address or a domain name (CNAME). Specify the other values in Custom attributes.
You can choose this option only for HTTP namespaces. In addition, it's available only when the service that you're using to register the instance either doesn't include a health check or includes a custom health check.
Identifying information for another resource based on CNAME
Choose this option when the resource that's associated with the service instance is accessible using a domain name (CNAME).
You can choose this option only for public and private DNS namespaces and only when the service includes a CNAME* record.
Service instance ID
An identifier that you want to associate with the instance. Note the following:
 To register a new instance, you must specify a value that is unique among instances that you register by using the same service.
 If the service that is specified by Service instance ID includes settings for an SRV record, the value of Service instance ID is automatically included as part of the value for the SRV record. For more information, see Record type in the section Values That You Specify When You Create Services.
 You can update an existing instance programmatically. Call RegisterInstance, specify the value of Service instance ID and Service ID, and specify the new settings for the service instance. If AWS Cloud Map created a health check when you registered the instance originally, AWS Cloud Map deletes the old health check and creates a new one.
Note
The health check isn't deleted immediately, so it will still appear for a while if you submit an Amazon Route 53 ListHealthChecks request, for example.
IPv4 address
The IPv4 IP address, if any, where your applications can access the resource that's associated with this service instance.
IPv6 address
The IPv6 IP address, if any, where your applications can access the resource that's associated with this service instance.
Port
The port, if any, that your applications must include to access the resource that's associated with this service instance. Port is required when the service includes an SRV record or an Amazon Route 53 health check.
CNAME
The domain or subdomain name that your applications can use to access the resource that's associated with this service instance.
Custom attributes
If a resource is accessible using some method other than an IP address or a domain or subdomain name, specify one or more custom attributes that your application can use to access the resource. You can also use custom attributes for a variety of other purposes. 
You can add up to 30 custom attributes. Note the following:
 If you don't specify values for any of the following fields, you must specify at least one key-value pair for Custom attributes: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Port, or CNAME.
 You must specify both Key and Value.
 Key can be up to 255 characters long and can include the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and other printable ASCII characters between 33 and 126 (Decimal). Spaces, tabs, and other whitespace characters are not allowed.
 Value can be up to 1,024 characters long and can include the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, other printable ASCII characters between 33 and 126 (Decimal), space, and tab.
