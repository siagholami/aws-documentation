Enabling an entitlement that has been temporarily disabled
If an entitlement has been disabled, you can enable it to start streaming content to the subscriberâ€™s flow again.
Note
If the entitlement was revoked, you can't enable it. You must grant a new entitlement.
To enable an entitlement (console)


Open the MediaConnect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/.


On the Flows page, choose the name of the flow that is associated with the entitlement that you want to enable.


The details page for that flow appears.


Choose the Entitlements tab.


Choose the entitlement that you want to enable.


Choose Enable.
