Step 3c: Create users
Create IAM users for the individuals who require access to AWS Elemental MediaConnect, and add each user to the appropriate user group to ensure that they have the right level of permissions. If you have already created users, skip to step 6 to modify the permissions for the users.
To create users


In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Users, and then choose Add user.


For User name, enter the name that the user will use to sign in to AWS Elemental MediaConnect.


Select the check box next to AWS Management Console access, select Custom password, and then enter the new user's password in the box. You can optionally select Require password reset to force the user to create a password the next time the user signs in.


Choose Next: Permissions.


On the Set permissions for user page, choose Add user to group.


In the group list, choose the group with the appropriate attached policy. Remember that permissions levels are as follows:
    The MediaConnectAdmins group has permissions that allow all actions on all resources in AWS Elemental MediaConnect.
    The MediaConnectReaders group has permissions that allow read-only rights for all resources in AWS Elemental MediaConnect.


Choose Next: Review to see the list of group memberships that will be added to the new user. 


When you are ready to proceed, choose Create user.
