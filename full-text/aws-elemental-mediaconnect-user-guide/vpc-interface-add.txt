Adding a VPC interface to a flow
To avoid streaming your content over the public internet, you can add a VPC interface to your MediaConnect flow. You can add up to two VPC interfaces to each flow.
Important
Before you begin this procedure, make sure that the following steps have been completed:
In Amazon VPC, set up your VPC and associated security groups. For more information about VPCs, see the Amazon VPC User Guide. For information about configuring security groups to work with your VPC interface, see Security group considerations.
In IAM, set up MediaConnect as a trusted service.
