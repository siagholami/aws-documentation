Revoking an entitlement
After you revoke an entitlement, the content becomes unavailable to the subscriber account permanently. The entitlement and the associated output are removed from your flow. 
If you want to stop streaming content to the subscriberâ€™s flow temporarily, disable the entitlement instead. 
To revoke an entitlement (console)


Open the MediaConnect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/.


On the Flows page, choose the name of the flow that is associated with the entitlement that you want to revoke.


The details page for that flow appears.


Choose the Entitlements tab.


Choose the entitlement that you want to revoke.


Choose Revoke.


To revoke an entitlement on a flow (AWS CLI)
 In the AWS CLI, use the revoke-flow-entitlement command:
aws mediaconnect revoke-flow-entitlement --flow-arn arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-east-1:111122223333:flow:1-23aBC45dEF67hiJ8-12AbC34DE5fG:BaseballGame --entitlement-arn arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-west-2:111122223333:entitlement:1-11aa22bb11aa22bb-3333cccc4444:AnyCompany_Entitlement
The following example shows the return value:
{
      "FlowArn": "arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-east-1:111122223333:flow:1-23aBC45dEF67hiJ8-12AbC34DE5fG:BaseballGame",
      "EntitlementArn": "arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-west-2:111122223333:entitlement:1-11aa22bb11aa22bb-3333cccc4444:AnyCompany_Entitlement"
  }
