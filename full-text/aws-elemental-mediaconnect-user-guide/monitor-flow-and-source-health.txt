Monitoring flow and source health
On the AWS Elemental MediaConnect console, you can monitor the health of your flows and their sources.
Flow health indicates if your flow is not connected due to an issue with an entitlement or encryption.
Source health indicates if your source is connected. If it is, the console shows Amazon CloudWatch metrics that provide the status of the source over a period of time.
