Viewing the details of a flow
You can view a flow's details, such as ARN, Availability Zone, status, source, entitlements, and outputs.
To view the details of a flow (console)


Open the MediaConnect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/.


On the Flows page, choose the name of the flow that you want to view.


The details page for that flow appears. This page is divided into the following tabs:
    The Source tab shows details about the source for this flow, including an indication of whether the flow is connected to the source. 
    The Outputs tab shows details for each output that you created for this flow.
    The Entitlements tab shows any entitlements that you have granted on this flow.
    The Alerts tab shows a log of active alerts on this flow.
