Distributing content from an AWS Elemental MediaLive Multiplex
An AWS Elemental MediaLive multiplex creates a UDP transport stream (TS) that carries multiple programs, also known as a multi-program transport stream (MPTS). When you create a multiplex, MediaLive automatically grants an entitlement in MediaConnect for your account. Create a flow based on that entitlement and distribute the content from that flow.
To distribute content from a MediaLive multiplex (console)

In MediaLive, create a multiplex.

MediaLive creates a MediaConnect entitlement that uses the multiplex as the source. The name of the entitlement includes multiplex and the name you chose for the multiplex.


In MediaConnect, create a flow based on the new entitlement.


Add outputs to distribute the content.
