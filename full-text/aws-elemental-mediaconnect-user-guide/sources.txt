Sources in AWS Elemental MediaConnect
Each AWS Elemental MediaConnect flow has at least one source and as many as two sources. When you create a flow, you specify the source name, protocol, whitelist, and ingest port. A source can be anything that provides a live video feed, such as the following:
 An on-premises encoder
 Another AWS Elemental MediaConnect flow
 An AWS Elemental MediaLive output
 A playout system (cloud-based or on-premises)
From the MediaConnect console, you can view Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor the source health of an active flow.
