DynamoDBDataNode
A DynamoDB table that contains data for HiveActivity or EmrActivity to use.
SqlDataNode
An SQL table and database query that represent data for a pipeline activity to use.
Previously, MySqlDataNode was used. Use SqlDataNode instead.
RedshiftDataNode
An Amazon Redshift table that contains data for RedshiftCopyActivity to use.
S3DataNode
An Amazon S3 location that contains one or more files for a pipeline activity to use.
