Interpreting Pipeline Status Codes
The status levels displayed in the AWS Data Pipeline console and CLI indicate the condition of a pipeline and its components. The pipeline status is simply an overview of a pipeline; to see more information, view the status of individual pipeline components.
A pipeline has a SCHEDULED status if it is ready (the pipeline definition passed validation), currently performing work, or finished performing work. A pipeline has a PENDING status if it is not activated or not able to perform work (for example, the pipeline definition failed validation.)
A pipeline is considered inactive if its status is PENDING, INACTIVE, or FINISHED. Inactive pipelines incur a charge (for more information, see Pricing).Status Codes
ACTIVATING
The component or resource is being started, such as an EC2 instance.
CANCELED
The component was canceled by a user or AWS Data Pipeline before it could run. This can happen automatically when a failure occurs in a different component or resource that this component depends on.
CASCADE_FAILED
The component or resource was canceled as a result of a cascade failure from one of its dependencies, but the component was probably not the original source of the failure.
DEACTIVATING
The pipeline is being deactivated.
FAILED
The component or resource encountered an error and stopped working. When a component or resource fails, it can cause cancelations and failures to cascade to other components that depend on it.
FINISHED
The component completed its assigned work.
INACTIVE
The pipeline was deactivated.
PAUSED
The component was paused and is not currently performing its work.
PENDING
The pipeline is ready to be activated for the first time.
RUNNING
The resource is running and ready to receive work.
SCHEDULED
The resource is scheduled to run.
SHUTTING_DOWN
The resource is shutting down after successfully completing its work.
SKIPPED
The component skipped intervals of execution after the pipeline was activated using a time stamp that is later than the current schedule.
TIMEDOUT
The resource exceeded the terminateAfter threshold and was stopped by AWS Data Pipeline. After the resource reaches this status, AWS Data Pipeline ignores the actionOnResourceFailure, retryDelay, and retryTimeout values for that resource. This status applies only to resources.
VALIDATING
The pipeline definition is being validated by AWS Data Pipeline.
WAITING_FOR_RUNNER
The component is waiting for its worker client to retrieve a work item. The component and worker client relationship is controlled by the runsOn or workerGroup fields defined by that component.
WAITING_ON_DEPENDENCIES
The component is verifying that its default and user-configured preconditions are met before performing its work.
