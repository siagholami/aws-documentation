Install additional software on your Amazon EMR cluster
Example 
EmrCluster provides the supportedProducts field that installs third-party software on an Amazon EMR cluster, for example, it lets you install a custom distribution of Hadoop, such as MapR. It accepts a comma-separated list of arguments for the third-party software to read and act on. The following example shows how to use the supportedProducts field of EmrCluster to create a custom MapR M3 edition cluster with Karmasphere Analytics installed, and run an EmrActivity object on it.  
{
    "id": "MyEmrActivity",
    "type": "EmrActivity",
    "schedule": {"ref": "ResourcePeriod"},
    "runsOn": {"ref": "MyEmrCluster"},
    "postStepCommand": "echo Ending job >> /mnt/var/log/stepCommand.txt",    
    "preStepCommand": "echo Starting job > /mnt/var/log/stepCommand.txt",
    "step": "/home/hadoop/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming.jar,-input,s3n://elasticmapreduce/samples/wordcount/input,-output, \
     hdfs:///output32113/,-mapper,s3n://elasticmapreduce/samples/wordcount/wordSplitter.py,-reducer,aggregate"
  },
