Viewing Pipeline Logs
Pipeline-level logging is supported at pipeline creation by specifying an Amazon S3 location in either the console or with a pipelineLogUri in the default object in SDK/CLI. The directory structure for each pipeline within that URI is like the following:
pipelineId
    -componentName
        -instanceId
            -attemptId
For pipeline, df-00123456ABC7DEF8HIJK, the directory structure looks like:
df-00123456ABC7DEF8HIJK
    -ActivityId_fXNzc
        -@ActivityId_fXNzc_2014-05-01T00:00:00
            -@ActivityId_fXNzc_2014-05-01T00:00:00_Attempt=1
For ShellCommandActivity, logs for stderr and stdout associated with these activities are stored in the directory for each attempt.
For resources like, EmrCluster, where an emrLogUri is set, that value takes precedence. Otherwise, resources (including TaskRunner logs for those resources) follow the above pipeline logging structure. You may view these logs for each component in the Execution Details page for your pipeline by viewing a component's details and clicking on the link for logs:

You can also view logs for each attempt. For example, to view logs for a HadoopActivity, you can click the pipeline Attempts tab for your activity. Hadoop Logs gives the logs created by Hadoop jobs.
