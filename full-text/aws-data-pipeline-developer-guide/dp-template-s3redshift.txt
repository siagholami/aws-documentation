Load Data from Amazon S3 into Amazon Redshift
The Load data from S3 into Redshift template copies data from an Amazon S3 folder into an Amazon Redshift table. You can load the data into an existing table or provide a SQL query to create the table. 
The data is copied based on the Amazon Redshift COPY options. The Amazon Redshift table must have the same schema as the data in Amazon S3. For COPY options, see COPY in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide. 
The template uses the following pipeline objects:
 CopyActivity
 RedshiftCopyActivity
 S3DataNode
 SqlDataNode
 RedshiftDataNode
 RedshiftDatabase
