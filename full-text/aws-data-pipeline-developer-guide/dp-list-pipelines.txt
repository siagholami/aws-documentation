Viewing Your Pipelines
You can view your pipelines using the console or the command line interface (CLI).
To view your pipelines using the console


Open the AWS Data Pipeline console. If you have created any pipelines in that region, the console displays them in a list. Otherwise, you see a welcome screen.



To view information about a pipeline, click the arrow. The console displays information about the schedule, activities, and tags for the pipeline. For more information about the health status, see Interpreting Pipeline and Component Health State.
