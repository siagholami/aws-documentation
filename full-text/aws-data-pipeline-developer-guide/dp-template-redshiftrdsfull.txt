Full Copy of Amazon RDS MySQL Table to Amazon Redshift
The Full copy of Amazon RDS MySQL table to Amazon Redshift template copies the entire Amazon RDS MySQL table to an Amazon Redshift table by staging data in an Amazon S3 folder. The Amazon S3 staging folder must be in the same region as the Amazon Redshift cluster. An Amazon Redshift table is created with the same schema as the source Amazon RDS MySQL table if it does not already exist. Please provide any Amazon RDS MySQL to Amazon Redshift column data type overrides you would like to apply during Amazon Redshift table creation. 
The template uses the following pipeline objects:
 CopyActivity
 RedshiftCopyActivity
 S3DataNode
 SqlDataNode
 RedshiftDataNode
 RedshiftDatabase
