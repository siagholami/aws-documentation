S3KeyExists
Checks whether a key exists in an Amazon S3 data node.
Example
The following is an example of this object type. The precondition will trigger when the key, s3://mybucket/mykey, referenced by the s3Key parameter, exists. 
{
"id" : "InputReady",
"type" : "S3KeyExists",
"role" : "test-role",
"s3Key" : "s3://mybucket/mykey"
}
You can also use S3KeyExists as a precondition on the second pipeline that waits for the first pipeline to finish. To do so:


Write a file to Amazon S3 at the end of the first pipeline's completion.


Create an S3KeyExists precondition on the second pipeline.


Syntax




Required Fields
Description
Slot Type




role
Specifies the role to be used to execute the precondition.
String


s3Key
The Amazon S3 key.
String







Optional Fields
Description
Slot Type




attemptStatus
Most recently reported status from the remote activity.
String


attemptTimeout
Timeout before attempting to complete remote work one more time. If set, then a remote activity that does not complete within the set time after starting is attempted again.
Period


failureAndRerunMode
Describes consumer node behavior when dependencies fail or are rerun.
Enumeration


lateAfterTimeout
The elapsed time after pipeline start within which the object must start. It is triggered only when the schedule type is not set to ondemand.
Period


maximumRetries
Maximum number of attempts that are initiated on failure.
Integer


onFail
An action to run when current object fails.
Reference Object, e.g. "onFail":{"ref":"myActionId"}


onLateAction
Actions that should be triggered if an object has not yet been scheduled or still not completed.
Reference Object, e.g. "onLateAction":{"ref":"myActionId"}


onSuccess
An action to run when current object succeeds.
Reference Object, e.g. "onSuccess":{"ref":"myActionId"}


parent
Parent of the current object from which slots will be inherited.
Reference Object, e.g. "parent":{"ref":"myBaseObjectId"}


preconditionTimeout
The period from start after which precondition is marked as failed if still not satisfied.
Period


reportProgressTimeout
Timeout for remote work successive calls to reportProgress. If set, then remote activities that do not report progress for the specified period may be considered stalled and are retried.
Period


retryDelay
The timeout duration between two successive attempts.
Period
