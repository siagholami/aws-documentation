StartDocumentAnalysis
Starts the asynchronous analysis of an input document for relationships between detected items such as key-value pairs, tables, and selection elements.
StartDocumentAnalysis can analyze text in documents that are in JPEG, PNG, and PDF format. The documents are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use DocumentLocation to specify the bucket name and file name of the document. 
StartDocumentAnalysis returns a job identifier (JobId) that you use to get the results of the operation. When text analysis is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify in NotificationChannel. To get the results of the text analysis operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetDocumentAnalysis, and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartDocumentAnalysis.
For more information, see Document Text Analysis.

Request Parameters
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 ClientRequestToken  
The idempotent token that you use to identify the start request. If you use the same token with multiple StartDocumentAnalysis requests, the same JobId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from being accidentally started more than once. For more information, see Calling Amazon Textract Asynchronous Operations.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]$ 
Required: No
 DocumentLocation  
The location of the document to be processed.
Type: DocumentLocation object
Required: Yes
 FeatureTypes  
A list of the types of analysis to perform. Add TABLES to the list to return information about the tables that are detected in the input document. Add FORMS to return detected form data. To perform both types of analysis, add TABLES and FORMS to FeatureTypes. All lines and words detected in the document are included in the response (including text that isn't related to the value of FeatureTypes). 
Type: Array of strings
Valid Values:TABLES | FORMS 
Required: Yes
 JobTag  
An identifier that you specify that's included in the completion notification published to the Amazon SNS topic. For example, you can use JobTag to identify the type of document that the completion notification corresponds to (such as a tax form or a receipt).
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9_.\-:] 
Required: No
 NotificationChannel  
The Amazon SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon Textract to publish the completion status of the operation to. 
Type: NotificationChannel object
Required: No
Response Syntax
{
   "[JobId](#Textract-StartDocumentAnalysis-response-JobId)": "string"
}
Response Elements
If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.
The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.
 JobId  
The identifier for the document text detection job. Use JobId to identify the job in a subsequent call to GetDocumentAnalysis. A JobId value is only valid for 7 days.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]$ 
Errors
AccessDeniedException 
You aren't authorized to perform the action.
HTTP Status Code: 400
BadDocumentException 
Amazon Textract isn't able to read the document.
HTTP Status Code: 400
DocumentTooLargeException 
The document can't be processed because it's too large. The maximum document size for synchronous operations 5 MB. The maximum document size for asynchronous operations is 500 MB for PDF files.
HTTP Status Code: 400
IdempotentParameterMismatchException 
A ClientRequestToken input parameter was reused with an operation, but at least one of the other input parameters is different from the previous call to the operation. 
HTTP Status Code: 400
InternalServerError 
Amazon Textract experienced a service issue. Try your call again.
HTTP Status Code: 500
InvalidParameterException 
An input parameter violated a constraint. For example, in synchronous operations, an InvalidParameterException exception occurs when neither of the S3Object or Bytes values are supplied in the Document request parameter. Validate your parameter before calling the API operation again.
HTTP Status Code: 400
InvalidS3ObjectException 
Amazon Textract is unable to access the S3 object that's specified in the request.
HTTP Status Code: 400
LimitExceededException 
An Amazon Textract service limit was exceeded. For example, if you start too many asynchronous jobs concurrently, calls to start operations (StartDocumentTextDetection, for example) raise a LimitExceededException exception (HTTP status code: 400) until the number of concurrently running jobs is below the Amazon Textract service limit. 
HTTP Status Code: 400
ProvisionedThroughputExceededException 
The number of requests exceeded your throughput limit. If you want to increase this limit, contact Amazon Textract.
HTTP Status Code: 400
ThrottlingException 
Amazon Textract is temporarily unable to process the request. Try your call again.
HTTP Status Code: 500
UnsupportedDocumentException 
The format of the input document isn't supported. Documents for synchronous operations can be in PNG or JPEG format. Documents for asynchronous operations can also be in PDF format.
HTTP Status Code: 400
