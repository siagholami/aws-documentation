How Amazon Textract Works
Amazon Textract enables you to detect and analyze text in single or multipage input documents (see Input Documents). 
Amazon Textract provides operations for detecting text only and operations for analyzing text that find deeper relationships, such as form data and tables. For more information, see Detecting Text and Analyzing Text.
Amazon Textract provides synchronous operations for processing small, single-page, documents and for getting near real-time responses. For more information, see Detecting and Analyzing Text in Single-Page Documents. Amazon Textract also provides asynchronous operations that you can use to process larger, multipage documents. Asynchronous responses aren't in real time. For more information, see Detecting and Analyzing Text in Multipage Documents. 
When an Amazon Textract operation processes a document, the results are returned in an array of Block objects. A Block object contains information that's detected about items, including their location on the document and their relationship to other items on the document. For more information, see Documents and Block Objects. For examples that show how to use Block objects, see Examples.
