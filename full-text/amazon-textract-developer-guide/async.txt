Detecting and Analyzing Text in Multipage Documents
Amazon Textract can detect and analyze text in multipage documents that are in PDF format. Multipage document processing is an asynchronous operation. Asynchronous processing of documents is useful for processing large, multipage documents. For example, a PDF file with over 1,000 pages takes a while to process. Processing the PDF file asynchronously allows your application to complete other tasks while it waits for the process to complete. 
This section covers how you can use Amazon Textract to asynchronously detect and analyze text on a multipage or single-page document. Multipage documents must be in PDF format. Single-page documents processed with asynchronous operations can be in JPEG, PNG, or PDF format.
You can use Amazon Textract asynchronous operations for the following purposes:
 Text detection – You can detect lines and words on a multipage document. The asynchronous operations are StartDocumentTextDetection and GetDocumentTextDetection. For more information, see Detecting Text.
 Text analysis – You can identify relationships between detected text on a multipage document. The asynchronous operations are StartDocumentAnalysis and GetDocumentAnalysis. For more information, see Analyzing Text.
