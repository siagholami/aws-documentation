Analyzing Text
Amazon Textract analyzes documents and forms for relationships between detected text. Amazon Textract analysis operations return 3 categories of text extraction — text, forms, and tables.
Text Extraction
The raw text extracted from a document. For more information, see Lines and words of text.
Form Extraction
Form data is linked text items extracted from a document. Amazon Textract represents form data as key-value pairs. In the following example, one of the lines of text detected by Amazon Textract is Name: Jane Doe. Amazon Textract also identifies a key (Name:) and a value (Jane Doe). For more information, see Form data (Key-value pairs).
Name: Jane Doe
Address: 123 Any Street, Anytown, USA
Birth date: 12-26-1980
Key-value pairs are also used to represent check boxes or option buttons (radio buttons) that are extracted from forms.
Male: ☑
For more information, see Selection elements.
Table Extraction
Amazon Textract can extract tables, table cells, and the items within table cells.

For more information, see Tables. Selection elements can also be extracted from tables. For more information, see Selection elements.
For analyzed items, Amazon Textract returns the following in multiple Block objects:
 The lines and words of detected text
 The content of detected items
 The relationship between detected items
 The page that the item was detected on
 The location of the item on the document page
You can use synchronous or asynchronous operations to analyze text in a document. To analyze text synchronously, use the AnalyzeDocument operation, and pass a document as input. AnalyzeDocument returns the entire set of results. For more information, see Analyzing Document Text with Amazon Textract. 
To detect text asynchronously, use StartDocumentAnalysis to start processing. To get the results, call GetDocumentAnalysis. The results are returned in one or more responses from GetDocumentAnalysis. For more information and an example, see Detecting and Analyzing Text in Multipage Documents. 
To specify which type of analysis to perform, you can use the FeatureTypes list input parameter. Add TABLES to the list to return information about the tables that are detected in the input document—for example, table cells, cell text, and selection elements in cells. Add FORMS to return word relationships, such as key-value pairs and selection elements. To perform both types of analysis, add both TABLES and FORMS to FeatureTypes. 
All lines and words that are detected in the document are included in the response (including text that's not related to the value of FeatureTypes).
