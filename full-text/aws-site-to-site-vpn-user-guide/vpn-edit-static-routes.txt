Editing static routes for a Site-to-Site VPN connection
For a Site-to-Site VPN connection on a virtual private gateway that's configured for static routing, you can add, modify, or remove the static routes for your VPN configuration. 
To add, modify, or remove a static route


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Site-to-Site VPN Connections.


Choose Static Routes, Edit. 


Modify your existing static IP prefixes, or choose Remove to delete them. Choose Add Another Rule to add a new IP prefix to your configuration. When you are done, choose Save.


Note
If you have not enabled route propagation for your route table, you must manually update the routes in your route table to reflect the updated static IP prefixes in your Site-to-Site VPN connection. For more information, see (Virtual private gateway) Enable route propagation in your route table.
For a Site-to-Site VPN connection on a transit gateway, you add, modify, or remove the static routes in the transit gateway route table. For more information, see Transit gateway route tables.
