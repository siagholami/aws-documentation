Deleting a Site-to-Site VPN connection
If you no longer need an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection, you can delete it. When you delete a Site-to-Site VPN connection, we do not delete the customer gateway or virtual private gateway that was associated with the Site-to-Site VPN connection. If you no longer need the customer gateway and virtual private gateway, you can delete them.
Important
If you delete your Site-to-Site VPN connection and then create a new one, you have to download a new configuration file and reconfigure the customer gateway device.
