Exports a forecast created by the CreateForecast operation to your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. The forecast file name will match the following conventions:
__
where the  component is in Java SimpleDateFormat (yyyy-MM-ddTHH-mm-ssZ).
You must specify a DataDestination object that includes an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Set Up Permissions for Amazon Forecast.
For more information, see Forecasts.
To get a list of all your forecast export jobs, use the ListForecastExportJobs operation.
Note
The Status of the forecast export job must be ACTIVE before you can access the forecast in your Amazon S3 bucket. To get the status, use the DescribeForecastExportJob operation.

Request Parameters
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 Destination  
The location where you want to save the forecast and an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the location. The forecast must be exported to an Amazon S3 bucket.
If encryption is used, Destination must include an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key. The IAM role must allow Amazon Forecast permission to access the key.
Type: DataDestination object
Required: Yes
 ForecastArn  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the forecast that you want to export.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$ 
Required: Yes
 ForecastExportJobName  
The name for the forecast export job.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 63.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]* 
Required: Yes
 Tags  
The optional metadata that you apply to the forecast export job to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
 Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
 For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
 Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
 Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
 If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters:  - = . _ : / @.
 Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
 Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.
Type: Array of Tag objects
Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 200 items.
Required: No
