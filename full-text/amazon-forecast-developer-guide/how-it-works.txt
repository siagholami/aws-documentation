How Amazon Forecast Works
When creating forecasting projects in Amazon Forecast, you work with the following resources:
  Datasets and Dataset Groups  – Datasets are collections of your input data. Dataset groups are collections of datasets that contain complimentary information. Forecast algorithms use your dataset groups to train custom forecasting models, called predictors.
  Predictors  – Predictors are custom models trained on your data. You can train a predictor by choosing a prebuilt algorithm,or by choosing the AutoML option to have Amazon Forecast pick the best algorithm for you.
  Forecasts  – You can generate forecasts for your time-series data, query them using the QueryForecast API, or visualize them in the console.
