The ARN of the dataset group that provided the data used to train the predictor.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$ 
 ForecastArn  
The forecast ARN as specified in the request.

Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$ 
 ForecastName  
The name of the forecast.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 63.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]* 
 ForecastTypes  
The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts were generated.
Type: Array of strings
Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 20 items.
Pattern: (^0?\.\d\d?$|^mean$) 
 LastModificationTime  
Initially, the same as CreationTime (status is CREATE_PENDING). Updated when inference (creating the forecast) starts (status changed to CREATE_IN_PROGRESS), and when inference is complete (status changed to ACTIVE) or fails (status changed to CREATE_FAILED).
Type: Timestamp
 Message  
If an error occurred, an informational message about the error.
Type: String
 PredictorArn  
The ARN of the predictor used to generate the forecast.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$ 
 Status  
The status of the forecast. States include:
  ACTIVE 
  CREATE_PENDING, CREATE_IN_PROGRESS, CREATE_FAILED 
  DELETE_PENDING, DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, DELETE_FAILED 
The Status of the forecast must be ACTIVE before you can query or export the forecast.
Type: String
