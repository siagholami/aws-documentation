Amazon Forecast Identity-Based Policy Examples
By default, IAM users and roles don't have permission to create or modify Forecast resources. They also can't perform tasks using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS API. An IAM administrator must create IAM policies that grant users and roles permission to perform specific API operations on the specified resources they need. The administrator must then attach those policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions.
To learn how to create an IAM identity-based policy using these example JSON policy documents, see Creating Policies on the JSON Tab in the IAM User Guide.

Policy Best Practices
Identity-based policies are very powerful. They determine whether someone can create, access, or delete Forecast resources in your account. These actions can incur costs for your AWS account. When you create or edit identity-based policies, follow these guidelines and recommendations:
 Get Started Using AWS Managed Policies – To start using Forecast quickly, use AWS managed policies to give your employees the permissions they need. These policies are already available in your account and are maintained and updated by AWS. For more information, see Get Started Using Permissions With AWS Managed Policies in the IAM User Guide.
 Grant Least Privilege – When you create custom policies, grant only the permissions required to perform a task. Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary. Doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later. For more information, see Grant Least Privilege in the IAM User Guide.
 Enable MFA for Sensitive Operations – For extra security, require IAM users to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access sensitive resources or API operations. For more information, see Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in AWS in the IAM User Guide.
 Use Policy Conditions for Extra Security – To the extent that it's practical, define the conditions under which your identity-based policies allow access to a resource. For example, you can write conditions to specify a range of allowable IP addresses that a request must come from. You can also write conditions to allow requests only within a specified date or time range, or to require the use of SSL or MFA. For more information, see IAM JSON Policy Elements: Condition in the IAM User Guide.
Using the Forecast Console
To access the Amazon Forecast console, you must have a minimum set of permissions. These permissions must allow you to list and view details about the Forecast resources in your AWS account. If you create an identity-based policy that is more restrictive than the minimum required permissions, the console won't function as intended for entities (IAM users or roles) with that policy.
To ensure that those entities can still use the Forecast console, also attach the following AWS managed policy to the entities. For more information, see Adding Permissions to a User in the IAM User Guide:
AWSForecastFullAccess
The following policy grants full access to all Amazon Forecast actions when using the console:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "forecast:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "iam:PassedToService": "forecast.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
You don't need to allow minimum console permissions for users that are making calls only to the AWS CLI or the AWS API. Instead, allow access to only the actions that match the API operation that you're trying to perform.
Allow Users to View Their Own Permissions
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows IAM users to view the inline and managed policies that are attached to their user identity. This policy includes permissions to complete this action on the console or programmatically using the AWS CLI or AWS API.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ViewOwnUserInfo",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetUserPolicy",
                "iam:ListGroupsForUser",
                "iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies",
                "iam:ListUserPolicies",
                "iam:GetUser"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}"]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "NavigateInConsole",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetGroupPolicy",
                "iam:GetPolicyVersion",
                "iam:GetPolicy",
                "iam:ListAttachedGroupPolicies",
                "iam:ListGroupPolicies",
                "iam:ListPolicyVersions",
                "iam:ListPolicies",
                "iam:ListUsers"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
AWS Managed (Predefined) Policies for Amazon Forecast
AWS addresses many common use cases by providing standalone IAM policies that are created and administered by AWS. These AWS managed policies grant necessary permissions for common use cases so that you can avoid having to investigate which permissions are needed. For more information, see AWS Managed Policies in the IAM User Guide. 
The following AWS managed policies, which you can attach to users in your account, are specific to Amazon Forecast:
 AmazonForecastFullAccess – Grants full access to Amazon Forecast resources and all of the supported operations.
You can review these permissions policies by signing in to the IAM console and searching for them.
You can also create your own custom IAM policies to allow permissions for Amazon Forecast actions and resources. You can attach these custom policies to the IAM users or groups that require them. 
Customer Managed Policy Examples
In this section, you can find example user policies that grant permissions for various Amazon Forecast actions. These policies work when you are using the AWS SDKs or the AWS CLI. When you are using the console, see Using the Forecast Console.

 Example 1: Grant Account Administrator Permissions
 Example 2: Allow All Amazon Forecast Actions
 Example 3: Action-based Policy: Amazon Forecast Read-Only Access
Example 1: Grant Account Administrator Permissions
After you set up an account (see Sign Up for AWS), you create an administrator user to manage your account. The administrator user can create users and manage their permissions. 
To grant the administrator user all of the permissions available for your account, attach the following permissions policy to that user:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Example 2: Allow All Amazon Forecast Actions
You might choose to create a user who has permissions for all Amazon Forecast actions but not for any of your other services (think of this user as a service-specific administrator). Attach the following permissions policy to this user: 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "forecast:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "iam:PassedToService": "forecast.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
Example 3: Action-based Policy: Amazon Forecast Read-Only Access
The following policy grants permissions to Amazon Forecast actions that allow a user to list and describe resources:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "forecast:DescribeDataset",
          "forecast:DescribeDatasetGroup",
          "forecast:DescribeDatasetImportJob",
          "forecast:DescribeForecast",
          "forecast:DescribeForecastExportJob",
          "forecast:DescribePredictor",
          "forecast:ListDatasetGroups",
          "forecast:ListDatasetImportJobs",
          "forecast:ListDatasets",
          "forecast:ListDatasetExportJobs",
          "forecast:ListForecasts",
          "forecast:ListPredictors"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
}
