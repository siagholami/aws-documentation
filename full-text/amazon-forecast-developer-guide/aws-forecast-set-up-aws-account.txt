Sign Up for AWS
When you sign up for Amazon Web Services (AWS), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including Amazon Forecast. You are charged only for the services that you use.
If you already have an AWS account, skip to the next task. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one. 
To sign up for AWS


Open https://aws.amazon.com/, and then choose Create an AWS Account.


Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the account creation. Note your 12-digit AWS account number. Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad.


Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) admin user. See Creating Your First IAM User and Group in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide for instructions.
