Use the INVENTORY_PLANNING domain for forecasting demand for raw materials and determining how much inventory of a particular item to stock. It supports the following dataset types. For each dataset type, we list required and optional fields. For information on how to map the fields to columns in your training data, see Dataset Domains and Dataset Types.

Target Time Series Dataset Type
The following fields are required: 
 item_id (string)
 timestamp (timestamp)
 demand (float) – This is the target field for which Amazon Forecast generates a forecast.
The following dimension is optional and can be used to change forecasting granularity:
 location (string) – The location of the distribution center where the item is stocked. This should only be used if you have multiple stores/locations.
Ideally, only these required fields and optional dimensions should be included. Other additional time series information should be included in a related time series dataset.
