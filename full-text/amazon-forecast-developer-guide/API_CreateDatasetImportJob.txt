CreateDatasetImportJob
Imports your training data to an Amazon Forecast dataset. You provide the location of your training data in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset that you want to import the data to.
You must specify a DataSource object that includes an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the data, as Amazon Forecast makes a copy of your data and processes it in an internal AWS system. For more information, see Set Up Permissions for Amazon Forecast.
The training data must be in CSV format. The delimiter must be a comma (,).
You can specify the path to a specific CSV file, the S3 bucket, or to a folder in the S3 bucket. For the latter two cases, Amazon Forecast imports all files up to the limit of 10,000 files.
Because dataset imports are not aggregated, your most recent dataset import is the one that is used when training a predictor or generating a forecast. Make sure that your most recent dataset import contains all of the data you want to model off of, and not just the new data collected since the previous import.
To get a list of all your dataset import jobs, filtered by specified criteria, use the ListDatasetImportJobs operation.

Request Parameters
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 DatasetArn  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Forecast dataset that you want to import data to.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$ 
Required: Yes
 DatasetImportJobName  
The name for the dataset import job. We recommend including the current timestamp in the name, for example, 20190721DatasetImport. This can help you avoid getting a ResourceAlreadyExistsException exception.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 63.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]* 
Required: Yes
 DataSource  
The location of the training data to import and an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the data. The training data must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.
If encryption is used, DataSource must include an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key and the IAM role must allow Amazon Forecast permission to access the key. The KMS key and IAM role must match those specified in the EncryptionConfig parameter of the CreateDataset operation.
Type: DataSource object
Required: Yes
 Tags  
The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset import job to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
 Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
 For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
 Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
 Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
 If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters:  - = . _ : / @.
 Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
 Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.
Type: Array of Tag objects
Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 200 items.
Required: No
 TimestampFormat  
The format of timestamps in the dataset. The format that you specify depends on the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created. The following formats are supported
 "yyyy-MM-dd"
For the following data frequencies: Y, M, W, and D
 "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
For the following data frequencies: H, 30min, 15min, and 1min; and optionally, for: Y, M, W, and D
If the format isn't specified, Amazon Forecast expects the format to be "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss".
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\:\.\,\'\s]$ 
Required: No
Response Syntax
{
   "DatasetImportJobArn": "string"
}
Response Elements
If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.
The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.
 DatasetImportJobArn  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset import job.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$ 
Errors
InvalidInputException 
We can't process the request because it includes an invalid value or a value that exceeds the valid range.
HTTP Status Code: 400
LimitExceededException 
The limit on the number of resources per account has been exceeded.
HTTP Status Code: 400

There is already a resource with this name. Try again with a different name.
HTTP Status Code: 400
ResourceInUseException 
The specified resource is in use.
HTTP Status Code: 400
ResourceNotFoundException 
We can't find a resource with that Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Check the ARN and try again.
