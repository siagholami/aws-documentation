ListDatasetImportJobs
Returns a list of dataset import jobs created using the CreateDatasetImportJob operation. For each import job, this operation returns a summary of its properties, including its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can retrieve the complete set of properties by using the ARN with the DescribeDatasetImportJob operation. You can filter the list by providing an array of Filter objects.

Filter properties 
  Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT. To include the datasets that match the statement, specify IS. To exclude matching datasets, specify IS_NOT.
  Key - The name of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are DatasetArn and Status.
  Value - The value to match.
For example, to list all dataset import jobs whose status is ACTIVE, you specify the following filter:
"Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS", "Key": "Status", "Value": "ACTIVE" } ]
