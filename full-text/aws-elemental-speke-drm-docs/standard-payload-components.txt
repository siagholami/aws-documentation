Standard Payload Components
In any SPEKE request, the encryptor can request responses for one or more DRM systems. The encryptor specifies the DRM systems in <cpix:DRMSystemList> of the request payload. Each system specification includes the key and indicates the type of response to return. 
The following example shows a DRM system list with a single DRM system specification: 

The following table lists the main components of each <cpix:DRMSystem>.



Identifier
Description




systemId or schemeId
Unique identifier for the DRM system type, as registered with the DASH IF organization. For a list, see DASH-IF System IDs.


kid
The key ID. This is not the actual key, but an identifier that points to the key in a hash table.



Requests a standard unencrypted key. The key response type must be either this or the PSSH response.



Requests a Protection System Specific Header (PSSH). This type of header contains a reference to the kid, the systemID, plus custom data for the DRM vendor, as part of Common Encryption (CENC). The key response type must be either this or the UriExtXKey response.



*Example Requests for Standard Key and for PSSH *
The following example shows part of a sample request from the encryptor to the DRM key provider, with the main components highlighted. The first request is for a standard key, while the second request is for a PSSH response:
