Configuring maxSockets in Node.js
In Node.js, you can set the maximum number of connections per origin. If maxSockets is set, the low-level HTTP client queues requests and assigns them to sockets as they become available.
This lets you set an upper bound on the number of concurrent requests to a given origin at a time. Lowering this value can reduce the number of throttling or timeout errors received. However, it can also increase memory usage because requests are queued until a socket becomes available.
The following example shows how to set maxSockets for a DynamoDB client.
```
const dynamodb = require('aws-sdk/clients/dynamodb');
var https = require('https');
var agent = new https.Agent({
   maxSockets: 25
});
var dynamodbClient = new DynamoDB({
   apiVersion: '2012-08-10'
   httpOptions:{
      agent: agent
   }
});
```
When using the default of https, the SDK takes the maxSockets value from the globalAgent. If the maxSockets value is not defined or is Infinity, the SDK assumes a maxSockets value of 50.
