Alexa for Business Blueprints
Any member of an Alexa for Business organization can publish private business skills to your organization within minutes using Alexa for Business Blueprints. After a user builds a blueprint, you can review and publish the skill to use across your company with any Alexa-enabled device. There are two blueprints designed specifically for business use. The Business Q&A blueprint is a template that users can customize with their own questions and answers related to your organization. The Onboard Guide blueprint helps new employees get up to speed in their new roles with specialized how-to questions about the team and the office.
