WPA2 Enterprise Prerequisite
If you plan to use WPA2 Enterprise Wi-Fi to set up your shared devices, you will specify this network security type later in the Device Setup Tool. For more information, see Run the Device Setup Tool. However, you must create a Private Certificate Authority (PCA) in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). To do this, follow these steps:


Create a Private Certificate Authority


Get a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)


Sign Your Private CA Certificate


Import Your Private CA Certificate into ACM PCA
