Shareable Resources
AWS RAM lets you share resources that are provisioned and managed in other AWS services. AWS RAM does not let you manage resources, but it does provide the features that let you make resources available across AWS accounts.
The following sections list the services that integrate with AWS RAM, and the resources that support sharing.

 Amazon Aurora
 AWS CodeBuild
 Amazon EC2
 Amazon EC2 Image Builder
 AWS License Manager
 AWS Resource Groups
 Amazon Route 53
Amazon Aurora
You can share the following Amazon Aurora resources using AWS RAM.



Resource
Use case




DB clusters
Create and manage a DB cluster centrally, and share it with other AWS accounts. This lets multiple AWS accounts clone a shared, centrally-managed DB cluster. For more information, see  Cross-Account Aurora DB Cluster Cloning in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.



AWS CodeBuild
You can share the following AWS CodeBuild resources using AWS RAM.



Resource
Use case




Projects
Create a project and use it to run builds. Share the project with other AWS accounts or users. This lets multiple AWS accounts and users view information about a project and analyze its builds. For more information, see Working with Shared Projects in the * AWS CodeBuild User Guide*.


Report groups
Create a report group and use it to create reports when you build a project. Share the report group with other AWS accounts or users. This lets multiple AWS accounts and users view the report group and its reports, and the test case results for each report. A report can be viewed for 30 days after it is created, and then it expires and is no longer available to view. For more information, see Working with Shared Report Groups in the AWS CodeBuild User Guide.



Amazon EC2
You can share the following Amazon EC2 resources using AWS RAM.



Resource
Use case




Capacity Reservations
Create and manage Capacity Reservations centrally, and share the reserved capacity with other AWS accounts. This lets multiple AWS accounts launch their Amazon EC2 instances into centrally-managed reserved capacity. For more information, see Working with Shared Capacity Reservations in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.


Dedicated Hosts
Allocate and manage Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts centrally, and share the host's instance capacity with other AWS accounts. This lets multiple AWS accounts launch their Amazon EC2 instances onto centrally-managed Dedicated Hosts. For more information, see  Working with Shared Dedicated Hosts in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.


Subnets
Create and manage subnets centrally, and share them with other accounts or organizational units that are in the same organization from AWS Organizations. This lets multiple AWS accounts launch their application resources into centrally-managed VPCs. These resources include Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) databases, Amazon Redshift clusters, and AWS Lambda functions. For more information, see  Working with VPC Sharing in the Amazon VPC User Guide.


Traffic mirror targets
Create and manage traffic mirror targets centrally, and share them with other AWS accounts. This lets multiple AWS accounts send mirrored network traffic from traffic mirror sources in their accounts to a shared, centrally-managed traffic mirror target. For more information, see  Cross-Account Traffic Mirroring Targets in the Traffic Mirroring Guide.


Transit gateways
Create and manage transit gateways centrally, and share them with other AWS accounts. This lets multiple AWS accounts route traffic between their VPCs and on-premises networks through a shared, centrally-managed transit gateway. For more information, see Sharing a Transit Gateway in the Transit Gateways Guide.



Amazon EC2 Image Builder
You can share the following Amazon EC2 Image Builder resources using AWS RAM.



Resource
Use case




Components
Create and manage components centrally, and share them with other AWS accounts or your organization. Manage who can use predefined build and test components in their image recipes. For more information, see  Resource Sharing in EC2 Image Builder in the EC2 Image Builder User Guide.


Images
Create and manage your golden images centrally, and share them with other AWS accounts and your organization. Manage who can use images created with EC2 Image Builder across your organization.. For more information, see  Resource Sharing in EC2 Image Builder in the EC2 Image Builder User Guide.


Image recipes
Create and manage your image recipes centrally, and share them with other AWS accounts and your organization. This allows you to manage who can use predefined documents to automate repeatable image pipelines for a desired configuration. For more information, see  Resource Sharing in EC2 Image Builder in the EC2 Image Builder User Guide.



AWS License Manager
You can share the following AWS License Manager resources using AWS RAM.



Resource
Use case




License configurations
Create and manage license configurations centrally, and share them with other AWS accounts. This lets you enforce centrally-managed licensing rules that are based on the terms of your enterprise agreements across multiple AWS accounts. For more information, see Using License Configurations in the AWS License Manager User Guide.



AWS Resource Groups
You can share the following AWS Resource Groups resources using AWS RAM.



Resource
Use case




Resource groups
Create and manage a host resource group centrally, and share it with other AWS accounts. This lets multiple AWS accounts share a group of Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts created using AWS License Manager. For more information, see  Host Resource Groups in AWS License Manager in the AWS License Manager User Guide.



Amazon Route 53
You can share the following Amazon Route 53 resources using AWS RAM.



Resource
Use case




Forwarding rules
Create and manage forwarding rules centrally, and share them with other AWS accounts. This lets multiple AWS accounts forward DNS queries from their VPCs to the target IP addresses defined in shared, centrally-managed resolver rules. For more information, see  Sharing Forwarding Rules with Other AWS Accounts and Using Shared Rules in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
