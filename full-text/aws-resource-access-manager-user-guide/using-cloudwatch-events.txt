Monitoring with CloudWatch Events
Using Amazon CloudWatch Events, you can set up automatic notifications for specific events in AWS RAM. Events from AWS RAM are delivered to CloudWatch Events in near-real time. You can configure CloudWatch Events to monitor events and invoke targets in response to events that indicate changes to your resource shares. Changes to a resource share trigger events for both the owner of the resource share and the principals that were granted access to the resource share.
When you create an event pattern, the source is aws.ram.
