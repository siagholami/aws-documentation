AZ IDs for Your Resources
To ensure that resources are distributed across the Availability Zones for a Region, we independently map Availability Zones to names for each account. For example, the Availability Zone us-east-1a for your AWS account might not have the same location as us-east-1a for another AWS account. For more information, see Regions and Availability Zones in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.
To identify the location of your resources relative to your accounts, you must use the AZ ID, which is a unique and consistent identifier for an Availability Zone. For example, use1-az1 is an AZ ID for the us-east-1 Region and it is the same location in every AWS account.
To view the AZ IDs for the Availability Zones in your account


Open the AWS RAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram.


In the navigation pane, choose Resource Access Manager.


The AZ IDs for the current Region are under Your AZ ID.


Viewing AZ IDs enables you to determine the location of resources in one account relative to the resources in another account. For example, if you share a subnet in the Availability Zone with the AZ ID use-az2 with another account, this subnet is available to that account in the Availability Zone whose AZ ID is also use-az2. The AZ ID for each subnet is displayed in the Amazon VPC console.
