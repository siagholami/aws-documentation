Data Protection in DynamoDB
Amazon DynamoDB provides a highly durable storage infrastructure designed for mission-critical and primary data storage. Data is redundantly stored on multiple devices across multiple facilities in an Amazon DynamoDB Region.
DynamoDB protects user data stored at rest and also data in transit between on-premises clients and DynamoDB, and between DynamoDB and other AWS resources within the same AWS Region.
