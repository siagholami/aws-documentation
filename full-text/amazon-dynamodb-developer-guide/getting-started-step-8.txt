Step 8: (Optional) Clean Up Resources
If you no longer need the Amazon DynamoDB table that you created for the tutorial, you can delete it. This step helps ensure that you aren't charged for resources that you aren't using. You can use the DynamoDB console or the AWS CLI to delete the Music table that you created in Step 1: Create a Table.
