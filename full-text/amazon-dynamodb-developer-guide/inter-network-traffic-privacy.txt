Internetwork Traffic Privacy
Connections are protected both between Amazon DynamoDB and on-premises applications and between DynamoDB and other AWS resources within the same AWS Region.
Traffic Between Service and On-Premises Clients and Applications
You have two connectivity options between your private network and AWS: 
 An AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. For more information, see What is AWS Site-to-Site VPN? in the AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide.
 An AWS Direct Connect connection. For more information, see What is AWS Direct Connect? in the AWS Direct Connect User Guide.
Access to DynamoDB via the network is through AWS published APIs. Clients must support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2 or above. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes. Additionally, you must sign requests using an access key ID and a secret access key that are associated with an IAM principal, or you can use the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests.
Traffic Between AWS Resources in the Same Region
An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoint for DynamoDB is a logical entity within a VPC that allows connectivity only to DynamoDB. The Amazon VPC routes requests to DynamoDB and routes responses back to the VPC. For more information, see VPC Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide. For example policies that you can use to control access from VPC endpoints, see Using IAM Policies to Control Access to DynamoDB.
