UpdateTable
Important*
This section refers to API version 2011-12-05, which is deprecated and should not be used for new applications.
*For documentation on the current low-level API, see the Amazon DynamoDB API Reference.
Description
Updates the provisioned throughput for the given table. Setting the throughput for a table helps you manage performance and is part of the provisioned throughput feature of DynamoDB. For more information, see Managing Settings on DynamoDB Provisioned Capacity Tables.
The provisioned throughput values can be upgraded or downgraded based on the maximums and minimums listed in Service, Account, and Table Quotas in Amazon DynamoDB.
The table must be in the ACTIVE state for this operation to succeed. UpdateTable is an asynchronous operation; while executing the operation, the table is in the UPDATING state. While the table is in the UPDATING state, the table still has the provisioned throughput from before the call. The new provisioned throughput setting is in effect only when the table returns to the ACTIVE state after the UpdateTable operation.

Name
Description
Required




TableName
The name of the table to update.  Type: String
Yes


ProvisionedThroughput
New throughput for the specified table, consisting of values for ReadCapacityUnits and WriteCapacityUnits. See Managing Settings on DynamoDB Provisioned Capacity Tables.Type: Array
Yes


ProvisionedThroughput :ReadCapacityUnits
Sets the minimum number of consistent ReadCapacityUnits consumed per second for the specified table before DynamoDB balances the load with other operations.  Eventually consistent read operations require less effort than a consistent read operation, so a setting of 50 consistent ReadCapacityUnits per second provides 100 eventually consistent ReadCapacityUnits per second. Type: Number
Yes


ProvisionedThroughput :WriteCapacityUnits
Sets the minimum number of WriteCapacityUnits consumed per second for the specified table before DynamoDB balances the load with other operations. Type: Number
Yes

Name
Description




CreationDateTime
Date when the table was created.Type: Number


KeySchema
The primary key (simple or composite) structure for the table. A name-value pair for the HashKeyElement is required, and a name-value pair for the RangeKeyElement is optional (only required for composite primary keys). The maximum hash key size is 2048 bytes. The maximum range key size is 1024 bytes. Both limits are enforced separately (i.e. you can have a combined hash  range 2048  1024 key). For more information about primary keys, see Primary Key.Type: Map of HashKeyElement, or HashKeyElement and RangeKeyElement for a composite primary key.


ProvisionedThroughput
Current throughput settings for the specified table, including values for LastIncreaseDateTime (if applicable), LastDecreaseDateTime (if applicable), Type: Array


TableName
The name of the updated table. Type: String


TableStatus
The current state of the table (CREATING, ACTIVE, DELETING or UPDATING), which should be UPDATING. Use the DescribeTables operationto check the status of the table. Type: String



Special Errors




Error
Description




ResourceNotFoundException
The specified table was not found.


ResourceInUseException
The table is not in the ACTIVE state.
