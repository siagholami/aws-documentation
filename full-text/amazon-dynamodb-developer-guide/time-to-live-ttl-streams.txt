DynamoDB Streams and Time to Live
You can back up, or otherwise process, items that are deleted by Time to Live (TTL) by enabling Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table and processing the streams records of the expired items.
The streams record contains a user identity field Records[<index>].userIdentity.
Items that are deleted by the Time to Live process after expiration have the following fields:
 Records[<index>].userIdentity.type
"Service"
 Records[<index>].userIdentity.principalId
"dynamodb.amazonaws.com"
The following JSON shows the relevant portion of a single streams record.
```
"Records":[
    {
        ...
    "userIdentity":{
        "type":"Service",
        "principalId":"dynamodb.amazonaws.com"
    }

    ...

}

]
```
