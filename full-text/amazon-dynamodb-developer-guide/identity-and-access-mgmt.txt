IAM administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to use Amazon DynamoDB resources. You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access permissions and implement security policies for both Amazon DynamoDB and DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX).
