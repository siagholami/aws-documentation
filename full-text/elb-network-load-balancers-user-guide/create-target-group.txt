Create a target group for your Network Load Balancer
You register targets for your Network Load Balancer with a target group. By default, the load balancer sends requests to registered targets using the port and protocol that you specified for the target group. You can override this port when you register each target with the target group.
After you create a target group, you can add tags.
To route traffic to the targets in a target group, create a listener and specify the target group in the default action for the listener. For more information, see Listener rules.
You can add or remove targets from your target group at any time. For more information, see Register targets with your target group. You can also modify the health check settings for your target group. For more information, see Modify the health check settings of a target group.
