Setting up accelerated transcoding in AWS Elemental MediaConvert
You set up accelerated transcoding for your AWS Elemental MediaConvert jobs in the same way that you set up unaccelerated jobs, except that you enable acceleration.
Note
We recommend that you use a dedicated transcoding queue for your accelerated transcoding jobs, to provide isolation between the resources that you use for your accelerated jobs and your other jobs.
To set up your transcoding job with accelerated transcoding (console)

Set up your transcoding job as usual. For more information, see Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert.

Make sure that your job input files and output settings conform to the limitations and requirements listed in Job limitations for accelerated transcoding in AWS Elemental MediaConvert.


Change your timecode settings from the default value Embedded to Start at zero.


On the Create job page, in the Job pane on the left, under Job settings, choose Settings.


In the Timecode configuration pane, for Source, choose Start at 0.


On the Create job page, in the Job pane on the left, under Inputs, choose the input.


In the Video selector  pane, for Timecode source, choose Start at 0.


If you don't already have a dedicated queue for accelerated transcoding jobs, create one. For more information, see Creating an on-demand queue in AWS Elemental MediaConvert.


On the Create job page, in the Job pane on the left, in the Job Settings section, choose Settings.


For Acceleration, choose Enabled or Preferred.


With both Enabled and Preferred, if your input files and transcoding settings are compatible with accelerated transcoding, MediaConvert runs the job with accelerated transcoding. 
If your input files or transcoding settings aren't compatible with accelerated transcoding, MediaConvert handles the job differently, depending on the value that you set for Acceleration:
    Enabled – The service fails the incompatible job.
    Preferred – The service runs the job without accelerated transcoding.
 Setting **Acceleration** to **Preferred** incurs Professional tier pricing only when MediaConvert runs the job with accelerated transcoding\.

For more information about what files and settings are compatible with accelerated transcoding, see Job limitations for accelerated transcoding in AWS Elemental MediaConvert.
If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job. The setting name is AccelerationMode, under AccelerationSettings.
