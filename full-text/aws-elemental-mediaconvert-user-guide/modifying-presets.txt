Modifying custom presets in MediaConvert
You can adjust the settings and field values in your custom presets. You can't change system presets, but you can duplicate them and modify the duplicate, as described in Creating a custom preset from a system preset.
After you modify a preset, jobs that use the preset will run with the new settings, including the following:
 Jobs that directly specify the custom preset.
 Jobs that you create based on a template that uses the custom preset.
 Jobs that you duplicate from your job history that use the custom preset. The original job used the settings in the preset as they were at the time; the new job uses the current settings.
To modify a custom output preset


Open the MediaConvert console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert.
