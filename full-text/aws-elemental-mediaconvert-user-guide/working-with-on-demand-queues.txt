Working with on-demand queues in AWS Elemental MediaConvert
You can send your AWS Elemental MediaConvert transcoding job to either an on-demand or reserved queue. For high-level information about the difference between the two types, see How queues work.
With on-demand queues, you don't have to set up anything in advance. You send your jobs to an on-demand queue whenever you want. You pay per minute, billed in increments of .01 minute. Your default queue is an on-demand queue.
