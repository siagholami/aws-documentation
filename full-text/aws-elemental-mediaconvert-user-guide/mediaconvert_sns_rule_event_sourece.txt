Step 2: Specify an event source in a CloudWatch Events rule
Next, specify your event source in a CloudWatch Events rule to capture only events that are generated by a job status that changes to ERROR. 

To set up an event source in a CloudWatch Events rule


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Events, and then choose Create rule.


In the Event Source section, choose Event Pattern, and then choose the element labeled Build event pattern to match events by service. From the resulting dropdown list, choose Custom event pattern.


In the Build custom event pattern box, replace the existing code with the following code: 


{
   "source": [
   "aws.mediaconvert"
   ],
   "detail": {
   "status": [
   "ERROR"
   ]
   }
   }
This code defines a CloudWatch Events event rule that matches any event where the job status changes to ERROR. For more information about event patterns, see Events and event patterns in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
