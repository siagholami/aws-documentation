DVB-Sub
MediaConvert supports DVB-Sub  only in TS inputs.
In most cases, create one captions selector per track. In each selector, specify which track you want by providing the PID or language code.
Note
Don't specify the captions in both the PID field and the Language dropdown list. Specify one or the other. 
If you are doing DVB-sub-to-DVB-sub and you want to pass through all the captions tracks from the input to the output, create one captions selector for all tracks. In this case, keep the PID field blank and don't choose any language from the Language dropdown list.
