How to specify multiple captions tracks

If your input captions are the same format as your output captions (passthrough), you need to create only one group of captions settings. The captions selector that you choose under Captions source includes all tracks from the input.
If your input captions are in a different format, create one group of captions settings for each track. Put each group of captions settings in the same output. They will appear in the list of settings groups as Captions 1, Captions 2, and so forth. In each group of settings, choose the captions selector under Captions source that is set up for the track that you want to include.
