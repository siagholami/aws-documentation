Adjusting the output timeline with the job-wide timecode configuration
The values that you specify for the job-wide Timecode configuration settings affect the output timeline. For information about which features are affected by the output timeline, see Output timeline .
To adjust the job-wide timecode configuration (console)


On the Create job page, in the Job pane on the left, choose Settings.


In the Timecode configuration section, for Source, choose one of the following values:
    Embedded: The service uses any timecodes that are embedded in the video.
    Start at 0: The service ignores any embedded timecodes and assigns the first video frame the timecode 00:00:00:00 (HH:MM:SS:FF).
    Specified start: The service ignores any embedded timecodes and assigns the first video frame the value that you provide for Start Timecode. 
The Start Timecode field appears when you choose Specified start.


If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job. The setting name is Source, located inside Settings, TimecodeConfig.
If you don't choose a value for Source, the service defaults to Embedded.
Note
If your input video doesn't have embedded timecodes and you set Source to Embedded or leave Source unspecified, your output won't have timecodes. This means that features that require a timecode-based start time, such as sidecar captions and graphic overlays, won't appear in your output.

Set a value for Anchor Timecode.

If you use an editing platform that relies on an anchor timecode, use Anchor timecode to specify a point at which the input and output frames have the same timecode. Use the following 24-hour format with a frame number: HH:MM:SS:FF. This setting ignores frame rate conversion.
The system behavior for Anchor timecode varies depending on your setting for Source:
    If you choose Start at 0 for Source, the anchor frame is the timecode that you provide in Anchor timecode, counting from 00:00:00:00. 
 For example, if you set **Anchor timecode** to 01:00:05:00, the anchor frame is one hour and five seconds into the video\.



If you choose Embedded for Source, the anchor frame is the timecode that you provide in Anchor timecode, counting from the first embedded timecode. 
For example, if your embedded timecodes start at 01:00:00:00 and you set Anchor timecode to 01:00:05:00, the anchor frame is five seconds into the video.
    If you choose Specified start for Source, the anchor frame is the timecode that you provide in Anchor timecode, counting from the timecode that you specify for the first frame.
For example, if you specify 00:30:00:00 as your start timecode and you set Anchor timecode to 01:00:05:00, the anchor frame is thirty minutes and five seconds into the video.


If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job. The setting name is Anchor, located in Settings, TimecodeConfig.
If you don't set a value for Anchor timecode, the service doesn't use any anchor timecode.

Under Timestamp offset, provide a date. This setting applies only to outputs that support a program-date-time stamp. Use Timestamp offset to overwrite the timecode date without affecting the time and frame number. This setting has no effect unless you also include the program-date-time stamp in the output.

If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job. The setting name is TimestampOffset, located in Settings, TimecodeConfig.
To adjust the job-wide timecode configuration (API, SDK, and AWS CLI)


In your JSON job specification, set a value for Source, located inside Settings, TimecodeConfig. Choose one of the following values:
    EMBEDDED: The service uses any timecodes that are embedded in the video.
    ZEROBASED: The service ignores any embedded timecodes and assigns the first video frame the timecode 00:00:00:00 (HH:MM:SS:FF).
    SPECIFIEDSTART: The service ignores any embedded timecodes and assigns the first video frame the value that you provide for Start Timecode. 
The Start Timecode field appears when you choose Specified start.


If you don't choose a value for Source, the service defaults to Embedded.
Note
If your input video doesn't have embedded timecodes and you set Source to Embedded or leave Source unspecified, your output won't have timecodes. This means that features that require a timecode-based start time, such as sidecar captions and graphic overlays, won't appear in your output.

Optional. In your JSON job specification, set a value for Anchor, located in Settings, TimecodeConfig.

If you use an editing platform that relies on an anchor timecode, use Anchor to specify a point at which the input and output frames have the same timecode. Use the following 24-hour format with a frame number: HH:MM:SS:FF. This setting ignores frame rate conversion.
The system behavior for Anchor varies depending on your setting for Source:
    If you choose ZEROBASED for Source, the anchor frame is the timecode that you provide in Anchor, counting from 00:00:00:00. 
 For example, if you set `Anchor` to 01:00:05:00, the anchor frame is one hour and five seconds into the video\.



If you choose EMBEDDED for Source, the anchor frame is the timecode that you provide in Anchor, counting from the first embedded timecode. 
For example, if your embedded timecodes start at 01:00:00:00 and you set Anchor to 01:00:05:00, the anchor frame is five seconds into the video.
    If you choose SPECIFIEDSTART for Source, the anchor frame is the timecode that you provide in Anchor, counting from the timecode that you specify for the first frame.
For example, if you specify 00:30:00:00 as your start timecode and you set Anchor to 01:00:05:00, the anchor frame is thirty minutes and five seconds into the video.



Optional. In your JSON job specification, set a value for TimestampOffset, located in Settings, TimecodeConfig. Specify the date in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD. For example, 2008-06-26.

This setting applies only to outputs that support a program-date-time stamp. Use Timestamp offset to overwrite the timecode date without affecting the time and frame number. This setting has no effect unless you also include the program-date-time stamp in the output.
