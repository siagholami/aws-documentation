Passing through SCTE-35 markers from your input
You can include time_signal SCTE-35 markers from your input in any output that has a transport stream container. These outputs might be in an HLS package, or they might be standalone files wrapped in an MPEG2 transport stream (M2TS) container.
To pass through SCTE-35 markers from the input to an output (console)


Open the MediaConvert console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert.


Choose Create job.


Set up your input, output groups, and outputs for video and audio, as described in Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert and Structuring complex jobs in AWS Elemental MediaConvert.


Choose an output under either File group, DASH ISO, or Apple HLS. 


Under Container settings (for File group outputs), Container settings (for DASH ISO outputs), or Transport stream settings (for Apple HLS outputs), find SCTE-35 source, and then choose Passthrough.


Optional. For outputs in a File group output group, when you set Output settings, Container to MPEG-2 Transport Stream (M2TS), you can enter a value for SCTE-35 PID that is different from the default 500. 


A PID, or packet identifier, is an identifier for a set of data in an MPEG-2 transport stream container. PIDs are used by downstream systems and players to locate specific information in the container. 

Optional. For outputs in an Apple HLS output group, you can set up the job to include ad markers in the manifest. For more information, see Including SCTE-35 information in your HLS manifest.
