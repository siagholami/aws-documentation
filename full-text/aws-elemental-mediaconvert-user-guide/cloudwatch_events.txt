Using CloudWatch Events with AWS Elemental MediaConvert
You can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to monitor your AWS Elemental MediaConvert jobs. Here are some examples of what you can do with CloudWatch Events:
 Monitor the progress of your job.
STATUS_UPDATE events provide information about what phase your job is in (PROBING, TRANSCODING, and UPLOADING). For some jobs, AWS Elemental MediaConvert provides an estimate of how far your job has progressed, shown as a percentage of the total time from when your job leaves its queue to when your output files appear in your output Amazon S3 bucket.
For more information about STATUS_UPDATE events, see the table of event types in Events that AWS Elemental MediaConvert sends to CloudWatch.
For information about adjusting the frequency of status updates, see Adjusting the status update interval.
 Set up email notifications for any failed jobs.
For a tutorial on setting up this CloudWatch Events event rule, see Tutorial: Setting up email notifications for failed jobs.
This is a specific example of setting up a CloudWatch Events event rule to find out about changes to your job status. For a list of all job status change notifications that you can set up event rules for, see Events that AWS Elemental MediaConvert sends to CloudWatch.
 Get details about your job outputs.
AWS Elemental MediaConvert provides details about your job outputs in the notification for the COMPLETE event. This information includes the location and file names of the job's media files and manifests. For details, see Output file names and paths.
 Automatically initiate post-processing with an AWS Lambda function.
You can set up CloudWatch Events so that a Lambda function initiates your post-processing code after your job finishes. For more information about using AWS Lambda with AWS Elemental MediaConvert, see one of these resources:
   For experienced cloud architects, see the Video on demand on AWS post on the AWS Answers blog.
   For developers new to MediaConvert and Lambda, see the Automating MediaConvert jobs with Lambda tutorial on GitHub. This tutorial is part of the Simple VOD Workflow series of tutorials on using MediaConvert to create video on demand (VOD).
