Converting the color space
If you want your output video to use a different color space than your input video, use color space conversion. Set up color space conversion in the output Color corrector settings.
To convert the color space


Confirm that MediaConvert supports the conversion that you want to do. See Supported color space conversions.


Set up your transcoding job as usual. For more information, see Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert.


On the Create job page, in the Job pane on the left, choose your HDR output.


At the bottom of the Encoding settings section on the right, choose Preprocessors.


Choose Color corrector to display the color correction settings.


For Color space conversion, choose the color space that you want for your output.


If you are converting to HDR 10, specify values for the HDR master display information settings.


These values don't affect the pixel values that are encoded in the video stream. They are intended to help the downstream video player display content in a way that reflects the intentions of the content creator.
