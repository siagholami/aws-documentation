Listing and viewing output presets in MediaConvert
You can list the system presets that are included with MediaConvert and the custom presets that you have added in an AWS Region. You can also view the settings for an individual preset. 
To list output presets


Open the MediaConvert console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert.


If you have custom presets, on the navigation bar of the MediaConvert console, choose the region that your custom presets were created in.


The list of system presets is the same regardless of region. Custom presets appear only in the region where they are created.



Choose the three-bar icon on the left to access the left navigation pane.


Choose Output presets.


In the Output presets pane, from the Presets dropdown list, choose Custom presets or System presets.


If you are viewing system presets, you can optionally filter the list ofâ€‹ presets by category. Do so by choosing from the Category dropdown list.


To display settings for an individual preset, choose the preset name from the list of presets.
