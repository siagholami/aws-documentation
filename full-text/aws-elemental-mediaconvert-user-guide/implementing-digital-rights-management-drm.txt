Implementing digital rights management (DRM)
DRM is one of the three encryption options that you can use with AWS Elemental MediaConvert. You can use it in conjunction with the other two options. The following illustration shows the three options.

Protect your content from unauthorized use through encryption. Digital rights management (DRM) systems provide keys to AWS Elemental MediaConvert for content encryption, and licenses to supported players and other consumers for decryption.
Note
To encrypt content, you must have a DRM solution provider.

The only exception to this requirement is with the Apple HLS streaming protocol, where you can choose to either define your own static keys or use a DRM provider.
