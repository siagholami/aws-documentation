Putting timecodes in your outputs
There are two timecode-related settings that you can adjust differently for each output: Timecode insertion and Timecode burn-in.
Inserting timecode metadata
The Timecode insertion setting determines whether a given output has timecodes embedded in its metadata. MediaConvert automatically puts this information in the appropriate place, depending on the output codec. For MPEG-2 and QuickTime codecs, such as Apple ProRes, the service inserts the timecodes in the video I-frame metadata. For H.265 (HEVC) and H.264 (AVC), the service inserts the timecodes in the supplemental enhancement information (SEI) picture timing message. 
To include timecode metadata in an output (console)


On the Create job page, in the Job pane on the left, choose an output.


Under Stream settings, Timecode insertion, choose Insert to include timecode metadata. Choose Disabled to omit timecode metadata.


To include timecode metadata in an output (API, SDK, and AWS CLI)
 In your JSON job specification, set a value for TimecodeInsertion, located in Settings, OutputGroups, Outputs, VideoDescription.
Use PIC_TIMING_SEI to include timecode metadata. Use DISABLED to omit timecode metadata.
Burning in timecodes on the video frames
The Timecode burn-in setting determines whether a given output has visible timecodes inscribed into the video frames themselves. The timecodes are not an overlay, but rather a permanent part of the video frames.
To burn in timecodes in an output (console)


On the Create job page, in the Job pane on the left, choose an output.


Under Stream settings, Preprocessors, choose Timecode burn-in.


Optionally, provide values for the Prefix, Font size, and Position settings. Even if you don't provide these values, timecodes are burned into your output using these default values: 
    Prefix: no prefix
    Font size: Extra Small (10)
    Position: Top Center


For details about each of these settings, choose the Info link next to Timecode burn-in.
To burn in timecodes in an output (API, SDK, and AWS CLI)


In your JSON job specification, include the setting TimecodeBurnin. TimecodeBurnin is located in Settings, OutputGroups, Outputs, VideoDescription, VideoPreprocessors.


Optionally, provide values for the settings that are children of TimecodeBurnin. If you don't provide these values, timecodes are burned into your output using these default values: 
    Prefix: no prefix
    FontSize: 10
    Position: TOP_CENTER
