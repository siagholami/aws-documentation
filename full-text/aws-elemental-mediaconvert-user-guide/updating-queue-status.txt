Pausing and reactivating on-demand queues in AWS Elemental MediaConvert
When you pause a queue, AWS Elemental MediaConvert doesn't start processing any jobs in that queue. MediaConvert finishes processing any job that is already running when you pause it.
The following procedure explains how to pause and reactivate a queue using the console.
To pause or reactivate an on-demand queue
