Including SCTE-35 markers in AWS Elemental MediaConvert outputs
SCTE-35 markers indicate where downstream systems can insert other content (usually advertisements or local programs). You can include SCTE-35 markers in transport stream (TS), DASH, and HLS outputs.
AWS Elemental MediaConvert puts SCTE-35 markers into your outputs in one of two ways:
 The service passes markers through from your input to the output. For more information, see Passing through SCTE-35 markers from your input.
 The service inserts markers at the points that you specify in an Event Signaling and Management (ESAM) XML document. For more information, see Specifying SCTE-35 markers using ESAM XML.
Regardless of which way you put in the SCTE-35 markers, for outputs that have them, you can optionally do the following:
 You can have the service blank out audio and video during the ad avails indicated by the SCTE-35 markers. For more information, see Enabling ad avail blanking.
 For HLS outputs, you can have the service include SCTE-35 information in your output HLS manifest. For more information, see Including SCTE-35 information in your HLS manifest. MediaConvert doesn't write SCTE-35 information to DASH manifests.
Note
MediaConvert does not process information from input manifests.
By default, the service doesn't pass through SCTE-35 markers from your input. When you set up your job to pass through markers from the input or from an ESAM document, by default, the service doesn't include SCTE-35 information in HLS manifests or do ad avail blanking.
Feature Limitations
Limitations to SCTE-35 support are as follows:
 You can either specify insertion points using ESAM XML or pass through SCTE-35 messages from the input. You can't do both.
 AWS Elemental MediaConvert supports only time_signal messages, not splice_insert messages.
 The service inserts SCTE-35 messages only into the following outputs: 
   Outputs in File group output groups with MPEG-2 Transport Stream set for Container. 
Set the container for each output under **Output settings**, **Container**\.


Outputs in DASH ISO output groups.
Outputs in Apple HLS output groups.
The service forces IDR (Instantaneous Decoder Refresh) frames at the insertion points specified in your ESAM XML document only in outputs that are encoded with one of the following codecs: MPEG-2, MPEG-4 AVC (H.264), or HEVC (H.265). 

Set the codec for each output under Encoding settings, Video, Video codec.
