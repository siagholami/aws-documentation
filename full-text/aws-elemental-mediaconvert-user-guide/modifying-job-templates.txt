Modifying custom job templates in AWS Elemental MediaConvert
You can change the settings and field values in your custom job templates. You can't change system job templates, but you can modify the settings in jobs that you start from a system job template, before you create the job.
To modify a custom job template


Open the MediaConvert console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert.


On the navigation bar of the MediaConvert console, choose the region where the job template was created.


System job templates are available in all regions. Custom job templates appear only in the region where they are created.



Choose the three-bar icon on the left to access the left navigation pane.


Choose Job templates.


Choose the name of the custom job template that you want to modify.


By default, the Job templates page is filtered to show only custom templates.


On the Job template details page, choose the Update button.


On the Update job template page, adjust the settings in the template, in the same way that you would when setting up a job.


Choose the Update button at the bottom of the Update job template page.
