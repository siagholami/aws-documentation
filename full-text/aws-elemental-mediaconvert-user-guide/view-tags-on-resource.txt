Viewing tags on an AWS Elemental MediaConvert resource
The following procedure shows you how to view tags on existing queues, job templates, and output presets using the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console.
To do this using the API, see the GET method in the Tags arn endpoint section of the MediaConvert API Reference. If you send your request directly to the API, rather than using an SDK, you must URL encode the resource ARN.
