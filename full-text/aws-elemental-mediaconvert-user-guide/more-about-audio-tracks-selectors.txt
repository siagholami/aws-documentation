More about audio tracks and audio selectors
You use audio selectors to associate input audio with output audio. You can set up a single audio selector to represent one or more tracks from the input. After that, you create audio tracks in the output and associate a single audio selector with each output track.
Associations between input audio tracks, audio selectors, and output audio tracks follow these rules:
  Each input track can be associated with one or more audio selectors 
  Each audio selector has one or more input tracks 
  Each output track has one audio selector 
The following illustration shows these relationships. In the illustration, the input file contains three audio tracks. Audio selector 1 selects input track 1. Audio selector 1 is associated with output audio track 1, so track 1 of the output has the same content as track 1 of the input. The second input audio track is not selected by an audio selector, so it isn't used in the output. Audio selector 2 selects input tracks 1 and 3. Audio selector 2 is associated with output audio track 2, so output track 2 contains the channels from input tracks 1 and 3.

For workflows that require channel-level control, use the audio channel remix feature, which supports the following workflows:
 Changing the order of channels in an audio track
 Moving audio channels from one or more input tracks to different output tracks
 Combining the audio from multiple channels into a single channel
 Splitting the audio from a single channel into multiple channels
 Adjusting the loudness level of audio channels
