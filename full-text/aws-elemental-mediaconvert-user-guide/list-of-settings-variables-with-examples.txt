Description and example




Date and time
$dt$
Destination Name modifier Segment modifier
UTC date and time of the start time of the job. Format: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS Example: For a job that starts at 3:05:28 PM on June 4, 2020, $dt$ resolves to 20200604T150528.


Date
$d$
Destination Name modifier Segment modifier
UTC date of the start time of the job.  Format: YYYYMMDD Example: For a job that starts on June 4, 2020, $d$ resolves to 20200604.


Time
$t$
Destination Name modifier Segment modifier
UTC start time of the job.  Format: HHMMSS Example: For a job that starts at 3:05:28 PM, $t$ resolves to 150528.


Video bitrate
$rv$
Name modifier Segment modifier
The video bitrate of the output, in kilobits. For QVBR outputs, the service uses video max bitrate, in kilobits. Example: If you set Encoding settings, Video, Bitrate (bits/s) to 50000000, $rv$ resolves to 50000.


Audio bitrate
$ra$
Name modifier Segment modifier
Total of all the audio bitrates in the output, in kilobits. Example: If you have an output with a single audio tab and you set Encoding settings, Audio 1, Bitrate (kbit/s) to 256000, $ra$ resolves to 256000.


Container bitrate
$rc$
Name modifier Segment modifier
Combined audio and video bitrate for the output, in kilobits. Example: You have an output with a Video settings tab and Audio 1 settings tab. If you set Encoding settings, Video, Bitrate (bits/s) to 5000000 and you set Encoding settings, Audio, Bitrate (bits/s) to 96000 (96 kilobits), $rc$ resolves to 5096.


Video frame width
$w$
Name modifier Segment modifier
The frame width, or horizontal resolution, in pixels. Example: If you set Encoding settings, Video, Resolution (w x h) to 1280 x 720 , $w$ resolves to 1280.


Video frame height
$h$
Name modifier Segment modifier
The frame height, or vertical resolution, in pixels. Example: If you set Encoding settings, Video, Resolution (w x h) to 1280 x 720 , $h$ resolves to 720.


Framerate
$f$
Name modifier Segment modifier
Framerate, in frames per second, truncated to the nearest whole number.  Example: If your framerate is 59.940, $f$ resolves to 59.


Input file name
$fn$
Destination Name modifier Segment modifier
Name of the input file, without the file extension. For jobs that have multiple inputs, this is the first file specified in the job. Example: If Input 1 for your job is s3://mediaconvert-input/my-video.mov, $fn$ resolves to my-video.


Output container file extension
$ex$
Name modifier Segment modifier
Varies depending on the output group. For File group outputs, this is the extension of the output container file. For other output groups, this is the extension of the manifest. Example for file group: If you choose MPEG2-TS for Output settings, Container, $ex$ resolves to m2ts. Example for HLS group: If your output group is HLS, $ex$ resolves to m3u8.


$
$$
Name modifier Segment modifier
Escaped $. Example:  Suppose that you provide the following values:    Input file name: file1.mp4   Destination: s3://mediaconvert-input/   Name modifier: my-video$$hi-res-   Your output file name and path resolves to s3://mediaconvert-input/my-video$hi-res-file1.mp4.
