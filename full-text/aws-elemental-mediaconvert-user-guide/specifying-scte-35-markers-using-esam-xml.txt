Specifying SCTE-35 markers using ESAM XML
If your input video doesn't contain SCTE-35 markers, but you need to specify ad insertion points in your outputs, you can provide Event Signaling and Management (ESAM) XML documents in your AWS Elemental MediaConvert job settings. When you do, MediaConvert conditions your outputs  with IDR (Instantaneous Decoder Refresh) frames at the insertion points that you specify in the document. In outputs that are also wrapped in MPEG2-TS and HLS containers, MediaConvert inserts SCTE-35 time_signal messages at those points. 
For your Apple HLS output groups, you also can optionally provide an HLS manifest conditioning XML document. You can then set up your job to condition the manifests for your HLS outputs accordingly.
Note
To put SCTE-35 markers in your MPEG2-TS outputs, in addition to supplying the ESAM XML documents, you must also enable ESAM SCTE-35 on each output. For more information, see the console procedure following this overview.
About Timecodes in Your ESAM Documents
Specify the insertion points in your XML documents relative to the timing of the final output, after input clipping and stitching. Start your timing from 00:00:00:00, regardless of your timecode settings. Use the following 24-hour format with a frame number: HH:MM:SS:FF.
For example, a job has the following three inputs: a five-minute preroll, a one-hour film, and a five-minute postroll. You use input clipping to clip just the final 20 minutes of your one-hour input. So your output with preroll and postroll is 30 minutes long. If you want your first insertion point to appear three minutes into the main content, you would specify it at eight minutesâ€”three minutes after your five-minute preroll. 
To include ESAM XML documents in your job settings (console)


Open the MediaConvert console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert.


Choose Create new job.


Set up your input, output groups, and outputs for video and audio, as described in Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert and Structuring complex jobs in AWS Elemental MediaConvert.


In the Job pane on the left, in the Job settings section, choose Settings.


In the Ad signaling section, enable Event signaling and messaging (ESAM).


For Signal processing notification XML, enter your ESAM signaling XML document as text. For an example, see Example ESAM XML signal processing notification.
Note
By default, MediaConvert adds a four-second preroll to the ESAM payload. This might result in MediaConvert placing the SCTE-35 message one segment earlier than the cue marker designates in the HLS manifest. To remove the preroll, set responseSignalPreroll to zero. This setting is a child of EsamSettings.


Optionally, if you want to include information about your SCTE-35 markers in your HLS manifests, for Manifest confirm condition notification XML, enter your ESAM manifest conditional XML document as text. MediaConvert doesn't include information about your SCTE-35 markers in your DASH manifests.


To insert SCTE-35 markers in the transport stream as well as in the manifest, set the dataPassThrough attribute in your MCC document to "true". If you don't want markers in the transport stream, remove the dataPassThrough attributes.
For an example, see Example ESAM XML Manifest Confirm Condition Notification. 


For each MPEG2-TS output where you want SCTE-35 markers, enable the markers:


In the Job pane on the left, under Output groups, File group, choose the output.


Confirm that it is an MPEG2-TS output. In the Output settings section, make sure that Container is set to MPEG-2 Transport Stream.


Choose Container settings, and then scroll down to find the PID controls section.


For ESAM SCTE-35 choose Enabled.


For SCTE-35 source, keep the default None.


Do this step only for any Apple HLS output groups in your job.


If you want to condition your HLS manifest with your ESAM insertion points, follow the procedure in Including SCTE-35 information in your HLS manifest. Otherwise, follow these steps to confirm that the following settings are still in their default state:


Make sure that Manifest confirm condition notification XML, discussed in a previous step of this procedure, is empty.


For each Apple HLS output group in your job, confirm that you have kept Ad Markers unchecked.


In the Job pane on the left, under Output groups, choose Apple HLS.


In the Apple HLS group settings section, choose Advanced.


In the Ad markers section, clear the Elemental and SCTE-35 enhanced check boxes.




For each output in your Apple HLS output groups, confirm that SCTE-35 source is set to None:


In the Job pane on the left, under Output groups, Apple HLS, choose an output.


In the Output settings section, choose Transport stream settings.


For SCTE-35 source, choose None.




To include ESAM XML documents in your jobs settings (API, SDK, AWS CLI)


Include the esam property and its children at the root of the job settings in your JSON job specification. These properties are shown in the following example.


Include your ESAM signal processing XML specification as a string in the setting sccXml. 


Optionally, include a manifest confirm condition XML notification document as a string in the setting mccXml:


"esam": {
       "responseSignalPreroll": 4000,
       "signalProcessingNotification": {
         "sccXml": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<SignalProcessingNotification ..."
       },
       "manifestConfirmConditionNotification": {
         "mccXml": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n<ns2:ManifestConfirmConditionNotification ... " 
       }

For each M2TS (MPEG2 Transport Stream) output in your job, set your JSON job specification as shown in the following example. Include the property https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/apireference/jobs.html#jobs-prop-m2tssettings-scte35esam. Set https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/apireference/jobs.html#jobs-prop-m2tssettings-scte35source to NONE.

```
     "outputs": [
           {
             "extension": "m2ts",
             "containerSettings": {
               "container": "M2TS",
               "m2tsSettings": {
                 ...
             "scte35Esam": {
               "scte35EsamPid": 508
             },
             ...
             "scte35Source": "NONE"
           }

```


If you want to condition your HLS manifests with SCTE-35 information, for each Apple HLS output group in your job, include the following. These settings are shown in the example at the end of this step:
     Set https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/apireference/jobs.html#jobs-prop-m3u8settings-scte35source to PASSTHROUGH.
    Include https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/apireference/jobs.html#jobs-prop-hlsgroupsettings-admarkers and list one or both of ELEMENTAL_SCTE35 or ELEMENTAL in an array.
For sample manifests created with each setting selected, see Sample manifest: Elemental ad markers and Sample manifest: SCTE-35 enhanced ad markers.


If you don't want to condition your HLS manifests with SCTE-35 information, keep the default setting NONE for scte35Source and don't include adMarkers:
```
     "outputGroups": [
       {
         "customName": "apple_hls",
         "outputGroupSettings": {
           "type": "HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS",
           "hlsGroupSettings": {
             "adMarkers": [
               "ELEMENTAL_SCTE35"
             ],
             ...
       }
     },
     "outputs": [
       {
         "extension": "m3u8",
         "nameModifier": "high",
         "outputSettings": {
           "hlsSettings": {
             ...
           }
         },
         "containerSettings": {
           "container": "M3U8",
           "m3u8Settings": {
             ...
             "scte35Source": "PASSTHROUGH"
           }

```
