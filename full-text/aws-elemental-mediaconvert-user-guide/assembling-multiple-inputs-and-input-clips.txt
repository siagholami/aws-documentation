Assembling multiple inputs and input clips with AWS Elemental MediaConvert
You can use MediaConvert for assembly workflows. An assembly workflow is a MediaConvert job that performs basic input clipping and stitching to assemble output assets from different sources without requiring separate editing software. For example, an assembly workflow might put together a bumper followed by feature content that is interleaved with advertisements. The feature content might have a logo graphic overlay at the beginning of each feature segment.
With these kinds of jobs, you assemble your outputs from multiple inputs (using input stitching) or portions of inputs (using input clipping). MediaConvert creates all the outputs of a job from this assembly. If you want outputs with different clips of the input files or with different arrangements of the inputs, you must create a separate job for each assembly.
