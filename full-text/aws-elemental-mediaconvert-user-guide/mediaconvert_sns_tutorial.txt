Tutorial: Setting up email notifications for failed jobs
In this tutorial, you configure a CloudWatch Events event rule that captures events when a job status changes to ERROR and then notifies you about the event. To do this, you first create a topic in Amazon SNS that will send you an email notification about the failed job. Next, you create a rule in CloudWatch Events by defining an event source and referencing the Amazon SNS topic (the "target"), as shown in the following illustration.
