Setting up audio-only outputs
You set up an audio-only output in the same way that you set up an output that contains video, except that you don't include video or captions. 
For jobs with audio-only outputs in a File output group, MediaConvert generates one separate audio-only file for each output. For jobs with audio-only outputs in an HLS output group, MediaConvert creates a single rendition in the ABR stack for each output.
Note
For AAC streaming outputs, the initial segment is longer in duration than the others. This is because, with AAC, the initial segment must contain silent AAC pre-roll samples before the audible part of the segment. MediaConvert accounts for these extra samples in the timestamps, so the audio plays back correctly. 
To create an audio-only output (console)


To confirm that MediaConvert supports your input files, consult the input table in Supported codecs and containers for audio-only outputs.


Set up your job as described in Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert, but with the following differences:
    Put all of your outputs in a File output group, or put all of your outputs in an HLS output group.
    Remove the Video tab in the Encoding settings section of your output.
    Choose a supported output container and audio codec from the output table in Supported codecs and containers for audio-only outputs.
    Include only one group of audio settings per output. That is, don't choose Add audio to create an Audio 2 tab under Encoding settings.


If your outputs are in an HLS output group, choose a container for the audio-only output.


Under Output settings, in the Audio section, for Container for audio-only output, choose MPEG-2 Transport Stream to create a file in an MPEG2-TS container. Keep the default value Automatic to create a raw audio-only file with no container.

To confirm that MediaConvert supports your input files, consult the input table in Supported codecs and containers for audio-only outputs.


Set up your JSON job specification. Either manually edit your JSON file, or use the console to generate it as follows:


Follow the previous procedure for the console.


In the Job pane on the left, under Job settings, choose Show job JSON.


The JSON job specification for audio-only jobs differs from standard jobs as follows:
    Exclude each instance of VideoDescription and its children from the Outputs portion of your job JSON.
    For each output, include only one child group of audio settings under AudioDescriptions.
    For audio-only outputs in an HLS output group, specify a container for the audio-only output. Under Outputs, OutputSettings, HlsSettings include the property HlsAudioOnlyContainer. Set it to M2TS to create a file in an MPEG2-TS container. Set it to AUTOMATIC to create a raw audio-only file with no container. AUTOMATIC is the default behavior.
