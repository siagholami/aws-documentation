Working with AWS Elemental MediaConvert output presets
Output presets speed up your job setup by providing groups of recommended transcoding settings. Job templates apply to an entire transcoding job; output presets apply to a single output of a transcoding job. For more information about job templates, see Working with job templates.
You can use a system preset with settings specified for you, or you can create a custom preset with your own settings. You can create a custom preset from scratch, starting with only the default settings, or you can duplicate a system preset, adjust it to suit your workflow, and then save it as a custom preset.
