Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch
You can monitor physical AWS Direct Connect connections, and virtual interfaces, using CloudWatch. CloudWatch collects raw data from AWS Direct Connect, and processes it into readable metrics. By default, CloudWatch provides AWS Direct Connect metric data in 5-minute intervals.  
For detailed information about CloudWatch, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

AWS Direct Connect metrics and dimensions
Metrics are available for AWS Direct Connect physical connections, and virtual interfaces.
AWS Direct Connect Connection metrics
The following metrics are available from AWS Direct Connect dedicated connections. 



Metric
Description




ConnectionState
The state of the connection.1 indicates up and 0 indicates down. This metric is available for dedicated and hosted connections. Units: Boolean


ConnectionBpsEgress
The bitrate for outbound data from the AWS side of the connection. The number reported is the aggregate (average) over the specified time period (5 minutes by default, 1 minute minimum). You can change the default aggregate. This metric might be unavailable for a new connection, or when a device reboots. The metric starts when the connection is used to send or receive traffic. Units: Bits per second


ConnectionBpsIngress
The bitrate for inbound data to the AWS side of the connection. This metric might be unavailable for a new connection, or when a device reboots. The metric starts when the connection is used to send or receive traffic. Units: Bits per second


ConnectionPpsEgress
The packet rate for outbound data from the AWS side of the connection. The number reported is the aggregate (average) over the specified time period (5 minutes by default, 1 minute minimum). You can change the default aggregate. This metric might be unavailable for a new connection, or when a device reboots. The metric starts when the connection is used to send or receive traffic. Units: Packets per second


ConnectionPpsIngress
The packet rate for inbound data to the AWS side of the connection. The number reported is the aggregate (average) over the specified time period (5 minutes by default, 1 minute minimum). You can change the default aggregate. This metric might be unavailable for a new connection, or when a device reboots. The metric starts when the connection is used to send or receive traffic. Units: Packets per second


ConnectionCRCErrorCount
This count is no longer in use. Use ConnectionErrorCount instead.


ConnectionErrorCount
The total error count for all types of MAC level errors on the AWS device. The total includes cyclic redundancy check (CRC) errors.  This metric is the error count that occurred since the last reported datapoint. When there are errors on the interface, the metric reports non-zero values. To get the total count of all errors for the selected interval in CloudWatch, for example, 5 minutes, apply the"sum" statistic. For more information about getting the sum statistic, see Getting Statistics for a Metric in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.  The metric value is set to 0 when the errors on the interface stop.  This metric replaces ConnectionCRCErrorCount, which is no longer in use.  Units: Count


ConnectionLightLevelTx
Indicates the health of the fiber connection for outbound (egress) traffic from the AWS side of the connection. There are two dimensions for this metric. For more information, see AWS Direct Connect available dimensions. Units: dBm


ConnectionLightLevelRx
Indicates the health of the fiber connection for inbound (ingress) traffic to the AWS side of the connection. There are two dimensions for this metric. For more information, see AWS Direct Connect available dimensions. Units: dBm



AWS Direct Connect virtual interface metrics
The following metrics are available from AWS Direct Connect virtual interfaces. 



Metric
Description




VirtualInterfaceBpsEgress
The bitrate for outbound data from the AWS side of the virtual interface. The number reported is the aggregate (average) over the specified time period (5 minutes by default).  Units: Bits per second


VirtualInterfaceBpsIngress
The bitrate for inbound data to the AWS side of the virtual interface. The number reported is the aggregate (average) over the specified time period (5 minutes by default).  Units: Bits per second


VirtualInterfacePpsEgress
The packet rate for outbound data from the AWS side of the virtual interface. The number reported is the aggregate (average) over the specified time period (5 minutes by default).  Units: Packets per second


VirtualInterfacePpsIngress
The packet rate for inbound data to the AWS side of the virtual interface. The number reported is the aggregate (average) over the specified time period (5 minutes by default).  Units: Packets per second



AWS Direct Connect available dimensions
You can filter the AWS Direct Connect data using the following dimensions.



Dimension
Description




ConnectionId
This dimension is available on the metrics for AWS Direct Connect connection, and virtual interface. This dimension filters the data by the connection.


OpticalLaneNumber
This dimension filters the ConnectionLightLevelTx data and the ConnectionLightLevelRx data, and filters the data by the optical lane number of the AWS Direct Connect connection.


VirtualInterfaceId
This dimension is available on the metrics for AWS Direct Connect virtual interface, and filters the data by the virtual interface.



Viewing AWS Direct Connect CloudWatch metrics
AWS Direct Connect sends the following metrics about your AWS Direct Connect connections at 30-second intervals to Amazon CloudWatch. Amazon CloudWatch then aggregates these data points to 1-minute, or 5-minute intervals. You can use the following procedures to view the metrics for AWS Direct Connect connections.
To view metrics using the CloudWatch console
Metrics are grouped first by the service namespace, and then by the various dimension combinations within each namespace.


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Metrics.


For All metrics, choose the DX metric namespace.


Choose Connection Metrics, and select the metric dimension to view the metrics (for example, for the AWS Direct Connect connection).


(Optional for Connection metrics) To return data for the selected metric in 1-minute intervals, choose Graphed metrics, and select 1 Minute from the Period list.


To view metrics using the AWS Direct Connect console


Open the AWS Direct Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/.


In the navigation pane, choose Connections.


Select your connection. The Monitoring tab displays the metrics for your connection.


To view metrics using the AWS CLI
At a command prompt, use the following command.
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/DX"
Creating CloudWatch alarms to monitor AWS Direct Connect connections
You can create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an Amazon SNS message when the alarm changes state. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period that you specify. It sends a notification to an Amazon SNS topic based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. 
For example, you can create an alarm that monitors the state of an AWS Direct Connect connection. It sends a notification when the connection state is down for five consecutive 1-minute periods.
To create an alarm for the connection state


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Alarms.


Choose Create Alarm.


Choose the DX Metrics category.


Select the AWS Direct Connect connection and choose the ConnectionState metric. Choose Next.


Configure the alarm as follows, and then choose Create Alarm:
    For Alarm Threshold, enter a name and description for your alarm. For Whenever, choose < and enter 1. Enter 5 for the consecutive periods.
    For Actions, select an existing notification list or choose New list to create a new one.
    For Alarm Preview, select a period of 1 minute.


For more examples of creating alarms, see Creating Amazon CloudWatch Alarms in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
