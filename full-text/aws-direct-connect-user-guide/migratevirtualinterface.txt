Migrating a virtual interface
Use this procedure when you want to perform any of the following virtual interface migration operations:
  Migrate an existing virtual interface associated with a connection to another LAG.
  Migrate an existing virtual interface associated with an existing LAG to a new LAG.
 Migrate an existing virtual interface associated with a connection to another connection.
Note
When you migrate or associate an existing virtual interface to a new connection, the configuration parameters that are associated with the virtual interfaces are the same. You can pre-stage the configuration on the connection, and then update the BGP configuration.
Important
The virtual Interface will go down for a brief period. We recommend you perform this procedure during a maintenance window.
