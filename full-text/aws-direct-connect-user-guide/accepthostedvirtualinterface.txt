Accepting a hosted virtual interface
Before you can begin using a hosted virtual interface, you must accept the virtual interface. For a private virtual interface, you must also have an existing virtual private gateway or Direct Connect gateway. For a transit virtual interface, you must have an existing transit gateway or Direct Connect gateway.
To accept a hosted virtual interface


Open the AWS Direct Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/v2/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Virtual Interfaces.


Select the virtual interface and then choose View details.


Choose Accept.


This applies to private virtual interfaces and transit virtual interfaces.


(Transit virtual interface) In the Accept virtual interface dialog box, select a Direct Connect gateway, and then choose Accept virtual interface.
(Private virtual interface) In the Accept virtual interface dialog box, select a virtual private gateway or Direct Connect gateway, and then choose Accept virtual interface.

After you accept the hosted virtual interface, the owner of the AWS Direct Connect connection can download the router configuration file. The Download router configuration option is not available for the account that accepts the hosted virtual interface.
