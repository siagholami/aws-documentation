Disassociating a connection from a LAG
Convert a connection to standalone by disassociating it from a LAG. You can't disassociate a connection if it causes the LAG to fall below its threshold for the minimum number of operational connections.
Disassociating a connection from a LAG does not automatically disassociate any virtual interfaces.
Important
Your connection to AWS is broken off during disassociation.
