Creating a LAG
You can create a LAG by provisioning new connections, or aggregating existing connections.
You cannot create a LAG with new connections if this results in you exceeding the overall connections limit for the Region.
To create a LAG from existing connections, the connections must be on the same AWS device (terminate at the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint). They must also use the same bandwidth. You cannot migrate a connection from an existing LAG if removing the connection causes the original LAG to fall below its setting for the minimum number of operational connections.
Important
For existing connections, connectivity to AWS is interrupted during the creation of the LAG.
To create a LAG with new connections


Open the AWS Direct Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/v2/home.


In the navigation pane, choose LAGs.


Choose Create LAG.


Under Lag creation type, choose Request new connections, and provide the following information:
    LAG name: A name for the LAG.
    Location: The location for the LAG.
    Port speed: The port speed for the connections.
    Number of new connections: The number of new connections to create.
