Integrating your Game Client for Amazon GameLift
The topics in this section describe the Amazon GameLift functionality you can add to a game client or game service that handles the following tasks:
 Requests information about active game sessions from the Amazon GameLift service.
 Joins a player to an existing game session.
 Creates a new game session.
 Changes metadata about an existing game session.
Adding Amazon GameLift to your multiplayer game client is Step 5 in the Get Started with Custom Servers. The following instructions assume that you've created an AWS account, generated an Amazon GameLift-enabled game server and uploaded it to Amazon GameLift, and used Amazon GameLift tools (such as the Amazon GameLift console) to create and configure a virtual fleet to host your game sessions. When adding Amazon GameLift to your game client, you must be able to provide AWS account credentials and specify a fleet to be used with the client. 
For more information on how game clients interact with the Amazon GameLift service and game servers running on Amazon GameLift, see Amazon GameLift and Game Client/Server Interactions.
