Realtime Servers Client API (C#) Reference: Asynchronous Callbacks
Use this C# Realtime Client API reference to help you prepare your multiplayer game for use with Realtime Servers deployed on Amazon GameLift fleets. For details on the integration process, see Get Started with Realtime Servers.
 Synchronous Actions
 Asynchronous Callbacks
 Data Types
A game client needs to implement these callback methods to respond to events. The Realtime server invokes these callbacks to send game-related information to the game client. Callbacks for the same events can also be implemented with custom game logic in the Realtime server script. See Script Callbacks for Realtime Servers.
Callback methods are defined in ClientEvents.cs.
OnOpen()
Invoked when the server process accepts the game client's connection request and opens a connection.
Syntax
public void OnOpen()
Parameters
This method takes no parameters.
Return Value
This method does not return anything. 
OnClose()
Invoked when the server process terminates the connection with the game client, such as after a game session ends.
Syntax
public void OnClose()
Parameters
This method takes no parameters.
Return Value
This method does not return anything. 
OnError()
Invoked when a failure occurs for a Realtime Client API request. This callback can be customized to handle a variety of connection errors.
Syntax
private void OnError(byte[] args)

Type: DataReceivedEventArgs
Required: Yes
Return Value
This method does not return anything.
