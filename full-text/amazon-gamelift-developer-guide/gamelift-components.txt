Tools and Resources
Amazon GameLift provides a collection of tools and resources for you to use.
Core Tools
Use these tools to work with Amazon GameLift. 
Amazon GameLift SDKs
The Amazon GameLift SDKs contain the libraries needed to communicate with the Amazon GameLift service from your game clients, game servers and game services. Versions of these SDKs are available with Lumberyard or you can download the latest versions separately. See details in Amazon GameLift SDKs. 
Realtime Client SDK for Amazon GameLift 
For games using Realtime Servers, The Realtime Client SDK enables a game client to connect to a deployed Realtime server, join a game session, and keep its game state in sync with other players in the game. Download the SDK and learn more about making API calls with the Realtime Servers Client API (C#) Reference. 
AWS console for Amazon GameLift 
Use the AWS Management Console for Amazon GameLift to manage your game deployments, configure resources, and track player usage and performance metrics. The Amazon GameLift console provides a GUI alternative to managing resources programmatically with the AWS SDK.
AWS CLI for Amazon GameLift
Use this command line tool to make calls to the AWS SDK, including the Amazon GameLift API. Get the AWS Command Line Interface download and install it using these instructions. You can also view the complete AWS CLI Command Reference for all AWS services, including Amazon GameLift. 
Amazon GameLift Local
This client-side debugging tool emulates a subset of the Amazon GameLift API on your local development machine. You can test iterative code changes without needing to upload and run your game server on Amazon GameLift instances. Amazon GameLift Local can be used on Windows and Linux devices to test game clients and servers that use the Amazon GameLift SDKs. Amazon GameLift Local is available in the Server SDK download. See details in Testing Your Integration.
