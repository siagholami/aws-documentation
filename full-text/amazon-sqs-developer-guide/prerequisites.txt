Prerequisites
Before you begin, you must have the following prerequisites:
 SDK for Java
There are two ways to include the SDK for Java in your project:
   Download and install the SDK for Java.
   Use Maven to get the Amazon SQS Java Messaging Library.
Note
The SDK for Java is included as a dependency.
The SDK for Java and Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java require the J2SE Development Kit 8.0 or later.
For information about downloading the SDK for Java, see [SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/)\.


Amazon SQS Java Messaging Library 

If you don't use Maven, you must add the amazon-sqs-java-messaging-lib.jar package to the Java class path. For information about downloading the library, see Amazon SQS Java Messaging Library.
Note
The Amazon SQS Java Messaging Library includes support for Maven and the Spring Framework.
For code samples that use Maven, the Spring Framework, and the Amazon SQS Java Messaging Library, see Working Java example for using JMS with Amazon SQS Standard queues.
