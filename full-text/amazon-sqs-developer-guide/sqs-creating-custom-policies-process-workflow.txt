Amazon SQS access control process workflow
The following diagram describes the general workflow of access control with the Amazon SQS access policy language.

 You write an Amazon SQS policy for your queue.
 You upload your policy to AWS. The AWS service provides an API that you use to upload your policies. For example, you use the Amazon SQS SetQueueAttributes action to upload a policy for a particular Amazon SQS queue.
 Someone sends a request to use your Amazon SQS queue.
 Amazon SQS examines all available Amazon SQS policies and determines which ones are applicable.
 Amazon SQS evaluates the policies and determines whether the requester is allowed to use your queue.
 Based on the policy evaluation result, Amazon SQS either returns an Access denied error to the requester or continues to process the request.
