Amazon SQS message timers
Message timers let you specify an initial invisibility period for a message added to a queue. For example, if you send a message with a 45-second timer, the message isn't visible to consumers for its first 45 seconds in the queue. The default (minimum) delay for a message is 0 seconds. The maximum is 15 minutes. For information about sending messages with timers using the console, see Sending messages to a queue (console).
Note
FIFO queues don't support timers on individual messages.
To set a delay period on an entire queue, rather than on individual messages, use delay queues. A message timer setting for an individual message overrides any DelaySeconds value on an Amazon SQS delay queue.
