Working with Amazon SQS APIs
This section provides information about constructing Amazon SQS endpoints, making Query API requests using the GET and POST methods, and using batch API actions. For detailed information about Amazon SQS actions—including parameters, errors, examples, and data types—see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/.
To access Amazon SQS using a variety of programming languages, you can also use AWS SDKs which contain the following automatic functionality:
 Cryptographically signing your service requests
 Retrying requests
 Handling error responses
For command-line tool information, see the Amazon SQS sections in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sqs/index.html and the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/.
