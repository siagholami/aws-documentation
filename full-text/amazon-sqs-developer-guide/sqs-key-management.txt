Key management
Amazon SQS integrates with the AWS Key Management Service to manage customer master keys (CMKs) for server-side encryption (SSE). See Encryption at rest for SSE information and key management definitions. Amazon SQS uses CMKs to validate and secure the data keys that encrypt and decrypt the messages. The following sections provide information about working with CMKs and data keys in the Amazon SQS service.

Configuring AWS KMS permissions
Every CMK must have a key policy. Note that you cannot modify the key policy of an AWS managed CMK for Amazon SQS. The policy for this CMK includes permissions for all principals in the account (that are authorized to use Amazon SQS) to use encrypted queues. 
For a customer managed CMK, you must configure the key policy to add permissions for each queue producer and consumer. To do this, you name the producer and consumer as users in the CMK key policy. For more information about AWS KMS permissions, see AWS KMS resources and operations or  AWS KMS API permissions reference in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
Alternatively, you can specify the required permissions in an IAM policy assigned to the principals that produce and consume encrypted messages. For more information, see Using IAM Policies with AWS KMS in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
Note
While you can configure global permissions to send to and receive from Amazon SQS, AWS KMS requires explicitly naming the full ARN of CMKs in specific regions in the Resource section of an IAM policy.
Configure KMS permissions for AWS services
Several AWS services act as event sources that can send events to Amazon SQS queues. To allow these event sources to work with encrypted queues, you must create a customer managed CMK and add permissions in the key policy for the service to use the required AWS KMS API methods. Perform the following steps to configure the permissions.


Create a customer managed CMK. For more information, see Creating Keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.


To allow the AWS service event source to use the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt API methods, add the following statement to the CMK key policy.


{
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
               "Service": "service.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
               "kms:GenerateDataKey",
               "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
          }]
   }
Replace "service" in the above example with the Service name of the event source. Event sources include the following services.  
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


configure an existing SSE queue using the ARN of your CMK.


Provide the ARN of the encrypted queue to the event source.


Configure KMS permissions for producers
When the data key reuse period expires, the producer's next call to SendMessage or SendMessageBatch also triggers calls to kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt. The call to kms:Decrypt is to verify the integrity of the new data key before using it. Therefore, the producer must have the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions for the customer master key (CMK). 
Add the following statement to the IAM policy of the producer. Remember to use the correct ARN values for the key resource and the queue resource.
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
            "kms:GenerateDataKey",
            "kms:Decrypt"
         ],
         "Resource":  "arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
         }, {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
            "sqs:SendMessage" 
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:123456789012:MyQueue"
      }]
}
Configure KMS permissions for consumers
When the data key reuse period expires, the consumer's next call to ReceiveMesssage also triggers a call to kms:Decrypt, to verify the integrity of the new data key before using it. Therefore, the consumer must have the kms:Decrypt permission for any customer master key (CMK) that is used to encrypt the messages in the specified queue. If the queue acts as a dead-letter queue, the consumer must also have the kms:Decrypt permission for any CMK that is used to encrypt the messages in the source queue. Add the following statement to the IAM policy of the consumer. Remember to use the correct ARN values for the key resource and the queue resource.
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
            "kms:Decrypt"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
         }, {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
            "sqs:ReceiveMessage"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:123456789012:MyQueue"
      }]
}
Understanding the data key reuse period
The  data key reuse period defines the maximum duration for Amazon SQS to reuse the same data key. When the data key reuse period ends, Amazon SQS generates a new data key. Note the following guidelines about the reuse period.
 A shorter reuse period provides better security but results in more calls to AWS KMS, which might incur charges beyond the Free Tier.
 Although the data key is cached separately for encryption and for decryption, the reuse period applies to both copies of the data key.
 When the data key reuse period ends, the next call to SendMessage or SendMessageBatch typically triggers a call to the AWS KMS GenerateDataKey method to get a new data key. Also, the next calls to SendMessage and ReceiveMessage will each trigger a call to AWS KMS Decrypt to verify the integrity of the data key before using it.
 Principals (AWS accounts or IAM users) don't share data keys (messages sent by unique principals always get unique data keys). Thus, the volume of calls to AWS KMS is a multiple of the number of unique principals in use during the data key reuse period:
Estimating AWS KMS costs
To predict costs and better understand your AWS bill, you might want to know how often Amazon SQS uses your customer master key (CMK).
Note
Although the following formula can give you a very good idea of expected costs, actual costs might be higher because of the distributed nature of Amazon SQS.
To calculate the number of API requests (R) per queue, use the following formula:
R = B / D * (2 * P  C)
B is the billing period (in seconds).
D is the data key reuse period (in seconds).
P is the number of producing principals that send to the Amazon SQS queue.
C is the number of consuming principals that receive from the Amazon SQS queue.
Important
In general, producing principals incur double the cost of consuming principals. For more information, see Understanding the data key reuse period.
If the producer and consumer have different IAM users, the cost increases.
The following are example calculations. For exact pricing information, see AWS Key Management Service Pricing.
Example 1: Calculating the number of AWS KMS API calls for 2 principals and 1 queue
This example assumes the following:
 The billing period is January 1-31 (2,678,400 seconds).
 The data key reuse period is set to 5 minutes (300 seconds).
 There is 1 queue.
 There is 1 producing principal and 1 consuming principal.
2,678,400 / 300 * (2 * 1  1) = 26,784
Example 2: Calculating the number of AWS KMS API calls for multiple producers and consumers and 2 queues
This example assumes the following:
 The billing period is February 1-28 (2,419,200 seconds).
 The data key reuse period is set to 24 hours (86,400 seconds).
 There are 2 queues.
 The first queue has 3 producing principals and 1 consuming principal.
 The second queue has 5 producing principals and 2 consuming principals.
(2,419,200 / 86,400 * (2 * 3  1))  (2,419,200 / 86,400 * (2 * 5  2)) = 532
