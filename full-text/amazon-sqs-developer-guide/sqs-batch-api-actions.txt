Amazon SQS batch actions
To reduce costs or manipulate up to 10 messages with a single action, you can use the following actions:
 [SendMessageBatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessageBatch.html)
 [DeleteMessageBatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMessageBatch.html)
 [ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch.html)
You can take advantage of batch functionality using the Query API, or an AWS SDK that supports the Amazon SQS batch actions.
Note
The total size of all messages that you send in a single SendMessageBatch call can't exceed 262,144 bytes (256 KB).
You can't set permissions for SendMessageBatch, DeleteMessageBatch, or ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch explicitly. Setting permissions for SendMessage, DeleteMessage, or ChangeMessageVisibility sets permissions for the corresponding batch versions of the actions.
The Amazon SQS console doesn't support batch actions.
