Basic examples of Amazon SQS policies
This section shows example policies for common Amazon SQS use cases.
You can use the console to verify the effects of each policy as you attach the policy to the user. Initially, the user doesn't have permissions and won't be able to do anything in the console. As you attach policies to the user, you can verify that the user can perform various actions in the console.
Note
We recommend that you use two browser windows: one to grant permissions and the other to sign into the AWS Management Console using the user's credentials to verify permissions as you grant them to the user.
Example 1: Grant one permission to one AWS account
The following example policy grants AWS account number 111122223333 the SendMessage permission for the queue named 444455556666/queue1 in the US East (Ohio) region.
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Id": "Queue1_Policy_UUID",
   "Statement": [{
      "Sid":"Queue1_SendMessage",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
         "AWS": [ 
            "111122223333"
         ]
      },
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:444455556666:queue1"
   }]  
}
Example 2: Grant two permissions to one AWS account
The following example policy grants AWS account number 111122223333 both the SendMessage and ReceiveMessage permission for the queue named 444455556666/queue1.
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Id": "Queue1_Policy_UUID",
   "Statement": [{
      "Sid":"Queue1_Send_Receive",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
         "AWS": [
            "111122223333"
         ]
      },
      "Action": [
         "sqs:SendMessage",
         "sqs:ReceiveMessage"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:444455556666:queue1"
   }]
}
Example 3: Grant all permissions to two AWS accounts
The following example policy grants two different AWS accounts numbers (111122223333 and 444455556666) permission to use all actions to which Amazon SQS allows shared access for the queue named 123456789012/queue1 in the US East (Ohio) region.

            "444455556666"
         ]
      },
