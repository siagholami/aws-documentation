Contact block: Set disconnect flow
Contact flow types
You can use this block in the following contact flow types:
 All flows
Description

Specifies which contact flow to run after a disconnect event during a conversation. A disconnect event is when an agent disconnects. When the disconnect event occurs, the corresponding content flow runs. 
Here are examples of when you might use this block:

Run post-call surveys. For example, the agent asks the customer to remain on the line for a post-call survey. The agent hangs up and a disconnect flow is run. In the disconnect flow, the customer is asked a set of questions using the Get customer input block. Their answers are uploaded using an Invoke AWS Lambda function block to an external customer feedback database. The customer is thanked and disconnected.
For more information about creating post-call surveys, see this blog post by an AWS Solution Architect: Create post call surveys in Amazon Connect.
   In a chat scenario, if a customer stops responding to the chat, use this block to decide whether to run the disconnect flow and call a Wait block, or end the conversation.
