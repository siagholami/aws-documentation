Part 1: Create an Amazon Lex bot
This step assumes it's the first time you've opened the Amazon Lex console. If you've created a Amazon Lex bot before, your steps differ slightly from the ones in this section.


Choose the following link to open the Amazon Lex console, or enter the URL in your web browser: https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/.


If this is the first time you've created Amazon Lex bot, choose Get Started. Otherwise, you are already in the Amazon Lex dashboard.



Choose Custom bot.



Enter the following information:
    Bot name — For this tutorial, name the bot HelpDesk.
    Output voice— Select the voice for your bot to use when speaking to callers. The default voice for Amazon Connect is Joanna.
    Session timeout— Choose how long the bot should wait to get input from a caller before ending the session.
    COPPA— Choose whether the bot is subject to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.


The completed page looks like the following image. 


Choose Create.
