DequeueContactAndTransferToQueue
This action is a combination of a "Dequeue" action and a "TransferContactToQueue" action. This means that a contact in a queue is removed from the queue, a new contact segment is created with the existing contact as its previous contact, and the new contact is placed into the specified queue (referred to as "Queue-to-queue transfer"). If this contact has not been queued, is actively being joined to an agent, or has been routed to an agent, this action fails.
