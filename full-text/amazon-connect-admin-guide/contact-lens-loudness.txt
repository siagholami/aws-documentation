About loudness scores in Contact Lens
A loudness score measures how loudly someone is speaking. Contact Lens displays an analysis of the conversation that lets you identify where the customer or agent may be talking loudly and have a negative sentiment. Then you can investigate further by reading that portion of the transcript or listening to that section of the call. 
For example, the following image shows where the customer is talking loudly and their sentiment is negative.
