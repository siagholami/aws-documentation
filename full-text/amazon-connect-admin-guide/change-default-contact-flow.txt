Change a default contact flow
You can override the way the default flows work by editing them directly. 
Generally we recommend creating new flows based on the defaults, rather than editing the default flow directly. You can make a copy of the default flow, assign a name that indicates it's a custom version, and then edit that one. This gives you more control over how your contact flows work.
Change how a default contact flow works
The following steps show how to change the default message customers hear when they are put in a queue to wait for the next available agent.


On the navigation menu, choose Routing, Contact flows.


Choose the default contact flow you want to customize. For example, choose Default customer queue if you want to create your own message when a customer put in queue instead of using one we've provided.



To customize the message, choose the Loop prompts block to open the properties page. 



Use the dropdown box to either choose different music, or set to Text to Speech and then type a message to be played, as shown in the following image. 



Choose Save at the bottom of the properties page. 


Choose Publish. Amazon Connect starts playing the new message almost immediately (it may take a few moments for it to fully take effect).



Copy a default contact flow before customizing it
Use the following steps to create a new flow based a current default.


On the navigation menu, choose Routing, Contact flows.


Choose the default contact flow you want to customize. 


In the upper right corner of the page, choose the Save drop-down arrow. Choose Save as.



Assign a new name for the contact flow, for example, Customer hold message.



Add the new contact flow (in this case, Customer hold message) to the contact flows you create so it's run instead of the default.
