Security profiles
A security profile is a group of permissions that map to a common role in a contact center. For example, the Agent security profile contains permissions needed to access the Contact Control Panel (CCP).
Security profiles help you manage who can access the Amazon Connect dashboard and Contact Control Panel (CCP), and who can perform specific tasks.
