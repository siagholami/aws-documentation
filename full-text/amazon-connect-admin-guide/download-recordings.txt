Download recordings/transcripts of past conversations
These are the steps that a manager does to download past recordings/transcripts of conversations.


Log in to Amazon Connect with a user account that has permissions to access recordings.


In Amazon Connect choose Metrics and quality, Contact search. 


Filter the list of contacts by date, agent login, phone number, or other criteria. Choose Search.


Conversations that were recorded have icons in the Recording/Transcript column. If you don't have the appropriate permissions, you won't see these icons.



Choose the Download icon. 



The recording is saved automatically to your Downloads folder as a .wav file. 



The name of the file is the contact ID.
