How Initial delay affects Scheduled and In queue metrics
In the Transfer to queue block, the Initial delay property affects when a callback is put in queue. For example, assume Initial delay is set to 30 seconds. Here's what appears in your real-time metrics report:


After 20 seconds, the callback has already been created, but it is not yet in queue because of the Initial delay setting.



After 35 seconds, the callback contact has been placed in queue.



Assume that after 40 seconds, an agent accepts the callback.
