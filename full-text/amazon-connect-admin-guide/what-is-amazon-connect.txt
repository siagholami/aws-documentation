What is Amazon Connect?
Amazon Connect is an omnichannel cloud contact center. You can set up a contact center in a few steps, add agents who are located anywhere, and start engaging with your customers.
You can create personalized experiences for your customers using omnichannel communications. For example, you can dynamically offer chat and voice contact, based on such factors as customer preference and estimated wait times. Agents, meanwhile, conveniently handle all customers from just one interface. 
Amazon Connect is an open platform that you can integrate with other enterprise applications, such as Salesforce. In addition, you can take advantage of the AWS ecosystem to innovate new experiences for your customers.
