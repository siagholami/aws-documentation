Can't hear indicator for incoming chat?
If an agent can't hear the audio indicator for an incoming chat, the problem is likely because Google added an audio policy flag to Chrome. This flag exists in Chrome versions 71 - 75. 
To fix this, add the CCP web site to the allow list in the agent's Chrome settings. For instructions, see this Google Chrome Help article.
For more information about solving audio problems, see Troubleshooting Issues with the Contact Control Panel (CCP).
