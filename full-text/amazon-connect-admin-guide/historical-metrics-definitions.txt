Historical metrics definitions
The following metrics are available to include in historical metrics reports in Amazon Connect.
Tip
Developers can use the GetMetricData  API to get a subset of the following historical metrics from the specified Amazon Connect instance.
After contact work time
The total time that an agent spent doing ACW for a contact. 
You specify the amount of time an agent has to do ACW in their  agent configuration settings. When a conversation with a contact ends, the agent is automatically allocated to do ACW for the contact. They stop doing ACW for a contact when they indicate they are ready for another contact in the CCP.
 Type: String (hh:mm:ss)
 Category: CTR-driven metric
Agent answer rate
Percentage of contacts routed to an agent that were answered.
 Type: String 
 Min value: 0.00%
 Max value: 100.00%
 Category: Agent activity-driven metric
Agent first name
The first name of the agent, as entered in their Amazon Connect user account. This metric is available only when grouping by agent.
 Type: String 
 Length: 1-255
Agent idle time
After the agent sets their status in the CCP to Available, this is the amount of time they weren't handling contacts  any time their contacts were in an Error state. 
Agent idle time doesn’t include the amount of time from when Amazon Connect starts routing the contact to the agent, to when agent picks up or declines the contact.
 Type: String (hh:mm:ss)
 Category: Agent activity-driven metric
Agent interaction and hold time
Sum of Agent interaction time and Customer hold time.
 Type: String (hh:mm:ss)
 Category: CTR-driven metric
Agent interaction time
Total time that agents spent interacting with customers on a contact. This does not include Customer Hold Time or After Contact Work Time.
 Type: String (hh:mm:ss)
 Category: CTR-driven metric
Agent last name
The last name of the agent, as entered in their Amazon Connect user account. This metric is available only when grouping by agent.
 Type: String 
 Length: 1-255
Agent name
The name of the agent, displayed as follows: Agent last name, Agent first name. This metric is available only when grouping by agent.
Agent non-response
Count of contacts routed to an agent but not answered by that agent, including contacts abandoned by the customer. 
If a contact is not answered by a given agent, we attempt to route it to another agent to handle; the contact is not dropped. Because a single contact can be missed multiple times (including by the same agent), it can be counted multiple times: once for each time it is routed to an agent but not answered.
This metric appears as Contacts missed in scheduled reports and exported CSV files.
 Type: Integer 
 Category: Agent activity-driven metric
Agent on contact time
Total time that an agent spent on a contact, including Customer Hold Time and After Contact Work Time. This does not include time spent on a contact while in a custom status.
Tip
If you want to include the time spent in a custom status, see Contact handle time.
 Type: String (hh:mm:ss)
 Category: Agent activity-driven metric
API contacts

 Type: String (hh:mm:ss)
 Category: CTR-driven metric
Average agent interaction and customer hold time
Average of the sum of the agent interaction and customer hold time. This is calculated by averaging the sum of the following values from the CTR: AgentInteractionDuration and CustomerHoldDuration.

 Category: CTR-driven metric
Average handle time
The average time, from start to finish, that a contact was connected with an agent (average handled time). It includes talk time, hold time, and After Contact Work (ACW) time.
AHT is calculated by averaging the amount of time between the contact being answered by an agent and the conversation ending.
 Type: String (hh:mm:ss)

Contacts consulted
Deprecated May 2019. When used in a report, it returns a dash (-). 
Count of contacts handled by an agent who consulted with another agent in Amazon Connect. The agent interacts with the other agent, but the customer is not transferred to the other agent.
 Type: Integer 
 Category: CTR-driven metric
Contacts handled
Count of contacts that were connected to an agent.
It doesn’t matter how the contact got to the agent. It could be a customer calling your contact center, or an agent calling the customer. It could be a contact transferred from one agent to another. It could be a contact where the agent answered it, but then they weren’t sure what to do and they transferred the contact away again. As long as the agent was connected to the contact, it increments Contacts handled. 
 Type: Integer 
 Category: CTR-driven metric

Count of incoming contacts that were handled by an agent, including inbound contacts and transferred contacts.
 Type: Integer 
 Category: CTR-driven metric

Count of contacts routed to an agent but not answered by the agent, including contacts abandoned by the customer. A contact can be counted as missed multiple times, once for each time it is routed to an agent but not answered.
When you add this to a historical metrics report, it appears under the column named Agent non-response.
 Type: Integer 
 Category: Agent activity-driven metric

 Category: CTR-driven metric
Customer hold time
Total time that customers spent on hold after being connected to an agent. This includes time spent on a hold when being transferred, but does not include time spent in a queue.
 Type: String (hh:mm:ss)
 Category: CTR-driven metric
Error status time
For a specific agent, the total time contacts were in an error status. This metric can't be grouped or filtered by queue.
 Type: String (hh:mm:ss)
 Category: Agent activity-driven metric
Maximum queued time
The longest time that a contact spent waiting in the queue. This includes all contacts added to the queue, even if they were not connected with an agent, such as abandoned contacts.
 Type: String (hh:mm:ss)
 Category: CTR-driven metric
Non-Productive Time
Total time that agents spent in a custom status. That is, their CCP status is other than Available or Offline. 
This metric doesn't mean that the agent was spending their time unproductively. 
Tip
Agents can handle contacts while their CCP status is set to a custom status. For example, agents can be On contact or doing ACW while their CCP is set to a custom status. This means it's possible for agents to be counted as On contact and NPT at the same time. 
This metric can't be grouped or filtered by queue.
 Type: String (hh:mm:ss)
 Category: Agent activity-driven metric
Occupancy
Percentage of time that agents were active on contacts. This percentage is calculated as follows:
(Agent on contact (wall clock time) / (Agent on contact (wall clock time)  Agent idle time)) 
Important
Occupancy doesn't account for concurrency. That is, an agent is considered 100% occupied for a given interval if they are handling at least one contact for that entire duration. 
 Type: String
 Min value: 0.00%
 Max value: 100.00%
 Category: Agent activity-driven metric
Online time
Total time that an agent spent with their CCP set to a status other than Offline. This includes any time spent in a custom status. This metric can't be grouped or filtered by queue.
 Type: String
 Category: Agent activity-driven metric
Service level X seconds
Percentage of contacts removed from the queue between 0 and X seconds after being added to it. A contact is removed from a queue when the following occurs: an agent answers the contact, the customer abandons the contact, or the customer requests a call back. The possible values for X are: 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 600. This percentage is calculated as follows:
(Contacts removed from queue in X seconds / Contacts queued) * 100
 Type: String
 Min value: 0.00%
 Max value: 100.00%
 Category: CTR-driven metric
