Real-time metrics reports
Real-time metrics reports show real-time or near-real time metrics information about activity in your contact center. Metrics such as Online show the number of agents currently online in real-time, updating every 15 seconds. Metrics such as Handled and Abandoned reflect near real-time values for your contact center.
You can customize the reports, specify a time range for each report, select metrics for each report, and select filters for data to include or exclude from each report.
