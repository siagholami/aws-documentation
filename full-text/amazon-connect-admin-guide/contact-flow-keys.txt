Encrypt Customer Input
You can encrypt sensitive data that is collected by contact flows. To do this, you need to use public-key cryptography. Here's how this works: 
In a contact flow that collects data, you provide an X.509 certificate to encrypt data that's captured using the Stored customer input system attribute. You must upload a signing key in .pem format to use this feature. The signing key is used to verify the signature of the certificate used within the contact flow. 
Note
You can have up to two signing keys active at one time to facilitate rotation.
To decrypt the data in the Stored customer input attribute, use the AWS Encryption SDK. For more information, see the AWS Encryption SDK Developer Guide.
For a detailed walkthrough, see Creating a secure IVR solution with Amazon Connect. It shows how to:
 Configure Amazon Connect to collect a credit card number.
 Encrypt the credit card digits.
 Send it to our backend AWS Lambda for decryption, using the customer supplied decryption key.
