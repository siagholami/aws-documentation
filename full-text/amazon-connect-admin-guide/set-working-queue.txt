A queue must be specified before invoking Transfer to queue except when used in a customer queue flow. Itâ€™s also the default queue for checking attributes, such as staffing, queue status, and hours of operation.

Properties

 By queue > Use attribute. To set the queue dynamically, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the queue rather than the queue name. To find the ARN for a queue, open the queue in the queue editor. The ARN is included as the last part of the URL displayed in the browser address bar after /queue.
