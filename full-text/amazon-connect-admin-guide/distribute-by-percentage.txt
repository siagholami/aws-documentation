Contact block: Distribute by percentage
Contact flow types

 Inbound contact flow
 Customer queue flow
 Outbound Whisper flow

Description

This block is useful for doing A/B testing. It routes customers randomly based on a percentage.
Like flipping a coin, contacts are distributed randomly, which doesnâ€™t guarantee exact percentage splits.

Properties

How it works
This block creates static allocation rules based on how you configure it. Internal logic generates a random number between 1-100. This number identifies which branch to take. It doesn't use current or historical volume as part of it's logic.
For example, say a block is configure like this:
 20% = A
 40% = B
 40% remaining = Default
When contact a is being routed through a flow, Amazon Connect generates the random number. 
 If number is between 0-20, the contact is routed down the A branch.
 Between 21-60 it's routed down the B branch.
 Greater than 60 it's routed down the Default branch.
Configured block
When this block is configured, it looks similar to the following image:
