Use Service-Linked Roles for Amazon Connect
Amazon Connect uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Amazon Connect. Service-linked roles are predefined by Amazon Connect and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.
A service-linked role makes setting up Amazon Connect easier because you don't have to manually add the necessary permissions. Amazon Connect defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only Amazon Connect can assume its roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.
For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS Services That Work with IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column. Choose a Yes with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.

You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-Linked Role Permissions in the IAM User Guide.
