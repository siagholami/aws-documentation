Sample queue customer
Type: Contact flow (inbound)
This contact flow performs checks before placing customer into a queue. Here's how it works:


The Set working queue block determines which queue to transfer the customer to.


The Check hours of operation block perform checks to avoid the customer being queued during non-working hours.


The customer is transferred to the queue if it is within business hours, and the queue can handle this call. Otherwise, the customer is played a message "We are not able to take your call right now. Goodbye." And then the customer is disconnected.
