Login/Logout Reports
The Login/Logout report displays the login and logout information for the agents in your contact center. For each agent session, the login and logout times are displayed as a row in the report. You can use the report to determine the time your agents were logged in to Amazon Connect. The report also displays the amount of time for each session that an agent was logged in to Amazon Connect.
You can view the report in the Amazon Connect interface, download the report, or share it with other users. You can set a schedule for the days of the week to generate the report, and you can filter the report on agent, agent hierarchy, or routing profile to include only records for a specific set of agents in the report.
Considerations

Only users that have the Login/Logout report permission see Login/Logout report listed under Metrics and quality. For more information, see Login/Logout Report Permissions.
Closing the browser does not log the user out. The report does not show that a user has logged out until the user clicks the logout button. The user is shown as logged in from the previous login until the next time the user clicks the logout button.
A Login/Logout report can contain up to 10,000 rows. When you generate a Login/Logout report that includes more than 10,000 rows, the report fails to complete. If you generate a report and view it on the Login/Logout report page, you receive an error if you attempt to display a page of the report beyond row 10,000. If you schedule a Login/Logout report that contains more than 10,000 rows, the report fails, no report output is saved to your S3 bucket, and you cannot view the report.

If you have a contact center with a lot of agents, and your reports fail to complete, you can specify a shorter time range to reduce the size of the report generated, or apply filters to the report, such as routing profile and agent hierarchy. You can then use other filters to capture all of the login/logout data for your instance. For more information, see Generate a Login/Logout Report.
Login/Logout Report Permissions
By default, only users assigned the Admin security profile for an Amazon Connect instance are granted permission to generate and view the Login/Logout reports. To allow other users to view a shared report, or to schedule or generate the report, your Amazon Connect admin must assign the Login/Logout report permission to a role assigned to that user. To enable other users in other roles to generate or view the reports, add the permission to the security role assigned to those users.
In Amazon Connect, permissions are assigned to security profiles. The permission a user has is determined by the security role assigned to the user account. Only users that are assigned a security profile that has been granted the View permission for Login/Logout reports can view published reports. If you share a link with a specific user, that user can only view the report if his or her account has explicit permission to do so using their security profile. If you do not want to grant the permission to one of the security profiles included with Amazon Connect, you can create a custom security profile and assign permissions to that role. Users can be assigned more than one security profile, so you could make a profile that grants permissions only to Login/Logout reports and then assign specified users to that profile.
To assign Login/Logout report permissions


Open the Amazon Connect dashboard.


Choose Users, Security profiles.


Select the security profile for which to modify permissions.


Choose Metrics and Quality.


In the Login/Logout report row, select All to grant all permissions, or View to only grant permissions to view shared reports.


Choose Save.


Generate a Login/Logout Report
When you generate a Login/Logout report, it includes only login or logout actions by your agents that occurred during the specified time range. If an agent logged in during the time range and did not log out, the report shows a login time but not a logout time. If the agent logged in before the start of the time range, and then logged out during the time range, the report shows both the login and logout times even though the login occurred before the start of the time range. This is so you can view the duration of the agent session associated with the most recent logout.
When you create your report, you can filter the results in the report by Agent, Agent hierarchy, Routing profile, or None (show all agents). For the time frame, you can select Today (since 12 am), Last 24 hours, Yesterday, Last 2 days, Last 3 days, or Custom time range.

Schedule a Login/Logout Report
To generate a report with the same settings on a regular basis, you can schedule the report to run daily or on specific days of the week. When you schedule a report, it is automatically published to your organization. Anyone with appropriate permissions can view the report. Users with all permissions for Login/Logout reports can also edit, schedule, or delete the report.
When you schedule your report, keep in mind that the report always runs at 12AM on the day you select, in the time zone that you choose. If you select Wednesday, the report runs at midnight Wednesday and does not include any data for Wednesday. Scheduled reports are saved as CSV files in your Amazon S3 bucket. The default time zone is UTC. To have your report run at 12AM in your local time, choose your time zone instead. 
Tip
To email a scheduled report to a list of co-workers, you need to generate the email manually using your messaging system. Amazon Connect doesn’t provide an option to email the scheduled report automatically.
