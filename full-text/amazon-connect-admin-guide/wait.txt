Contact block: Wait
Contact flow types
You can use this block in the following contact flow types:
 Inbound contact flow
 Customer Queue flow
Description

Use this block in chat contact flows only. If a contact stops responding to a chat, this block pauses the contact flow for the specified wait time. 
If this block is triggered during a voice conversation, the contact is routed down the Error branch.

Properties

It has two properties: 
 Timeout: Run this branch if the customer hasn't sent a message after a specified amount of time. Maximum is 24 hours.
 Customer return: Run this branch when the customer returns and sends a message. With this branch you can route the customer to the previous (same) agent, previous (same) queue, or override and set a new working queue or agent. 
Configuration tips
You can add multiple Wait blocks to your contact flows. For example: 
 If the customer comes back in 5 minutes, connect them to the same agent. This is because that agent has all of the context.
 If the customer doesn't come back after 5 minutes, send a text saying "We missed you." 
 If the customer comes back in 12 hours, connect to a contact flow that puts them in a priority queue. However, it doesn't route them to the same agent.
