Step 3: Set up routing
In this step, you start at the Amazon Connect console for your instance. This step shows how to set up your queues, create a routing profile, and then assign your user account to the profile. 


On the navigation menu, go to Routing, Queues. 



Choose Add new queue.



Complete the page, as shown in the following image, to add a queue named PasswordReset. When done, choose Add new queue.



Add a queue named NetworkIssue. Complete the Add new queue page like you did for the PasswordReset queue.


When done, you'll have three queues.



On the navigation menu, go to Users, Routing Profiles. 



Choose Add new profile. 



Assign a name to the new profile (for example, Test routing profile). Enter a description, select Voice, Chat, and set Maximum chats to 1.



In the Routing profile queues section, use the drop-down arrow to search for the queues you just created. Choose NetworkIssue, select Voice and Chat, and then choose Add queue.



Then add the PasswordReset queue. Select Voice and Chat, and then choose Add queue.


Under Default outbound queue, use the drop-down arrow to choose BasicQueue.



When done, scroll to the top of the page, and choose Add new profile to save the profile.


On the navigation menu, go to Users, User management. 



Select your login name, and choose Edit. 



Use the drop-down arrow to choose the routing profile you created, for example, Test routing profile. Choose Save.



Routing is all set up and ready to go.
