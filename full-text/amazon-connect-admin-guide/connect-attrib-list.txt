Contact attributes returned from a Lambda function
Attributes returned as key-value pairs from a Lambda function are external attributes. To reference external attributes in JSONPath, use $.External.attributeName, where AttributeName is the attribute name, or the key of the key-value pair returned from the function. 
For example, if the function returns a contact ID, reference the attribute with $.External.ContactId. When referencing a contact ID returned from Amazon Connect, the JSONPath is $.ContactId. Note the inclusion of .External in the JSONPath reference when the attribute is external to Amazon Connect. Make sure to match the case for attribute names returned from external sources.

User-defined attributes
To reference user-defined attributes, such as those set with the Set contact attributes block, use the drop-down menus in subsequent blocks to reference the attribute, or use the Attributes namespace in JSONPath to the attribute if used in a text field. For example, if you create a user-defined attribute in a Set contact attributes block, you reference it in one of the following ways:
 In a block that supports attributes, such as a Check contact attributes block, choose User Defined for the Type, and use the value you entered for the Destination key in the Attribute field.
 In a text field in a block, such as a Play prompt block, use the JSONPath $.Attributes.DestinationKey, replacing DestinationKey with the value you entered in the Destination key.
