Set up contact transfers
To make it easy for you to set up contact transfers, Amazon Connect provides you with several tools: 
 Two contact flow types:
   Transfer to agent: Enables transfers to another agent. This works with voice contacts. 
   Transfer to queue: Enables transfers to a queue. This works with both voice and chat contacts.
 Contact blocks:
   Transfer to queue: Use to end the current contact flow and place the customer in a queue. This block works for both voice and chat transfers. 
   Transfer to phone number: Use to transfer the customer to a phone number, such as an external number. This block works for voice transfers.
   Transfer to flow: Use to end the current flow and transfer the customer to another contact flow. This block works for voice transfers.
 Quick connects: Use to create common destinations for transfers. Agents will see them as options in the CCP when they go to do a transfer.
This topic explains how to create quick connects and use transfer contact blocks in specific scenarios. 
Overview of steps
To set up call transfers and quick connects


Choose a contact flow type based on what you want to do: Transfer to agent or Transfer to queue. External transfers do not require a specific type of contact flow.


Create and publish the contact flow. 


Create a quick connect for the type of transfer to enable: Agent, Queue, or External.


When you create the Agent or Queue quick connect, select a contact flow that matches the type of transfer to enable. External quick connects require only a phone number, and do not allow you to set a queue or contact flow.


Add the quick connect that you created to any queue used in a contact flow for which to enable contact transfer, such as the queue used in the contact flow for incoming contacts.


Make sure the queue is in a routing profile assigned to the agents who transfers contacts.
