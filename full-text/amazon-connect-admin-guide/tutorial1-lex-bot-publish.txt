Part 5: Publish the Amazon Lex bot and create an alias
Next, publish the bot so you can add it to a contact flow in Amazon Connect.


In the Amazon Lex console, choose Publish.



In the Publish HelpDesk dialog box, use the drop-down to choose the alias that you created for your bot, such as Test.



Choose Publish. The publishing takes a few minutes.


When Amazon Lex finishes publishing, choose Close. 



Well done! You created an Amazon Lex bot that has intents and utterances. Now you can add the bot to Amazon Connect. Go to Step 2: Add permissions to Amazon Lex bot.
