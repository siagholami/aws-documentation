Monitoring your instance using CloudWatch
Amazon Connect sends data about your instance to CloudWatch metrics so that you can collect, view, and analyze CloudWatch metrics for your Amazon Connect virtual contact center. You can use this data to monitor key operational metrics and set up alarms. Data about your contact center is sent to CloudWatch every 1 minute.
When you view the CloudWatch metrics dashboard, you can specify the refresh interval for the data displayed. The values displayed in the dashboard reflect the values for the refresh interval you define. For example, if you set the refresh interval to 1 minute, the values displayed are for a minute period. You can select a refresh interval of 10 seconds, but Amazon Connect does not send data more often than every 1 minute. Metrics that are sent to CloudWatch are available for two weeks, and then discarded. To learn more about metrics in CloudWatch, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Amazon Connect metrics sent to CloudWatch
The AWS/Connect namespace includes the following metrics.
CallsBreachingConcurrencyQuota
The total number of voice calls that exceeded the concurrent calls quota for the instance.
For example, assume your contact center experiences the following volumes, and your service quota is 100 concurrent calls:
 0:00 : 125 concurrent calls. This is 25 over the quota. 
 0:04 : 135 concurrent calls. This is 35 over the quota. 
 0:10 : 150 concurrent calls. This is 50 over the quota. 
CallsBreachingConcurrencyQuota = 110: the total number of voice calls that exceeded the quota between 0:00 and 0:10.
Unit: Count
Dimension:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance
CallBackNotDialableNumber
The number of times a queued callback to a customer could not be dialed because the customer's number is in a country for which outbound calls are not allowed for the instance. The countries allowed for an instance are defined by the service quotas.
Unit: Count
Dimensions:
 InstanceId The ID of your instance
 MetricGroup: ContactFlow
 ContactFlowName: The name of your contact flow
CallRecordingUploadError

Unit: Count
Dimensions:

 MetricGroup: VoiceCalls
ConcurrentCalls
The number of concurrent active voice calls in the instance at the time the data is displayed in the dashboard. The value displayed for this metric is the number of concurrent active calls at the time the dashboard is displayed, and not a sum for the entire interval of the refresh interval set. All active voice calls are included, not only active calls that are connected to agents.
While all statistics are available in CloudWatch for concurrent voice calls you might be most interested in looking at the Maximum/Average statistic. The Sum statistic isn't as useful here. 
Unit: Count
Dimensions:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance
 MetricGroup: VoiceCalls
ConcurrentCallsPercentage
The percentage of the concurrent active voice calls service quota used in the instance. This is calculated by ConcurrentCalls/ConfiguredConcurrentCallsLimit. 
Unit: Percent (output displays as a decimal)
Dimensions:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance
 MetricGroup: VoiceCalls
ContactFlowErrors
The number of times the error branch for a contact flow was executed.
Unit: Count
Dimensions:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance
 MetricGroup: ContactFlow
 ContactFlowName: The name of your contact flow
ContactFlowFatalErrors
The number of times a contact flow failed to execute due to a system error.
Unit: Count
Dimensions:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance
 MetricGroup: ContactFlow
 ContactFlowName: The name of your contact flow
LongestQueueWaitTime
The longest amount of time, in seconds, that a contact waited in a queue. This is the length of time a contact waited in a queue during the refresh interval selected in the CloudWatch dashboard, such as 1 minute or 5 minutes.
Unit: Seconds
Dimensions:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance
 MetricGroup: Queue
 QueueName: The name of your queue
MissedCalls
The number of voice calls that were missed by agents during the refresh interval selected, such as 1 minute or 5 minutes. A missed call is one that is not answered by an agent within 20 seconds.
To monitor the total missed calls in a given time period, take a look at the Sum statistic in CloudWatch.
Unit: Seconds
Dimensions:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance
 MetricGroup: VoiceCalls
MisconfiguredPhoneNumbers
The number of calls that failed because the phone number is not associated with a contact flow.
Unit: Count
Dimensions:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance
 MetricGroup: VoiceCalls
PublicSigningKeyUsage
The number of times a contact flow security key (public signing key) was used to encrypt customer input in a contact flow.
Unit: Count
Dimensions:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance
 SigningKeyId: The ID of yoru signing key
QueueCapacityExceededError
The number of calls that were rejected because the queue was full.
Unit: Count
Dimensions:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance
 MetricGroup: Queue
 QueueName: The name of your queue
QueueSize
The number of contacts in the queue. The value reflects the number of contacts in the queue at the time the dashboard is accessed, not for the duration of the reporting interval.
Unit: Count
Dimensions:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance
 MetricGroup: Queue
 QueueName: The name of your queue
ThrottledCalls
The number of voice calls that were rejected because the rate of calls per second exceeded the maximum supported quota. To increase the supported rate of calls, request an increase in the service quota for concurrent active calls per instance.
To monitor the total throttled calls in a given time period, take a look at the Sum statistic in CloudWatch.
Unit: Seconds
Unit: Count
Dimensions:
 InstanceId: The ID of your instance

Unit: Percent
Dimensions:
 Participant: Agent
 Type of Connection: WebRTC

Amazon Connect CloudWatch metrics dimensions
In CloudWatch, a dimension is a name/value pair that uniquely identifies a metric. In the dashboard, metrics are grouped by dimension. The following dimensions are used in the CloudWatch dashboard for Amazon Connect metrics. When you view metrics in the dashboard, only metrics with data are displayed. If there is no activity during the refresh interval for which there is a metric, then no data from your instance is displayed in the dashboard. The following dimensions are used for Amazon Connect metrics in CloudWatch.
Contact flow metrics dimension

If a contact flow has a dimension name in non-ASCII characters, you won't be able to see it in CloudWatch. 
Filters metric data by contact flow. Includes the following metrics:

Instance metrics dimension
Filters meta data by instance. Includes the following metrics:

Use CloudWatch metrics to calculate concurrent call quota
Here's how to calculate your quota for concurrent calls. 
With calls active in the system, look at ConcurrentCalls and ConcurrentCallsPercentage. Calculate the quota: 
 (ConcurrentCalls / ConcurrentCallsPercentage) * 100
For example, if ConcurrentCalls is 20 and ConcurrentCallsPercentage is 50, your quota is calculated as (20/50)*100 = 40.
