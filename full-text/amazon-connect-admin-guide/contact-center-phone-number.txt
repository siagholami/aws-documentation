Set up phone numbers for your contact center
After you create an Amazon Connect instance, you can claim a phone number to use for your contact center. You can use this phone number to place a test call in to your contact center to confirm that it is working correctly. You can also use it in your production environment.
For pricing information about how much a claimed phone number costs, see Amazon Connect pricing.
If you want to keep a phone number you already have, you can port the phone number and use it with Amazon Connect. After a phone number is ported to Amazon Connect, it appears in the list of available phone numbers for you to assign to contact flows.
