View a shared report
To view a report that someone has shared with you, you need the following: 
 A link to the report. 
 Permissions in your security profile: 
    Access metrics, if the report is a real-time or historical metrics report
    View Login/Logout report, if the report is a login/logout report
    View Saved reports

Tips for viewing a shared report

Every time you want to view the shared report, you need to access it through the link that was shared with you.
If you get a 505 error when you choose the link that was shared with you, it means you don't have permissions to view the report.
There's no way to save the exact same report to your list of Saved reports. You can give the report a new name and save it to your list, but then it's a different report from the one that was shared with you. If the owner of original report makes changes, you won't see them in your renamed report.
