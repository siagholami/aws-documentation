Choose the voice for audio prompts
You select the text-to-speech voice and language in the Set voice block. 
You can also use SSML in Amazon Lex bots to modify the voice used by a chat bot when interacting with your customers. For more information about using SSML in Amazon Lex bots, see Managing Messages and Managing Conversation Context in the Amazon Lex Developer Guide.
Tip
If you enter text that isn't supported for the Amazon Polly voice you are using, it won't be played. However, any other supported text in the prompt will be played. For a list of supported languages, see Languages Supported by Amazon Polly.
