Launch the CCP
The URL to launch the Contact Control Panel (CCP) is:
 https://name of your instance.awsapps.com/connect/ccp-v2/
With this updated CCP, your agents can manage both voice and chat contacts from this single interface.
As the administrator, you can also launch the CCP directly from the Amazon Connect console. Just choose the phone icon in the upper right corner.
To provide agents the ability to launch the CCP from their desktop and start handling contacts, there are a few things you need to do: 
 Add agents as users to the instance. For more information, see Manage users in Amazon Connect.
 Configure permissions for the agents. By default, agents assigned to the Agent security profile can access the CCP and make outbound calls. But you can create a custom security profile and add additional permissions. For more information, see Security profiles.
 Give agents the URL the CCP.
 Provide agents with their user name and password so that they can log in to the CCP.
We recommend telling agents to bookmark the URL to the CCP for more convenient access.
Agents can use the CCP with a softphone on their computer, or a deskphone. If they're using a softphone, they must use Chrome or Firefox for their web browser. For more information, see Grant microphone access in Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
