Assign a security profile to a user
Required permissions to assign security profiles
Before you can assign a security profile to a user, you must be logged in with an Amazon Connect account that has the Users - Edit permission. Or, if you're creating the user's account for the first time, you need Users - Create permission. 

By default, the Amazon Connect Admin security profile has these permissions.
