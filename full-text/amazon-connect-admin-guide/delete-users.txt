Delete users from your Amazon Connect instance
When a user is deleted from Amazon Connect, you won't be able to configure their agent settings any more. For example, you won't be able to assign a routing profile to them.
What happens to the user's metrics?
The user's data in CTRs and reports is retained. The data is preserved for the consistency of the historical metrics.
In the historical metrics reports, the agent's data will be included in the Agent performance metrics report. However, you won't be able to see an Agent activity audit of the deleted agent because their name won't appear in the drop-down list. 
Required permissions to delete users
Before you can update permissions in a security profile, you must be logged in with an Amazon Connect account that has the following permissions: Users - Remove.

By default, the Amazon Connect Admin security profile has these permissions.
How to delete users
You can't undo a deletion.


Log in to the Amazon Connect console with an Admin account, or an account assigned to a security profile that has permissions to remove users.


Choose the user account you want to delete, and then choose Remove.



Confirm you want to delete that account.



Note the status of account. Choose Back to return to the User management page.
