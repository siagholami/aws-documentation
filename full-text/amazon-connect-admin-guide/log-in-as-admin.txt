Log in as Administrator
A user assigned to the Admin security profile can log in to an Amazon Connect instance with full administrator permissions from the Amazon Connect console. This can be helpful if you forget the password for the administrator account. 
As long as you know the credentials for your AWS account, you can sign in to Amazon Connect using your admin account.
To log in with administrator permissions


Open the Amazon Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/.


Choose the name of the instance from the Instance Alias column.



In the navigation pane, choose Overview.


Choose Log in as administrator.



You aren't prompted for your credentials because you are federated in from the AWS console.
To log out
To log out of your instance, go to the title bar at the top of the screen and select the icon with the arrow (Log out) that appears next to your user name.
