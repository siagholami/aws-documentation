Default customer whisper: beep sound
This contact flow uses a Set whisper flow block to play a message for the customer when the customer and agent are joined. It uses a "beep" sound to notify a customer that their call has been connected to an agent. 
Use the Set whisper flow block to override the default agent whisper in a voice conversation.
