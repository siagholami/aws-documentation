My CCP URL ends with /ccp#
Upgrading to the latest CCP is easy. If you want, you can try out the latest CCP and then at a later date make the switch. Here's what you do:


Try it out: Change the URL in your browser from /ccp# to /ccp-v2. The latest CCP appears automatically. If you want, change it back to /ccp# to return to the earlier CCP. 


Upgrade: Change the URL in your browser from /ccp# to /ccp-v2. Bookmark the URL. 


If you access the CCP through the Amazon Connect console by choosing the phone icon on the top right of a page, you will be re-directed according to the automatic upgrade date sent by email. Please reach out to your Amazon Solution Architect if your request is more urgent. 



Verify your network settings
We highly recommend setting up your network to use Option 1 (recommended): Replace Amazon EC2 and CloudFront IP range requirements with a domain allow list. 
Using this option helps Amazon Connect Support to quickly troubleshoot any issues you have. Specifically, using *.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com passes more metrics to our Support team to help with troubleshooting. 
Compare the earlier and latest CCP
