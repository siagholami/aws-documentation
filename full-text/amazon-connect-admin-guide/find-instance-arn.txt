Find your Amazon Connect instance ID/ARN
When you open a support ticket, you may be asked to provide your Amazon Connect instance ID (also called the ARN). Use the following steps to find it. 


Open the Amazon Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/.


On the instances page, click on the instance alias. The instance alias is also your instance name, which appears in your Amazon Connect URL. For example, in https://mytest88.awsapps.com/connect/home the instance name is mytest88.



This will take you to a page that displays the instance ARN.
