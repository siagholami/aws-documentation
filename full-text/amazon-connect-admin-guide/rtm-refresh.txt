How often real-time metrics refresh
Data in real-time metrics reports is refreshed as follows:
 The Real-time metrics page refreshes every 15 seconds, as long as the page is active. For example, if you have multiple tabs open in your browser and navigate to a different tab, the real-time metric page won't be updated until you return to it.
 Metrics such as Active and Availability refresh as activity occurs, with a small system delay for processing the activity.
 Agent near real-time metrics, such as Missed and Occupancy, refresh every 5 minutes.
 Contact near real-time metrics refresh about a minute after a contact ends.
