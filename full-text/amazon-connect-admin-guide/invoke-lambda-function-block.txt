Contact flow types

 Inbound contact flow

Description

Calls AWS Lambda, and optionally returns key-value pairs.
The returned key-value pairs can be used to set contact attributes.

Properties

Note the following properties: 
 Timeout: Enter how long to wait for Lambda to time out. This creates a branch for you to specify what to do if it times out. 
If your Lambda invocation gets throttled, the request is retried. It is also retried if a general service failure (500 error) happens. 
When a synchronous invocation returns an error, Amazon Connect retries up to three times, for a maximum of 8 seconds. At that point, the contact is routed down the Error branch.
Configuration tips

To use an AWS Lambda function in a contact flow, first add the function to your instance. For more information, see Add a Lambda function to your Amazon Connect instance, 
After you add the function to your instance, you can select the function from the Select a function drop-down list in the block to use it in the contact flow.
