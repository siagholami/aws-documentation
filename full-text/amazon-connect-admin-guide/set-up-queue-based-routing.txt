Set up queue-based (skills-based) routing
Here's an overview of the steps to set up queue-based routing:
 Create the queues, for example, one for each skill you want to use for routing.
 Create the routing profiles:
   Specify the channels supported by this routing profile.
   Specify the queues: the channel, priority, and delay.
 Configure agent settings to assign the routing profiles to them.
When you create your contact flows, you'll add the queues to them. If a contact chooses to speak to an agent in Spanish, for example, they will be routed to the Spanish Reservations queue.
