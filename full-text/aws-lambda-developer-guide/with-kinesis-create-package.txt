Sample function code
To process events from Amazon Kinesis, iterate through the records included in the event object and decode the Base64-encoded data included in each.
Note
The code on this page does not support aggregated records. You can disable aggregation in the Kinesis Producer Library configuration, or use the Kinesis Record Aggregation library to deaggregate records.
Sample code is available for the following languages.
Topics
 Node.js 8
 Java 11
 C#
 Python 3
 Go

The following example code receives a Kinesis event input and processes the messages that it contains. For illustration, the code writes some of the incoming event data to CloudWatch Logs.
Example index.js 
```
console.log('Loading function');
exports.handler = function(event, context) {
    //console.log(JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));
    event.Records.forEach(function(record) {
        // Kinesis data is base64 encoded so decode here
        var payload = Buffer.from(record.kinesis.data, 'base64').toString('ascii');
        console.log('Decoded payload:', payload);
    });
};
```

Java 11
The following is example Java code that receives Kinesis event record data as input and processes it. For illustration, the code writes some of the incoming event data to CloudWatch Logs. 
In the code, recordHandler is the handler. The handler uses the predefined KinesisEvent class that is defined in the aws-lambda-java-events library.
Example ProcessKinesisEvents.java 
```
package example;
import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context;
import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestHandler;
import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.events.KinesisEvent;
import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.events.KinesisEvent.KinesisEventRecord;
public class ProcessKinesisRecords implements RequestHandler{
  @Override
  public Void handleRequest(KinesisEvent event, Context context)
  {
    for(KinesisEventRecord rec : event.getRecords()) {
      System.out.println(new String(rec.getKinesis().getData().array()));
  }
  return null;
  }
}
```
If the handler returns normally without exceptions, Lambda considers the input batch of records as processed successfully and begins reading new records in the stream. If the handler throws an exception, Lambda considers the input batch of records as not processed and invokes the function with the same batch of records again.

C#
The following is example C# code that receives Kinesis event record data as input and processes it. For illustration, the code writes some of the incoming event data to CloudWatch Logs. 
In the code, HandleKinesisRecord is the handler. The handler uses the predefined KinesisEvent class that is defined in the Amazon.Lambda.KinesisEvents library. 
Example ProcessingKinesisEvents.cs 
```
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using Amazon.Lambda.Core;
using Amazon.Lambda.KinesisEvents;
namespace KinesisStreams
{
    public class KinesisSample
    {
        [LambdaSerializer(typeof(JsonSerializer))]
        public void HandleKinesisRecord(KinesisEvent kinesisEvent)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Beginning to process {kinesisEvent.Records.Count} records...");
        foreach (var record in kinesisEvent.Records)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Event ID: {record.EventId}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Event Name: {record.EventName}");

            string recordData = GetRecordContents(record.Kinesis);
            Console.WriteLine($"Record Data:");
            Console.WriteLine(recordData);
        }
        Console.WriteLine("Stream processing complete.");
    }

    private string GetRecordContents(KinesisEvent.Record streamRecord)
    {
        using (var reader = new StreamReader(streamRecord.Data, Encoding.ASCII))
        {
            return reader.ReadToEnd();
        }
    }
}
