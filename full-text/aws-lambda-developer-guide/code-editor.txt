Creating functions using the AWS Lambda console editor
The code editor in the AWS Lambda console enables you to write, test, and view the execution results of your Lambda function code.
The code editor includes the menu bar, windows, and the editor pane.

For a list of what the commands do, see the Menu commands reference in the AWS Cloud9 User Guide. Note that some of the commands listed in that reference are not available in the code editor.
