DeleteFunction
Deletes a Lambda function. To delete a specific function version, use the Qualifier parameter. Otherwise, all versions and aliases are deleted.
To delete Lambda event source mappings that invoke a function, use DeleteEventSourceMapping. For AWS services and resources that invoke your function directly, delete the trigger in the service where you originally configured it.
