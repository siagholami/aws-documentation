Orchestrating functions with Step Functions
AWS Step Functions is an orchestration service that lets you connect Lambda functions together into serverless workflows, called state machines. Use Step Functions to orchestrate serverless applications workflows (for example, a store checkout process), build long-running workflows for IT automation and human-approval use cases, or create high-volume short-duration workflows for streaming data processing and ingestion.
