IAM: Manage a specific tag
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows adding and removing the IAM tag with the tag key Department. This policy does not limit the value of the Department tag. This policy grants the permissions necessary to complete this action from the AWS API or AWS CLI only. To use this policy, replace the italicized placeholder text in the example policy with your own information. Then, follow the directions in create a policy or edit a policy.
