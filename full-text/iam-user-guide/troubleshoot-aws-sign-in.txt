I need my AWS account ID or AWS account alias
If you are an IAM user and you are not signed in, you must ask your administrator for the AWS account ID or AWS account alias. You need this information, plus your IAM user name and password, to sign in to an AWS account.
I forgot my IAM user name or password
If you are an IAM user, your administrator provides your credentials. If you forget your password, you must ask your administrator to reset it.
For security purposes, AWS doesn't have access to view, provide, or change your credentials.
I forgot the root user password for my AWS account
If you are a root user and you have lost or forgot the password for your AWS account, you can reset your password. You must know the email address used to create the AWS account and you must have access to the email account. For more information, see Resetting lost or forgotten passwords or access keys for AWS.
I don't have access to the email for my AWS account
When you create an AWS account, you provide an email address and password. These are the credentials for the AWS account root user. If you are not sure of the email address associated with your AWS account, check for saved correspondence from no-reply@amazon.com to any email address for your organization that might have been used to open the AWS account.
If you know the email address but no longer have access to the email, first try to recover access to the email using one of the following options:
 If you own the domain for email address, you can restore a deleted email address. Alternatively, you can set up a catch-all for your email account, which "catches all" messages sent to email addresses that no longer exist in the mail server and redirects them to another email address.
 If the email address on the account is part of your corporate email system, we recommend that you contact your IT system administrators. They might be able to help you regain access to the email.
If you're still not able to sign in to your AWS account, you can find alternate support options atÂ Contact us. Expand I cannot login to my AWS account and choose Request Support for AWS Account Credentials. Provide the information in the form and choose Submit.
I need to change the credit card for my AWS account
To change the credit card for your AWS account, you must be able to sign in. AWS has protections in place that require you to prove that you're the account owner. For directions, see Managing your credit card payment methods in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
I need to report fraudulent AWS account activity
If you suspect fraudulent activity using your AWS account and would like to make a report, see How do I report abuse of AWS resources.
If you are having trouble with a purchase made on Amazon.com, see Amazon Customer Service.
I need to close my AWS account
If you have an AWS account, you can use the following directions to close it: Closing an Account in the Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
