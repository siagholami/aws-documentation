AWS Lambda: Allows a Lambda function to access an Amazon DynamoDB table
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows read and write access to a specific Amazon DynamoDB table. The policy also allows writing log files to CloudWatch Logs. To use this policy, replace the italicized placeholder text in the example policy with your own information. Then, follow the directions in create a policy or edit a policy.
To use this policy, attach the policy to a Lambda service role. A service role is a role that you create in your account to allow a service to perform actions on your behalf. That service role must include AWS Lambda as the principal in the trust policy. For details about how to use this policy, see How to Create an AWS IAM Policy to Grant AWS Lambda Access to an Amazon DynamoDB Table in the AWS Security Blog.
