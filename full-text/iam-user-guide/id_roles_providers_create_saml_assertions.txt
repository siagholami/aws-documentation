Configuring SAML assertions for the authentication response
In your organization, after a user's identity has been verified, the external identity provider (IdP) sends an authentication response to the AWS SAML endpoint at https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml. This response is a POST request that includes a SAML token that adheres to the HTTP POST Binding for SAML 2.0 standard and that contains the following elements, or claims. You configure these claims in your SAML-compatible IdP. Refer to the documentation for your IdP for instructions on how to enter these claims.
When the IdP sends the response containing the claims to AWS, many of the incoming claims map to AWS context keys. These context keys can be checked in IAM policies using the Condition element. A listing of the available mappings follows in the section Mapping SAML attributes to AWS trust policy context keys.
Subject And NameID
The following excerpt shows an example. Substitute your own values for the marked ones. There must be exactly one SubjectConfirmation element with a SubjectConfirmationData element that includes both the NotOnOrAfter attribute and a Recipient attribute. These attributes include a value that must match the AWS endpoint (https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml), as shown in the following example. For information about the name identifier formats supported for single sign-on interactions, see Oracle Sun OpenSSO Enterprise Administration Reference. 
<Subject>
  <NameID Format="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent">_cbb88bf52c2510eabe00c1642d4643f41430fe25e3</NameID>
  <SubjectConfirmation Method="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer">
    <SubjectConfirmationData NotOnOrAfter="2013-11-05T02:06:42.876Z" Recipient="https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml"/>
  </SubjectConfirmation>
</Subject>
AudienceRestriction And Audience
For security reasons, AWS should be included as an audience in the SAML assertion your IdP sends to AWS. For the value of the Audience element, specify either https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml or urn:amazon:webservices. The following sample XML snippets from SAML assertions show how this key can be specified by the IdP. Include whichever sample applies to your use case.
<Conditions>
  <AudienceRestriction>
    <Audience>https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml</Audience>
  </AudienceRestriction>
</Conditions>
<Conditions>
  <AudienceRestriction>
    <Audience>urn:amazon:webservices</Audience>
  </AudienceRestriction>
</Conditions>
Important
The SAML AudienceRestriction value in the SAML assertion from the IdP does not map to the saml:aud context key that you can test in an IAM policy. Instead, the saml:aud context key comes from the SAML recipient attribute because it is the SAML equivalent to the OIDC audience field, for example, by accounts.google.com:aud.
SAML role Attribute
You can use an Attribute element with the Name attribute set to https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/Role. This element contains one or more AttributeValue elements that list the IAM identity provider and role to which the user is mapped by your IdP. The IAM role and IAM identity provider are specified as a comma-delimited pair of ARNs in the same format as the RoleArn and PrincipalArn parameters that are passed to AssumeRoleWithSAML. This element must contain at least one role-provider pair (AttributeValue element), and can contain multiple pairs. If the element contains multiple pairs, then the user is asked to select which role to assume when they use WebSSO to sign into the AWS Management Console.
Important
The value of the Name attribute in the Attribute tag is case-sensitive. It must be set to https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/Role exactly.
<Attribute Name="https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/Role">
  <AttributeValue>arn:aws:iam::account-number:role/role-name1,arn:aws:iam::account-number:saml-provider/provider-name</AttributeValue>
  <AttributeValue>arn:aws:iam::account-number:role/role-name2,arn:aws:iam::account-number:saml-provider/provider-name</AttributeValue>
  <AttributeValue>arn:aws:iam::account-number:role/role-name3,arn:aws:iam::account-number:saml-provider/provider-name</AttributeValue>
</Attribute>
SAML RoleSessionName Attribute
You can use an Attribute element with the Name attribute set to https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/RoleSessionName. This element contains one AttributeValue element that provides an identifier for the AWS temporary credentials that are issued for SSO. This element is used to display user information in the AWS Management Console. The value in the AttributeValue element must be between 2 and 64 characters long, can contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and the following characters:  (plus sign), = (equals sign), , (comma), . (period), @ (at symbol), and - (hyphen). It cannot contain spaces. The value is typically a user ID (johndoe) or an email address (johndoe@example.com). It should not be a value that includes a space, like a user's display name (John Doe).
Important
The value of the Name attribute in the Attribute tag is case-sensitive. It must be set to https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/RoleSessionName exactly.
<Attribute Name="https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/RoleSessionName">
  <AttributeValue>user-id-name</AttributeValue>
</Attribute>
SAML SessionDuration Attribute
(Optional) You can use an Attribute element with the Name attribute set to https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/SessionDuration". This element contains one AttributeValue element that specifies how long the user can access the AWS Management Console before having to request new temporary credentials. The value is an integer representing the number of seconds for the session. The value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 43200 seconds (12 hours). If this attribute is not present, then the credential last for one hour (the default value of the DurationSeconds parameter of the AssumeRoleWithSAML API).
To use this attribute, you must configure the SAML provider to provide single sign-on access to the AWS Management Console through the console sign-in web endpoint at https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml. Note that this attribute extends sessions only to the AWS Management Console. It cannot extend the lifetime of other credentials. However, if it is present in an AssumeRoleWithSAML API call, it can be used to shorten the duration of the session. The default lifetime of the credentials returned by the call is 60 minutes. 
Note, too, that if a SessionNotOnOrAfter attribute is also defined, then the lesser value of the two attributes, SessionDuration or SessionNotOnOrAfter, establishes the maximum duration of the console session.
When you enable console sessions with an extended duration the risk of compromise of the credentials rises. To help you mitigate this risk, you can immediately disable the active console sessions for any role by choosing Revoke Sessions on the Role Summary page in the IAM console. For more information, see Revoking IAM role temporary security credentials. 
Important
The value of the Name attribute in the Attribute tag is case-sensitive. It must be set to https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/SessionDuration exactly.
<Attribute Name="https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/SessionDuration">
  <AttributeValue>1800</AttributeValue>
</Attribute>
SAML PrincipalTag Attribute
(Optional) You can use an Attribute element with the Name attribute set to https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/PrincipalTag:{TagKey}. This element allows you to pass attributes as session tags in the SAML assertion. For more information about session tags, see Passing session tags in AWS STS.
To pass attributes as session tags, include the AttributeValue element that specifies the value of the tag. For example, to pass the tag key-value pairs Project = Marketing and CostCenter = 12345, use the following attribute. Include a separate Attribute element for each tag.
<Attribute Name="https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/PrincipalTag:Project">
  <AttributeValue>Marketing</AttributeValue>
</Attribute>
<Attribute Name="https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/PrincipalTag:CostCenter">
  <AttributeValue>12345</AttributeValue>
</Attribute>
To set the tags above as transitive, include another Attribute element with the Name attribute set to https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/TransitiveTagKeys. This is an optional multivalued attribute that sets your session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist when you use the SAML session to assume another role in AWS. This is known as role chaining. For example, to set both the Principal and CostCenter tags as transitive, use the following attribute to specify the keys.
<Attribute Name="https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/TransitiveTagKeys">
  <AttributeValue>Project</AttributeValue>
  <AttributeValue>CostCenter</AttributeValue>
</Attribute>
Mapping SAML attributes to AWS trust policy context keys
The tables in this section list commonly used SAML attributes and how they map to trust policy condition context keys in AWS. You can use these keys to control access to a role. To do that, compare the keys to the values that are included in the assertions that accompany a SAML access request.
Important
These keys are available only in IAM trust policies (policies that determine who can assume a role) and are not applicable to permissions policies.
In the eduPerson and eduOrg attributes table, values are typed either as strings or as lists of strings. For string values, you can test these values in IAM trust policies using StringEquals or StringLike conditions. For values that contain a list of strings, you can use the ForAnyValue and ForAllValues policy set operators to test the values in trust policies.
Note
You should include only one claim per AWS context key. If you include more than one, only one claim will be mapped.
