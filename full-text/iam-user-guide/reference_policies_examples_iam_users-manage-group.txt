IAM: Allows specific IAM users to manage a group programmatically and in the console
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows specific IAM users to manage the AllUsers group. This policy also grants the necessary permissions to complete this action on the console. To use this policy, replace the italicized placeholder text in the example policy with your own information. Then, follow the directions in create a policy or edit a policy.
What does this policy do?
 The AllowAllUsersToListAllGroups statement allows listing all groups. This is necessary for console access. This permission must be in its own statement because it does not support a resource ARN. Instead the permissions specify "Resource" : "*".
 The AllowAllUsersToViewAndManageThisGroup statement allows all group actions that can be performed on the group resource type. It does not allow the ListGroupsForUser action, which can be performed on a user resource type and not a group resource type. For more information about the resource types that you can specify for an IAM action, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Identity and Access Management.
 The LimitGroupManagementAccessToSpecificUsers statement denies users with the specified names access to write and permissions managment group actions. When a user specified in the policy attempts to make changes to the group, this statement does not deny the request. That request is allowed by the AllowAllUsersToViewAndManageThisGroup statement. If other users attempt to perform these operations, the request is denied. You can view the IAM actions that are defined with the Write or Permissions management access levels while creating this policy in the IAM console. To do this, switch from the JSON tab to the Visual editor tab. For more information about access levels. see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Identity and Access Management.
