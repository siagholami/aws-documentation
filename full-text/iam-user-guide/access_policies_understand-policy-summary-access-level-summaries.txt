Understanding access level summaries within policy summaries
AWS access level summary
Policy summaries include an access level summary that describes the action permissions defined for each service that is mentioned in the policy. To learn about policy summaries, see Understanding permissions granted by a policy. Access level summaries indicate whether the actions in each access level (List, Read, Write, and Permissions management) have Full or Limited permissions defined in the policy. To view the access level classification that is assigned to each action in a service, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Services.
The following example describes the access provided by a policy for the given services. For examples of full JSON policy documents and their related summaries, see Examples of policy summaries.




Service
Access level
This policy provides the following




IAM
Full access
Access to all actions within the IAM service.


CloudWatch
Full: List
Access to all CloudWatch actions in the List access level, but no access to actions with the Read, Write, or Permissions management access level classification.


Data Pipeline
Limited: List, Read
Access to at least one but not all AWS Data Pipeline actions in the List and Read access level, but not the Write or Permissions management actions.


EC2
Full: List, Read Limited: Write
Access to all Amazon EC2 List and Read actions and access to at least one but not all Amazon EC2 Write actions, but no access to actions with the Permissions management access level classification.


S3
Limited: Read, Write, Permissions management
Access to at least one but not all Amazon S3 Read, Write and Permissions management actions.


CodeDeploy
(empty)
Unknown access, because IAM does not recognize this service.


API Gateway
None
No access is defined in the policy.


CodeBuild
 No actions are defined.
No access because no actions are defined for the service. To learn how to understand and troubleshoot this issue, see My policy does not grant the expected permissions.



As previously mentioned, Full access indicates that the policy provides access to all the actions within the service. Policies that provide access to some but not all actions within a service are further grouped according to the access level classification. This is indicated by one of the following access-level groupings:
 Full: The policy provides access to all actions within the specified access level classification.
 Limited: The policy provides access to one or more but not all actions within the specified access level classification.
 None: The policy provides no access.
 (empty): IAM does not recognize this service. If the service name includes a typo, then the policy provides no access to the service. If the service name is correct, then the service might not support policy summaries or might be in preview. In this case, the policy might provide access, but that access cannot be shown in the policy summary. To request policy summary support for a generally available (GA) service, see Service does not support IAM policy summaries.
Access level summaries that include limited (partial) access to actions are grouped using the AWS access level classifications List, Read, Write, Permissions Management, or Tagging.
AWS access levels
AWS defines the following access level classifications for the actions in a service:
 List: Permission to list resources within the service to determine whether an object exists. Actions with this level of access can list objects but cannot see the contents of a resource. For example, the Amazon S3 action ListBucket has the List access level. 
 Read: Permission to read but not edit the contents and attributes of resources in the service. For example, the Amazon S3 actions GetObject and GetBucketLocation have the Read access level.
 Write: Permission to create, delete, or modify resources in the service. For example, the Amazon S3 actions CreateBucket, DeleteBucket and PutObject have the Write access level. Write actions might also allow modifying a resource tag. However, an action that allows only changes to tags has the Tagging access level.
 Permissions management: Permission to grant or modify resource permissions in the service. For example, most IAM and AWS Organizations actions, as well as actions like the Amazon S3 actions PutBucketPolicy and DeleteBucketPolicy have the Permissions management access level.
Tip
To improve the security of your AWS account, restrict or regularly monitor policies that include the Permissions management access level classification.
 Tagging: Permission to perform actions that only change the state of resource tags. For example, the IAM actions TagRole and UntagRole have the Tagging access level because they allow only tagging or untagging a role. However, the CreateRole action allows tagging a role resource when you create that role. Because the action does not only add a tag, it has the Write access level.
