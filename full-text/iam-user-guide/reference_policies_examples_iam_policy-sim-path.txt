IAM: Access the policy simulator API based on user path
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows using the policy simulator API only for those users that have the path Department/Development. This policy grants the permissions necessary to complete this action from the AWS API or AWS CLI only. To use this policy, replace the italicized placeholder text in the example policy with your own information. Then, follow the directions in create a policy or edit a policy.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy",
                "iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:user/Department/Development/*"
        }
    ]
}
Note
To create a policy that allows using the policy simulator console for those users that have the path Department/Development, see IAM: Access the policy simulator console based on user path.
