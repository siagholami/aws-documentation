Amazon EC2: Allows starting or stopping EC2 instances a user has tagged, programmatically and in the console
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows an IAM user to start or stop EC2 instances, but only if the instance tag Owner has the value of that user's user name. This policy also grants the necessary permissions to complete this action on the console.
