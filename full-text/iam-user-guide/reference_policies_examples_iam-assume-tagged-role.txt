IAM: Assume roles that have a specific tag
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows an IAM user to assume roles with the tag key-value pair Project = ExampleCorpABC. This policy grants the permissions necessary to complete this action from the AWS API or AWS CLI only. To use this policy, replace the italicized placeholder text in the example policy with your own information. Then, follow the directions in create a policy or edit a policy. 
If a role with this tag exists in the same account as the user, then the user can assume that role. If a role with this tag exists in an account other than the user's, it requires additional permissions. The cross-account role's trust policy must also allow the user or all members of the user's account to assume the role. For information about using roles for cross-account access, see Providing access to an IAM user in another AWS account that you own.
