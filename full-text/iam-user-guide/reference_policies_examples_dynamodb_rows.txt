Amazon DynamoDB: Allows row-level access to DynamoDB based on an Amazon Cognito ID
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows row-level access to the MyTable DynamoDB table based on an Amazon Cognito ID. This policy grants the permissions necessary to complete this action from the AWS API or AWS CLI only. To use this policy, replace the italicized placeholder text in the example policy with your own information. Then, follow the directions in create a policy or edit a policy.
To use this policy, you must structure your DynamoDB table so the Cognito user ID is the partition key. For more information, see Creating a Table in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
To learn more about DynamoDB condition keys, see Specifying Conditions: Using Condition Keys in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
