OnFailure
A destination for events that failed processing.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template, use the following syntax.
YAML
[Destination](#sam-function-onfailure-destination): String
  [Type](#sam-function-onfailure-type): String
Properties
Destination 
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination resource.
Type: String
Required: Conditional
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is similar to the [OnFailure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-eventinvokeconfig-destinationconfig-onfailure.html#cfn-lambda-eventinvokeconfig-destinationconfig-onfailure-destination) property of an AWS::Lambda::EventInvokeConfig resource. SAM will add any necessary permissions to the auto-generated IAM Role associated with this function to access the resource referenced in this property.
Additional Notes: If the type is Lambda/EventBridge, Destination is required.
Type 
Type of the resource referenced in the destination. Supported types are SQS, SNS, Lambda, and EventBridge.
Type: String
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
Additional Notes: If the type is SQS/SNS and the Destination property is left blank, then the SQS/SNS resource is auto generated by SAM. To reference the resource, use <function-logical-id>.DestinationQueue for SQS or <function-logical-id>.DestinationTopic for SNS. If the type is Lambda/EventBridge, Destination is required.
Examples
EventInvoke Configuration Example with SQS and Lambda destinations
In this example no Destination is given for the SQS OnSuccess configuration, so SAM implicitly creates a SQS queue and adds any necessary permissions. Also for this example, a Destination for a Lambda resource declared in the template file is specified in the OnFailure configuration, so SAM adds the necessary permissions to this Lambda function to call the destination Lambda function.
YAML
EventInvokeConfig:
  DestinationConfig:
    OnSuccess:
      Type: SQS
    OnFailure:
      Type: Lambda
      Destination: !GetAtt DestinationLambda.Arn  # Arn of a Lambda function declared in the template file.
EventInvoke Configuration Example with SNS destination
In this example a Destination is given for an SNS topic declared in the template file for the OnSuccess configuration.
YAML
EventInvokeConfig:
  DestinationConfig:
    OnSuccess:
      Type: SNS
      Destination:
        Ref: DestinationSNS       # Arn of an SNS topic declared in the tempate file
