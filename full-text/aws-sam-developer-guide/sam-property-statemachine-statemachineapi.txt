Api
The object describing an Api event source type. If an AWS::Serverless::Api resource is defined, the path and method values must correspond to an operation in the OpenAPI definition of the API.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template, use the following syntax.
YAML
[Auth](#sam-statemachine-statemachineapi-auth): ApiStateMachineAuth
  [Method](#sam-statemachine-statemachineapi-method): String
  [Path](#sam-statemachine-statemachineapi-path): String
  [RestApiId](#sam-statemachine-statemachineapi-restapiid): String
Properties
Auth 
The authorization configuration for this API, path, and method.
Use this property to override the API's DefaultAuthorizer setting for an individual path, when no DefaultAuthorizer is specified, or to override the default ApiKeyRequired setting.
Type: ApiStateMachineAuth
Required: No

RestApiId 
The identifier of a RestApi resource, which must contain an operation with the given path and method. Typically, this is set to reference an AWS::Serverless::Api resource that is defined in this template.
If you don't define this property, AWS SAM creates a default AWS::Serverless::Api resource using a generated OpenApi document. That resource contains a union of all paths and methods defined by Api events in the same template that do not specify a RestApiId.
This property can't reference an AWS::Serverless::Api resource that is defined in another template.
Type: String
