AWS::Serverless::Function
Creates a Lambda function, IAM execution role, and event source mappings that trigger the function.
The AWS::Serverless::Function resource also supports the Metadata resource attribute, so you can instruct AWS SAM to build custom runtimes required by your application. For more information about building custom runtimes, see Building Custom Runtimes.

Properties
AssumeRolePolicyDocument 
Adds an AssumeRolePolicyDocument for the default created Role for this function. If this property isn't specified, AWS SAM adds a default assume role for this function.
Type: JSON
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is similar to the [AssumeRolePolicyDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-role.html#cfn-iam-role-assumerolepolicydocument) property of an AWS::IAM::Role resource. AWS SAM adds this property to the generated IAM role for this function. If a role ARN is provided for this function, this property does nothing.
AutoPublishAlias 
Name of the Lambda alias. For more information about Lambda aliases, see AWS Lambda Function Aliases. For examples that use this property, see Deploying Serverless Applications Gradually.
AWS SAM generates AWS::Lambda::Version and AWS::Lambda::Alias resources when this property is set. For information about this scenario, see AutoPublishAlias Property Is Specified. For general information about generated AWS CloudFormation resources, see Generated AWS CloudFormation Resources.
Type: String
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
AutoPublishCodeSha256 
The string value that is used (along with the value in CodeUri) to determine if a new Lambda version should be published.
This property addresses a problem that occurs when an AWS SAM template has the following characteristics: the DeploymentPreference object is configured for gradual deployments (as described in Deploying Serverless Applications Gradually), the AutoPublishAlias property is set and doesn't change between deployments, and the CodeUri property is set and doesn't change between deployments.
This scenario might occur when the deployment package stored in an Amazon S3 location is replaced by a new deployment package that contains updated Lambda function code, but the CodeUri property remains unchanged (as opposed to the new deployment package being uploaded to a new Amazon S3 location and the CodeUri being changed to the new location).
In this scenario, you must provide a unique value for AutoPublishCodeSha256 to trigger the gradual deployment successfully.
Type: String
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
CodeUri 
The Amazon S3 URI, local file path, or FunctionCode object of the function code.
If an Amazon S3 URI or FunctionCode object is provided, the Amazon S3 object referenced must be a valid Lambda deployment package.
If a local file path is provided, the template must go through the workflow that includes the sam deploy or sam package command, in order for the code to be transformed properly.
Note: Either CodeUri or InlineCode is required.
Type: String | FunctionCode
Required: Conditional
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is similar to the [Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-function.html#cfn-lambda-function-code) property of an AWS::Lambda::Function resource. The nested Amazon S3 properties are named differently.
DeadLetterQueue 
Configures SNS topic or SQS queue where Lambda sends events that it can't process. For more information about dead-letter queue functionality, see AWS Lambda Function Dead Letter Queues.
Type: Map | DeadLetterQueue
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is similar to the [DeadLetterConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-function-deadletterconfig.html) property of an AWS::Lambda::Function resource. In AWS CloudFormation the type is derived from the TargetArn, whereas in AWS SAM you must pass the type along with the TargetArn.
DeploymentPreference 
The settings to enable gradual Lambda deployments.
If a DeploymentPreference object is specified, AWS SAM creates an AWS::CodeDeploy::Application called ServerlessDeploymentApplication (one per stack), an AWS::CodeDeploy::DeploymentGroup called <function-logical-id>DeploymentGroup, and an AWS::IAM::Role called CodeDeployServiceRole.
Type: DeploymentPreference
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
See also: See the Deploying Serverless Applications Gradually documentation for more information about this property.

This property accepts a single string or a list of strings. The property can be the name of AWS managed AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, AWS SAM policy templates, or one or more inline policy documents formatted as a map.
For more information about AWS managed IAM policies, see AWS Managed Policies. For more information about AWS SAM policy templates, see AWS SAM Policy Templates. For more information about inline policies, see Inline Policies.
NOTE: If the Role property is set, this property is ignored.

AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is similar to the [Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-role.html#cfn-iam-role-policies) property of an AWS::IAM::Role resource. AWS SAM supports AWS managed policy names and AWS SAM policy templates, in addition to JSON policy documents. AWS CloudFormation only accepts JSON policy documents.

This is required in AWS CloudFormation but not in AWS SAM. If a role isn't specified, one is created for you with a logical ID of <function-logical-id>Role.
Runtime 
The identifier of the function's runtime.
Note: If you specify the provided identifier for this property, you can use the Metadata resource attribute to instruct AWS SAM to build the custom runtime required by this function. For more information about building custom runtimes, see Building Custom Runtimes.
