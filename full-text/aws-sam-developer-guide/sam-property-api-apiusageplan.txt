Configures a usage plan for an API Gateway API. For more information about usage plans, see Create and Use Usage Plans with API Keys in the API Gateway Developer Guide.
Syntax

YAML
[CreateUsagePlan](#sam-api-apiusageplan-createusageplan): String
  [Description](#sam-api-apiusageplan-description): String
  [Quota](#sam-api-apiusageplan-quota): [QuotaSettings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-usageplan.html#cfn-apigateway-usageplan-quota)
  [Tags](#sam-api-apiusageplan-tags): List
  [Throttle](#sam-api-apiusageplan-throttle): [ThrottleSettings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-usageplan.html#cfn-apigateway-usageplan-throttle)
  [UsagePlanName](#sam-api-apiusageplan-usageplanname): String
Properties
CreateUsagePlan 
Determines how this usage plan is configured. Valid values are PER_API, SHARED, and NONE.
PER_API creates AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlan, AWS::ApiGateway::ApiKey, and AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlanKey resources that are specific to this API. These resources have logical IDs of <api-logical-id>UsagePlan, <api-logical-id>ApiKey, and <api-logical-id>UsagePlanKey, respectively.
SHARED creates AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlan, AWS::ApiGateway::ApiKey, and AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlanKey resources that are shared across any API that also has CreateUsagePlan: SHARED in the same AWS SAM template. These resources have logical IDs of ServerlessUsagePlan, ServerlessApiKey, and ServerlessUsagePlanKey, respectively. If you use this option, we recommend that you add additional configuration for this usage plan on only one API resource to avoid conflicting definitions and an uncertain state.
NONE disables the creation or association of a usage plan with this API. This is only necessary if SHARED or PER_API is specified in the Globals Section of the Template.
