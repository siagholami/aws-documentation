AWS CloudFormation Support for AWS IoT Things Graph
AWS CloudFormation is a service that can help you create, manage, and replicate your AWS resources. You can use AWS CloudFormation templates to define AWS IoT Things Graph flows (workflows) that you want to deploy.
The resources and infrastructure that you generate from a template is called a stack. You can define all of your resources in one template or refer to resources from other stacks. For more information about AWS CloudFormation templates and features, see What Is AWS CloudFormation? in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
Creating Resources
AWS CloudFormation templates are JSON or YAML documents that describe the properties and relationships of AWS resources. 
The following AWS IoT Things Graph resources are supported:
 Flows (workflows)
In AWS CloudFormation templates, the structure and syntax of AWS IoT Things Graph resources are based on the AWS IoT Things Graph API. For example, you create a flow by assigning values to the definition and compatibleNamespaceVersion parameters. For more information, see AWS IoT Things Graph API Reference.
