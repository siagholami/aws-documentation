The System construct creates an abstract structure that consists of devices and services. 
The devices implemented in a specific instance of a System have a physical presence. TDM supplies constructs that associate Systems with physical structures and that arrange the positioning of devices in those structures.
TDM includes modeling for the following concepts:
 System deployments for specific physical structures
The topics in this section describe the constructs that TDM provides for locating systems in physical locations.
