Key Management
All connections to AWS IoT Things Graph are done using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, so client-side encryption keys aren't necessary for the initial TLS connection. Devices must authenticate using an X.509 certificate. AWS IoT can generate a certificate for you, in which case it generates a public/private key pair. 
You can generate a certificate in the following ways:
 If you're using the AWS IoT console, you're prompted to download the certificate and keys. 
 If you're using the create-keys-and-certificate AWS CLI command, the AWS CLI returns the certificate and keys.
Important
You're responsible for copying the certificate and private key to your device and keeping it safe.
