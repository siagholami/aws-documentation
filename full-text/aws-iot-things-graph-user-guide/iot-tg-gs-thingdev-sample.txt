Creating a Flow with Devices and a Service
This topic walks you through the steps to create and deploy a simple workflow (flow) that consists of a Raspberry Pi connected to three devices: an Aukru HC-SR501 motion sensor, a Raspberry Pi camera, and a Raspberry Pi screen. It also contains an AWS IoT Things Graph service model that exposes the face detection capability of Amazon Rekognition.
The flow is triggered when the motion detector detects a person moving. The motion detector sends a message to the camera, which takes a picture and sends it to the Amazon Rekognition service model. The service model sends the image to display to the screen. The service model doesn't process the results of the DetectFaces API or send anything other than the image to the screen. 
You can modify this example by adding a service model between the Amazon Rekognition service and the screen. The additional service model can process the results (such as determining whether the image should be displayed on the screen) before sending the image to the screen.
Prerequisites
To create this example, you need the following resources: 
 An AWS account
 A Raspberry Pi running AWS IoT Greengrass version 1.7 or later
 An Aukru HC-SR501 motion sensor
 A Raspberry Pi 7" touchscreen display
 A Raspberry Pi camera module v2-8 megapixel,1080p
 An Amazon S3 bucket
Set Up Your Raspberry Pi
To run the workflow (flow), you need to set up your Raspberry Pi.
  Attach your motion sensor to Raspberry Pi GPIO pin 1. 
  Attach the camera by following the instructions in the Raspberry Pi camera board documentation. Attach the screen by following the instructions in the Raspberry Pi 7" touch screen assembly guide. 
  Download and install the drivers included in the ThingsGraphPrototypeDevices.zip file. Follow the instructions in the README to install the drivers.
Now you've configured your Raspberry Pi to communicate with the motion sensor, camera, and screen.
Create an AWS IoT Greengrass Group
Note
For information about using AWS CloudFormation to create and manage AWS IoT Greengrass groups and resources, see AWS IoT Greengrass Resource Types Reference.
Install AWS IoT Greengrass on the same Raspberry Pi to which you attached your motion sensor, camera, and screen. 
Perform the steps in Setting Up Your Environment on your Raspberry Pi. Make sure that you've created an IAM role for AWS IoT Greengrass (step 4 in the Create an AWS IoT Greengrass group procedure in that topic). Attach the AmazonS3FullAccess policy to give it access to your S3 bucket.
Note
The AWS IoT Greengrass group and Amazon S3 bucket that you use in this example must be created in the same AWS Region. The AWS IoT Things Graph entities that you create must also be in the same Region as these resources.
Create Things
Open the AWS IoT console and create three things: one thing for your motion sensor, and two things for the camera and screen that are attached to your Raspberry Pi. 
For instructions on how to create things in the registry, see Register a Device in the Registry. 
On the Greengrass tab in the AWS IoT console, choose your group, choose Devices, and then add the three new things to your AWS IoT Greengrass group.
For general information about AWS IoT concepts, see What is AWS IoT?
Create and Publish the Flow
To create this flow with the AWS CLI instead of the AWS IoT Things Graph console, follow the instructions in Creating a Flow with Devices and a Service by Using the AWS CLI.

Open the AWS IoT Things Graph console.

Choose Create flow.


Create a flow.

In the Flow configuration pane that appears, name your flow (such as RekognitionFlow). Choose Create flow.


Add the device models and service model to the flow.


Search for the MotionSensor device model. Select the device and drag it into the flow designer.


Search for the CameraRkgnExample device model. Select the device model and drag it into the flow designer. 


On the Services tab, search for the Rekognition service model. Select the service model and drag it into the flow designer. 


On the Devices tab, do the same for the Screen device model.



Connect the device models.


In the flow designer, select the edge of the MotionSensor device model and connect it to the CameraRkgnExample device model. Then connect the CameraRkgnExample device model, Rekognition service model, and the Screen device model in the same way. 


Update the motion sensor trigger.

In the trigger editor that appears in the right pane, for Condition, choose StateChanged. For Action, choose ThingsGraph.startFlow.


Update the camera device model action.


In the flow designer, select the CameraRkgnExample device model.


In the action editor that appears in the right pane, select No action configured.


For Action, choose capture.


Expand Output, and then enter cameraRkgnExampleResult.


Update the Rekognition service model activity.


In the flow designer, select the Rekognition service model.


In the action editor that appears in the right pane, select No action configured.


For Action, choose detectFaces.


Expand Inputs, and then choose Define Input.


For bucketName, enter ${cameraRkgnExampleResult.s3BucketName}.


For itemName, enter ${cameraRkgnExampleResult.s3ItemName}.


Expand Output, and then enter rekognitionResult.


Update the screen device model activity.


In the flow designer, select the Screen device model.


In the action editor that appears in the right pane, select No action configured.


For Action, choose display.


Expand Inputs, and then choose Define Input.


For imageUrl, enter ${cameraRkgnExampleResult.lastClickedImage}.


Publish the flow.


Choose Publish at the upper right of the page. This creates the flow and adds it to the list of flows that can be deployed.
Asscoiate Things to Device Models

Associate things to device models.

Select the menu icon at the upper left of the page. Then choose Things. 

On the Things page, select the motion sensor thing that you created earlier. Then choose Associate with device.



On the Select device model page, choose HCSR501MotionSensor. Choose Associate. This step associates the HCSR501MotionSensor motion sensor thing in your registry with the motion sensor device model in your flow. The HCSR501MotionSensor device implements the capability of the motion sensor device model.



After you return to the Select device model page, refresh the page to verify that the motion sensor thing is associate with the HCSR501MotionSensor device. Repeat the previous two steps for the RaspberryPiCameraRkgnExample and RaspberryPiScreen devices.


Create and Deploy the Flow Configuration

Create the flow configuration.

Select the menu icon at the upper left of the page, and then select Flows to return to the Flows page. On the Flows page, select the box next to the flow that you just created, and then choose Create flow configuration.


Name the flow configuration.

On the Describe flow configuration page, select your flow, and then enter a flow configuration name. The flow configuration name can't contain spaces. Choose Greengrass, and then choose Next.

Configure the target.

On the Configure target page, enter the name of your Amazon S3 bucket and the AWS IoT Greengrass group to which your AWS IoT Greengrass core device belongs. Amazon S3 buckets are globally unique, so your bucket name will be different from the one in the following screen shot. Choose Next. 


Select things for your deployment.

The Map Things page provides an interface for selecting the specific things that you'll include in your deployment. The menus under each device model in your deployment contain all of the things that you associated with the device model. Because you're getting started, the menus for each device model on this page will include only one thing (the thing that you've associated with each device model).
On the Map Things page, for motionSensor, select the motion sensor thing that you created earlier. Select the camera and screen things for the Camera and Screen device models. Choose Next.

View the trigger.

On the Define trigger page, the GraphQL that defines the motion event trigger for the flow appears in the editor. When the motion sensor detects motion, the ThingsGraph.startFlow function initiates the flow. You don't need to edit this code.
Choose Review. 


Review and create.

On the Review and create page, review the information you entered for your flow configuration. Choose Create.

Deploy.

When the Flow configuration created message appears, choose Deploy now.
Refresh the Deployments page to verify that the flow has deployed. After a successful deployment, the Deployments page displays Deployed in target in the Status column.
Run the Flow
Because the screen doesn't use information returned by the Amazon Rekognition service model, the steps for running this flow are the same as those in Creating a Flow with Devices. 
Delete the Flow and Flow Configuration (Optional)
For instructions on how to undeploy a flow configuration, and delete the flow configuration and flow that you've created, see Deleting Flow Configurations and Deleting Systems, Flows, and Namespaces in Lifecycle Management for AWS IoT Things Graph Entities, Flows, Systems, and Deployments.
