Modeling Entities
This section describes how to create and work with the entities that compose a workflow (flow) after you create them in the AWS IoT Things Graph Data Model (TDM). 
Entities include Properties, States, Events, Actions, Capabilities, Mappings, Devices, and Services. 
After you create these entities in TDM, you upload them to your namespace by using the UploadEntityDefinitions API.
For complete example device models and services, see Example Device and Service Definitions.
