To download and install the client application


On your iPad, open Amazon WorkSpaces Client Downloads and choose the iPad link.


Download and install the application.


Verify that the Amazon WorkSpaces client application icon appears on one of the iPad desktops.


Connecting to Your WorkSpace
To connect to your WorkSpace, complete the following procedure.
To connect to your WorkSpace


On your iPad, open the Amazon WorkSpaces client application.


The first time that you run the client application, you are prompted for your registration code, which is contained in your welcome email. The Amazon WorkSpaces client application uses the registration code and user name to identify which WorkSpace to connect to. When you launch the client application later, the same registration code is used. You can enter a different registration code by launching the client application and choosing Enter new registration code on the login screen.


Enter your user name and password and choose Sign In. If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has enabled multi-factor authentication for your organization's WorkSpaces, you are prompted for a passcode to complete your login. Your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator will provide more information about how to obtain your passcode.


If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has not disabled the "Remember Me" feature, you are prompted to save your credentials securely so that you can connect to your WorkSpace easily in the future. Your credentials will be securely cached up to the maximum lifetime of your Kerberos ticket.


After the client application connects to your WorkSpace, your WorkSpace desktop is displayed.
