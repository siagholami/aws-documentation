Amazon WorkSpaces Web Access
Users can access their Windows WorkSpaces from any location using a web browser. This is ideal for users who must use a locked-down device or restrictive network. Instead of using a traditional remote access solution and installing the appropriate client application, users can visit the website to access their work resources.
Note
A web browser cannot be used to connect to Amazon Linux WorkSpaces.
Important
Beginning October 1, 2020, customers will no longer be able to use the Amazon WorkSpaces Web Access client to connect to Windows 7 custom WorkSpaces or to Windows 7 Bring Your Own License (BYOL) WorkSpaces.
