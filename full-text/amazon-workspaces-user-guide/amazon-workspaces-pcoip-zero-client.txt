PCoIP Zero Client
You can set up and use a PCoIP zero client device with Amazon WorkSpaces. For more information, see Connecting to Amazon WorkSpaces Desktops in the PCoIP Connection Manager User Guide.
Requirements
To use a PCoIP zero client with Amazon WorkSpaces, you need the following:
 If your Tera2 zero client device has firmware version 6.0.0 or later, you can connect to your WorkSpace directly without using PCoIP Connection Manager.
 If your Tera2 zero client device has a firmware version between 4.6.0 and 6.0.0, your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator must set up an EC2 instance with Teradici PCoIP Connection Manager for Amazon WorkSpaces. Your administrator also provides you with a server URI that you can use to connect to your WorkSpace.
 WorkSpaces multi-factor authentication requires a Tera2 zero client device with firmware version 6.0.0 or later.
For a list of approved PCoIP zero client devices, see PCoIP Zero Clients on the Teradici website.
