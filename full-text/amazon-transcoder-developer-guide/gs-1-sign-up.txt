Step 1: Sign Up for AWS
To use Elastic Transcoder, you need an AWS account. If you don't already have an account, you'll be prompted to create one when you sign up. You're not charged for any AWS services that you sign up for unless you use them.
To sign up for AWS


Open https://aws.amazon.com/, and then choose Create an AWS Account.
Note
If you previously signed in to the AWS Management Console using AWS account root user credentials, choose Sign in to a different account. If you previously signed in to the console using IAM credentials, choose Sign-in using root account credentials. Then choose Create a new AWS account.


Follow the online instructions.


Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code using the phone keypad.
