Monitoring Elastic Transcoder
Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Elastic Transcoder and your AWS solutions. You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multi-point failure if one occurs. Before you start monitoring Elastic Transcoder; however, you should create a monitoring plan that includes answers to the following questions:
 What are your monitoring goals?
 What resources will you monitor?
 How often will you monitor these resources?
 What monitoring tools will you use?
 Who will perform the monitoring tasks?
 Who should be notified when something goes wrong?
The next step is to establish a baseline for normal Elastic Transcoder performance in your environment, by measuring performance at various times and under different load conditions. As you monitor Elastic Transcoder, store historical monitoring data so that you can compare it with current performance data, identify normal performance patterns and performance anomalies, and devise methods to address issues.
For example, if you're using Amazon EC2, you can monitor CPU utilization, disk I/O, and network utilization for your instances. When performance falls outside your established baseline, you might need to reconfigure or optimize the instance to reduce CPU utilization, improve disk I/O, or reduce network traffic.
To establish a baseline you should, at a minimum, monitor the following items:
 Jobs completed
 Jobs errored
 StandbyTime
 Errors
 Throttles
Topics
 Monitoring Tools
