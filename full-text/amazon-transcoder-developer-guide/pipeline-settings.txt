Settings that You Specify When You Create an Elastic Transcoder Pipeline
When you create a pipeline using the Elastic Transcoder console, you can specify the following values.
Topics
 Region
 General Settings
 Configure Amazon S3 Bucket for Transcoded Files and Playlists
 Configure Amazon S3 Bucket for Thumbnails
 Notifications
Region
Elastic Transcoder creates your pipeline in the region you are in. Choose the region you plan to run jobs in.
General Settings
Pipeline Name
The name of the pipeline. We recommend that the name be unique within the AWS account, but uniqueness is not enforced. The maximum length of a pipeline name is 40 characters. 
Input Bucket
The Amazon S3 bucket in which you saved the media files that you want to transcode and the graphics files, if any, that you want to use for watermarks.
IAM Role
The IAM Amazon Resource name (ARN) for the role that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to transcode jobs for this pipeline.
AWS KMS Key ARN
The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that you want to use with this pipeline.
If you use either s3 or s3-aws-kms as your Encryption:Mode, you don't need to provide a key with your job because a default key, known as an AWS-KMS key, is created for you automatically. You need to provide an AWS-KMS key only if you want to use a non-default AWS-KMS key, or if you are using an Encryption:Mode of aes-pkcs7, aes-ctr, or aes-gcm.
Configure Amazon S3 Bucket for Transcoded Files and Playlists
Use the settings in this section to specify the Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save transcoded files and playlists for jobs that are submitted to this pipeline, the Amazon S3 storage class that you want to assign to the files, which users you want to have access to the files, and the type of access you want users to have. 
Bucket
The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save transcoded files and playlists (if applicable) for jobs that you submit to this pipeline.
Storage Class
The Amazon S3 storage class, Standard or Reduced Redundancy, that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the transcoded files and playlists that it stores in your Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Reduced Redundancy Storage in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
Grantee Type
Specify how you want to identify the users or groups that you want to have access to transcoded files and playlists. When you select a grantee type, the Grantee Type field appears:
 Canonical: The value of Grantee is either the canonical user ID for an AWS account or an origin access identity for an Amazon CloudFront distribution. For more information about canonical user IDs, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. For more information about using CloudFront origin access identities to require that users use CloudFront URLs instead of Amazon S3 URLs, see Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.
Important
A canonical user ID is not the same as an AWS account number.
 Email: The value of Grantee is the registered email address of an AWS account.
 Group: The value of Grantee is one of the following predefined Amazon S3 groups: AllUsers, AuthenticatedUsers, or LogDelivery.
Grantee
The AWS user or group that you want to have access to transcoded files and playlists. To identify the user or group, you can specify the canonical user ID for an AWS account, an origin access identity for a CloudFront distribution, the registered email address of an AWS account, or a predefined Amazon S3 group. For more information, see Grantee Type.
Access*
The permission that you want to give to the AWS user that you specified in Grantee. Permissions are granted on the transcoded files and playlists that Elastic Transcoder adds to the bucket. Valid values include:
 Open/Download: The grantee can read the objects and metadata for transcoded files and playlists that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.
 View Permissions*: The grantee can read the object ACL for transcoded files and playlists that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.
 *Edit Permissions*: The grantee can write the ACL for transcoded files and playlists that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.
 *Full Control*: The grantee has permissions to read objects, and view and edit the ACL for transcoded files and playlists that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.
