Modifying Presets in Elastic Transcoder
Elastic Transcoder doesn't allow you to change the settings in an existing preset. This is true both for the default presets included with Elastic Transcoder and the presets you've added. However, you can easily achieve the same result by making a copy of the preset that you want to change, changing the applicable settings, saving the new preset, and deleting the old preset, as the following procedure explains.
To modify a preset using the Elastic Transcoder console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Elastic Transcoder console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/.


In the navigation bar of the Elastic Transcoder console, select the region that contains the preset that you want to change. 


In the left pane of the console, click Presets.


Select the check box for the preset that you want to change.


Click Copy.


Change the applicable values in the copy of the preset that you want to change. For more information about each field, see Settings that You Specify When You Create an Elastic Transcoder Preset.


Click Create Preset.


Back on the Presets page, select the check box for the old version of the preset.


Click Remove.
