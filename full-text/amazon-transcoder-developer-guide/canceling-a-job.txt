Canceling an Elastic Transcoder Job
You can cancel a job that still has a status of Submitted, which means that Elastic Transcoder hasn't started to transcode your file. The following procedure explains how to cancel a job using the Elastic Transcoder console. 
To cancel a job using the API, pause the corresponding pipeline so Elastic Transcoder doesn't start processing the job, list jobs that have a status of Submitted to get the applicable job ID, then cancel the job using the job ID to identify which job you want to cancel. For more information, see:

To cancel a job using the Elastic Transcoder console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Elastic Transcoder console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/.


In the navigation bar of the Elastic Transcoder console, select the region in which you want to cancel a job.


Optional but recommended: Pause the pipeline to which you submitted the job, so Elastic Transcoder doesn't begin to process the job. You can't cancel a job after Elastic Transcoder begins to process it.


In the navigation (left) pane, click Pipelines.


Select the check box next to the pipeline that you want to pause.


Click Pause.


In the navigation pane of the console, click Jobs.


On the Jobs page, specify the following values:
Search By
Click Status.
Job Status
Select Submitted.
You can only cancel a job that has a status of Submitted.


For Order and Number of Jobs, enter the applicable values.


Click Search.


In the search results, if you need to view more details about a job to determine whether it's the one you want to cancel, click the  icon next to the job.


To cancel a job, select the check box next to the job, and click Cancel.


If you paused the pipeline in Step 3, reactivate it so it resumes processing jobs.


In the navigation pane, click Pipelines.


Select the check box next to the pipeline that you want to reactivate.


Click Activate.
