 Settings that You Specify When You Create an Elastic Transcoder Job
A job does the work of transcoding a media file from one format into another format. When you create a job, you specify the information that Elastic Transcoder needs to perform the transcoding: which file to transcode, what to name the transcoded file, which preset to use (a preset is a template that contains the settings that you want Elastic Transcoder to apply), and so on.
