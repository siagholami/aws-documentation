Creating CloudWatch Alarms to Monitor Elastic Transcoder
You can create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an Amazon SNS message when the alarm changes state. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period you specify, and performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic or Auto Scaling policy. Alarms invoke actions for sustained state changes only. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state; the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods.
How can I track the wait time before my job is started?
You can use the Standyby Time metric to track how long it takes a pipeline to start your transcoding jobs.

Fill in the Name, Description, and Whenever values for the metric. 


For Actions, choose an existing Amazon SNS topic.
