Changing Provisioned Product Owner
You can change the owner of a provisioned product anytime. You need to know the ARN of the user or role you want to set as the new owner. 
By default, this feature is available to administrators using the AWSServiceCatalogAdminFullAccess managed policy. You can enable it for end users by granting them the servicecatalog:UpdateProvisionedProductProperties permission in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). 
To change the owner of a provisioned product


In the AWS Service Catalog console, choose Provisioned products list. 


Locate the provisioned product you want to update, then choose the three dots beside it and choose Change provisioned product owner. You can also find the Change owner option on the provisioned product's detail page, in the Actions menu. 


In the dialog box, enter the ARN of the user or role you want to set as the new owner. An ARN begins with arn: and includes other information separated by colons or slashes, for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/NewOwner. 


Choose Submit. You will see a success message when the owner has been updated.
