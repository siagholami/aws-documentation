Granting Access to Users
Give users access to portfolios by using IAM users, groups, and roles. The best way to provide portfolio access for many users is to put the users in an IAM group and grant access to that group. That way you can simply add and remove users from the group to manage portfolio access. For more information, see IAM Users and Groups in the IAM User GuideUsing IAM.
In addition to access to a portfolio, IAM users must also have access to the AWS Service Catalog end user console. You grant access to the console by applying permissions in IAM. For more information, see Identity and Access Management in AWS Service Catalog.
To grant portfolio access to users or groups


In the portfolio details page, expand Users, groups and roles, and then choose Add user, group or role.


Choose the Groups, Users, or Roles tab to add groups, users, or roles, respectively.


Choose one or more users, groups, or roles, and then choose Add Access to grant them access to the current portfolio.
Tip
To grant access to a combination of groups, users, and roles, you can switch between the tabs without losing your selection.
