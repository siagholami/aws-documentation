Adding Products
To add products to a portfolio, you either create a new product or add an existing product from your catalog to the portfolio.
Note
The AWS CloudFormation template that you upload when you create an AWS Service Catalog product is stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that starts with cf-templates- in your AWS account. Do not delete these files unless you are sure that they are no longer in use.
Adding a New Product
You add new products directly from the portfolio details page. When you create a product from this page, AWS Service Catalog adds it to the currently selected portfolio. You can also add a product to other portfolios. 
To add a new product


Navigate to the Portfolios page, and then choose the name of the portfolio to which you want to add the product.


On the portfolio details page, expand the Products section, and then choose Upload new product. 


For Enter product details, enter the following:
    Product name – The name of the product.
    Short description – The short description. This description appears in search results to help the user choose the correct product.
    Description – The full description. This description is shown in the product listing to help the user choose the correct product.
    Provided by – The name or email address of your IT department or administrator.
    Vendor (optional) – The name of the application's publisher. This field allows users to sort their products list to makes it easier to find the products that they need.

For Enter support details, enter the following:
    Email contact (optional) – The email address for reporting issues with the product.
    Support link (optional) – A URL to a site where users can find support information or file tickets. The URL must begin with http:// or https://.

On the Version details page, enter the following:
    Select template – An AWS CloudFormation template from a local drive or a URL that points to a template stored in Amazon S3. If you specify an Amazon S3 URL, it must begin with https://. The extension for the template file must be .template.
    Version title – the name of the product version (e.g., "v1", "v2beta"). No spaces are allowed. 
    Description (optional) – A description of the product version including how this version differs from the previous version.

On the Review page, verify that the information is correct, and then choose Confirm and upload. After a few seconds, the product appears in your portfolio. You might need to refresh your browser to see the product.

Adding an Existing Product
You can add existing products to a portfolio from three places: the Portfolios list, the portfolio details page, or the Products page.

Navigate to the Portfolios page. 


Choose a portfolio, and then choose Add product. 


Choose a product, and then choose Add product to portfolio. 


Removing a Product from a Portfolio
When you no longer want users to use a product, remove it from a portfolio. The product is still available in your catalog from the Products page, and you can still add it to other portfolios. You can remove multiple products from a portfolio at one time.
To remove a product from a portfolio


Navigate to the Portfolios page, and then choose the portfolio that contains the product. The portfolio details page opens.
