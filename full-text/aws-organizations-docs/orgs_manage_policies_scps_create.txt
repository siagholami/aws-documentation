Creating and updating SCPs
When signed in with permissions to your organization's master account, you can create and update service control policies (SCPs). You create SCPs by building statements that deny or allow access to services and actions that you specify.
The default configuration for working with SCPs is to create statements that deny access. With deny statements, you can also specify resources and conditions for the statement and use the NotAction element. For allow statements, you can specify services and actions only.
For more information about statements that deny access and allow access, see Strategies for using SCPs.
Tip
You can use service last accessed data in IAM to update your SCPs to restrict access to only the AWS services that you need. For more information, see Viewing Organizations Service Last Accessed Data for Organizations in the IAM User Guide. 
Creating an SCP
To create SCPs, you need permission to run the following action:
 organizations:CreatePolicy
To create a service control policy (console)


Sign in to the Organizations console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/. You must sign in as an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user (not recommended) in the organization's master account.


On the Policies tab, choose Service control policies. 


On the Service control policies page, choose Create policy.


On the Create policy page, enter a name and description for the policy.


To build the policy, your next steps vary depending on whether you want to add a statement that denies or allows access. With deny statements, you have additional control because you can restrict access to specific resources, define conditions for when SCPs are in effect, and use the NotAction element. For more information, see SCP syntax.


To add a statement that denies access:


In the left pane of the Policy section, choose the service to add actions for.
As you choose options on the left, the right pane updates to show the JSON policy. You can also type or paste policies in the editor in the Policy section's right pane. However, this procedure describes how to use the visual editor on the left to build your SCP. 


From the list that opens of available actions for that service, choose the action or actions to deny. 


Specify resources to include in the statement. 

Choose Add resource.
On the Add resource screen, choose the service from the list and then choose the Resource type. Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in Resource ARN.
Choose Add resource.
Tip
The resource element is required. If you want to specify all resources for the selected service, edit the resource statement in the right pane to read "Resource":"*".



(Optional) To specify conditions for when a policy is in effect, choose Add condition. For the selected service, specify the following:

Condition key – You can specify a condition key that is available for all AWS services (for example, aws:SourceIp) or a service-specific key (for example, ec2:InstanceType). 
Qualifier – (Optional) If you enter multiple values for the condition, you can specify a qualifier for testing requests against the values.

Operator – You can use operators to restrict access based on comparing a key to a value. 
For any condition operator except the Null condition, you can choose the IfExists option. 
       Value – (Optional) Specify one or more values for the condition.


Choose Add condition.
For more information about condition keys, see IAM JSON Policy Elements: Condition in the IAM User Guide. 


(Optional) To use the NotAction element to deny access to all of the listed resources except for specified actions, replace Action in the left pane with NotAction, just after the "Effect": "Deny", element. For more information, see IAM JSON Policy Elements: NotAction in the IAM User Guide. 


To add a statement that allows access:


In the right pane of the Policy section, change "Effect": "Deny" to "Effect": "Allow".


In the left pane of the Policy section, choose the service to add actions for.
As you choose options on the left, the right pane updates to show the JSON policy. You can also type or paste policies in the editor in the Policy section's right pane. However, this procedure describes how to use the visual editor on the left to build your SCP. 


From the list that opens of available actions for that service, choose the action or actions to allow. 


(Optional) To add another statement to the policy, choose Add statement and use the visual editor to build the next statement. 


When you're finished adding statements, choose Create policy to save the completed SCP.


Your new SCP appears in the list of the organization's policies. You can now attach your SCP to the root, OUs, or accounts.
Note
SCPs don't take effect on the master account and in a few other situations. For more information, see Tasks and entities not restricted by SCPs.
To create a service control policy (AWS CLI, AWS API)
You can use one of the following commands to create an SCP:
 AWS CLI: aws organizations create-policy
 AWS API: CreatePolicy
Updating an SCP
When signed in to your organization's master account, you can rename or change the contents of a policy. Changing the contents of an SCP immediately affects any users, groups, and roles in all attached accounts.
To update an SCP, you need permission to run the following actions:
 organizations:UpdatePolicy with a Resource element in the same policy statement that includes the ARN of the specified policy (or "*")
 organizations:DescribePolicy with a Resource element in the same policy statement that includes the ARN of the specified policy (or "*")
To update a policy (console)


Sign in to the Organizations console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user (not recommended) in the organization's master account.


Choose the Policies tab. 


On the Policies tab, choose Service control policies.


Choose the policy that you want to update.


In the details pane on the right, choose Policy editor.


Choose Edit to enable making changes to the policy.


Make your changes by editing the policy in the right pane. For deny statements, you can also use the visual editor in the left pane to make changes. When you're finished, choose Save changes.


To update a policy (AWS CLI, AWS API)
You can use one of the following commands to update a policy: 
 AWS CLI: aws organizations update-policy
 AWS API: UpdatePolicy

Deleting a policy
When signed in to your organization's master account, you can delete a policy that you no longer need in your organization. 
Notes
Before you can delete a policy, you must first detach it from all attached entities. 
You can't delete any AWS managed SCP such as the SCP named FullAWSAccess.
To delete an SCP, you need permission to run the following action:
 organizations:DeletePolicy
To delete a policy (console)


Sign in to the Organizations console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user (not recommended) in the organization's master account.


The policy that you want to delete must first be detached from all roots, OUs, and accounts. Follow the steps in Detaching an SCP from the organization root, OUs, or accounts to detach the policy from all entities in the organization.


On the Policies tab, choose Service control policies.


On the Service control policies page, choose the SCP to delete.


Choose Delete policy.


To delete a policy (AWS CLI, AWS API)
You can use one of the following commands to delete a policy:
 AWS CLI: aws organizations delete-policy
 AWS API: DeletePolicy
