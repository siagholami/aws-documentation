CreateStreamProcessor
Creates an Amazon Rekognition stream processor that you can use to detect and recognize faces in a streaming video.
Amazon Rekognition Video is a consumer of live video from Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. Amazon Rekognition Video sends analysis results to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.
You provide as input a Kinesis video stream (Input) and a Kinesis data stream (Output) stream. You also specify the face recognition criteria in Settings. For example, the collection containing faces that you want to recognize. Use Name to assign an identifier for the stream processor. You use Name to manage the stream processor. For example, you can start processing the source video by calling StartStreamProcessor with the Name field. 
After you have finished analyzing a streaming video, use StopStreamProcessor to stop processing. You can delete the stream processor by calling DeleteStreamProcessor.

Request Parameters
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 Input  
Kinesis video stream stream that provides the source streaming video. If you are using the AWS CLI, the parameter name is StreamProcessorInput.
Type: StreamProcessorInput object
Required: Yes
 Name  
An identifier you assign to the stream processor. You can use Name to manage the stream processor. For example, you can get the current status of the stream processor by calling DescribeStreamProcessor. Name is idempotent. 
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.
Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9_.\-] 
Required: Yes
 Output  
Kinesis data stream stream to which Amazon Rekognition Video puts the analysis results. If you are using the AWS CLI, the parameter name is StreamProcessorOutput.
Type: StreamProcessorOutput object
Required: Yes
 RoleArn  
ARN of the IAM role that allows access to the stream processor.
Type: String
Pattern: arn:aws:iam::\d{12}:role/?[a-zA-Z_0-9=,.@\-_/] 
Required: Yes
 Settings  
Face recognition input parameters to be used by the stream processor. Includes the collection to use for face recognition and the face attributes to detect.
Type: StreamProcessorSettings object
Required: Yes
Response Syntax

   "[StreamProcessorArn](#rekognition-CreateStreamProcessor-response-StreamProcessorArn)": "string"
}
Response Elements
If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.
The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.
 StreamProcessorArn  
ARN for the newly create stream processor.
Type: String
