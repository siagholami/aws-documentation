Point
The X and Y coordinates of a point on an image. The X and Y values returned are ratios of the overall image size. For example, if the input image is 700x200 and the operation returns X=0.5 and Y=0.25, then the point is at the (350,50) pixel coordinate on the image.
An array of Point objects, Polygon, is returned by DetectText and by DetectCustomLabels. Polygon represents a fine-grained polygon around a detected item. For more information, see Geometry.
