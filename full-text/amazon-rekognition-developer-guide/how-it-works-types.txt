Types of Analysis
The following are the types of analysis that the Amazon Rekognition Image API and Amazon Rekognition Video API can perform. For information about the APIs, see Image and Video Operations.
Labels
A label refers to any of the following: objects (for example, flower, tree, or table), events (for example, a wedding, graduation, or birthday party), concepts (for example, a landscape, evening, and nature) or activities (for example, getting out of a car). Amazon Rekognition can detect labels in images and videos. However activities are not detected in images. For more information, see Detecting Objects and Scenes.
To detect labels in images, use DetectLabels. To detect labels in stored videos, use StartLabelDetection.
Custom Labels
Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels can identify the objects and scenes in images that are specific to your business needs by training a machine learning model. For example, you can train a model to detect logos or detect engineering machine parts on an assembly line.
Note
For information about Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels, see the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide.
Amazon Rekognition provides a console that you use to create, train, evaluate, and run a machine learning model. For more information, see Getting Started with Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Develope Guide. You can also use the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels API to train and run a model. For more information, see Getting Started with the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels SDK in the Amazon Rekognition CustomLabels Developer Guide.
To analyze images using a trained model, use DetectCustomLabels.
Faces
Amazon Rekognition can detect faces in images and stored videos. With Amazon Rekognition, you can get information about where faces are detected in an image or video, facial landmarks such as the position of eyes, and detected emotions such as happy or sad. You can also compare a face in an image with faces detected in another image. Information about faces can also be stored for later retrieval. For more information, see Detecting and Analyzing Faces.
To detect faces in images, use DetectFaces. To detect faces in stored videos, use StartFaceDetection.
Face Search
Amazon Rekognition can search for faces. Facial information is indexed into a container known as a collection. Face information in the collection can then be matched with faces detected in images, stored videos, and streaming video. For more information, Searching Faces in a Collection.
To search for known faces in images, use DetectFaces. To search for known faces in stored videos, use StartFaceDetection. To search for known faces in streaming videos, use CreateStreamProcessor.
People Paths
Amazon Rekognition can track the paths of people detected in a stored video. Amazon Rekognition Video provides path tracking, face details, and in-frame location information for people detected in a video. For more information, see People Pathing. 
To detect people in stored videos, use StartPersonTracking.
Celebrities
Amazon Rekognition can recognize thousands of celebrities in images and stored videos. You can get information about where a celebrity's face is located on an image, facial landmarks, and the pose of a celebrity's face. You can get tracking information for celebrities as they appear throughout a stored video. You can also get further information about a recognized celebrity. For more information, see Recognizing Celebrities. 
To recognize celebrities in images, use RecognizeCelebrities. To recognize celebrities in stored videos, use StartCelebrityRecognition.
Text Detection
Amazon Rekognition Text in Image can detect text in images and convert it into machine-readable text. For more information, see Detecting Text.
To detect text in images, use DetectText.
Unsafe Content
Amazon Rekognition can analyze images and stored videos for adult and violent content. For more information, see Detecting Unsafe Content.
To detect unsafe images, use DetectModerationLabels. To detect unsafe stored videos, use StartContentModeration.
