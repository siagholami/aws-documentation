Exercise 4: See Aggregated Metrics (Console)
The Amazon Rekognition metrics pane shows activity graphs for an aggregate of individual Rekognition metrics over a specified period of time. For example, the SuccessfulRequestCount aggregated metric shows the total number of successful requests to all Rekognition API operations over the last seven days. 
The following table lists the graphs displayed in the Rekognition metrics pane and the corresponding Rekognition metric. For more information, see CloudWatch Metrics for Rekognition.

Each graph shows aggregated metric data collected over a specified period of time. A total count of aggregated metric data for the time period is also displayed. To see metrics for individual API calls, choose the link beneath each graph.
To allow users access to the Rekognition metrics pane, ensure that the user has appropriate CloudWatch and Rekognition permissions. For example, a user with AmazonRekognitionReadOnlyAccess and CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess managed policy permissions can see the metrics pane. If a user does not have the required permissions, when the user opens the metrics pane, no graphs appear. For more information, see Identity and Access Management for Amazon Rekognition.
For more information about monitoring Rekognition with CloudWatch see Monitoring Rekognition.
