StartFaceSearch
Starts the asynchronous search for faces in a collection that match the faces of persons detected in a stored video.
The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Video to specify the bucket name and the filename of the video. StartFaceSearch returns a job identifier (JobId) which you use to get the search results once the search has completed. When searching is finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in NotificationChannel. To get the search results, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetFaceSearch and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartFaceSearch. For more information, see  Searching Stored Videos for Faces.

Request Parameters
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 ClientRequestToken  
Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use the same token with multiple StartFaceSearch requests, the same JobId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from being accidently started more than once. 
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]$ 
Required: No
 CollectionId  
ID of the collection that contains the faces you want to search for.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.
Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9_.\-] 
Required: Yes
 FaceMatchThreshold  
The minimum confidence in the person match to return. For example, don't return any matches where confidence in matches is less than 70%. The default value is 80%.
Type: Float
Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 100.
Required: No
 JobTag  
An identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notification that's published to your Amazon Simple Notification Service topic. For example, you can use JobTag to group related jobs and identify them in the completion notification.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9_.\-:] 
Required: No
 NotificationChannel  
The ARN of the Amazon SNS topic to which you want Amazon Rekognition Video to publish the completion status of the search. 
Type: NotificationChannel object
Required: No
 Video  
The video you want to search. The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. 
Type: Video object
Required: Yes

}
Response Elements
If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.
The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.
 JobId  
The identifier for the search job. Use JobId to identify the job in a subsequent call to GetFaceSearch. 
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]$ 
Errors
AccessDeniedException
