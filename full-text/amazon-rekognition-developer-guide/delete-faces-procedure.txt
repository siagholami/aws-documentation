Deleting Faces from a Collection
You can use the DeleteFaces operation to delete faces from a collection. For more information, see Managing Faces in a Collection. 
To delete faces from a collection


If you haven't already:


Create or update an IAM user with AmazonRekognitionFullAccess permissions. For more information, see Step 1: Set Up an AWS Account and Create an IAM User.


Install and configure the AWS CLI and the AWS SDKs. For more information, see Step 2: Set Up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs.


Use the following examples to call the DeleteFaces operation.



[ Java ]
This example deletes a single face from a collection.
Change the value of collectionId to the collection that contains the face that you want to delete. Change the value of faces to the ID of the face that you want to delete. To delete multiple faces, add the face IDs to the faces array.

package aws.example.rekognition.image;
   import com.amazonaws.services.rekognition.AmazonRekognition;
   import com.amazonaws.services.rekognition.AmazonRekognitionClientBuilder;
   import com.amazonaws.services.rekognition.model.DeleteFacesRequest;
   import com.amazonaws.services.rekognition.model.DeleteFacesResult;
import java.util.List;
public class DeleteFacesFromCollection {
      public static final String collectionId = "MyCollection";
      public static final String faces[] = {"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"};
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

     AmazonRekognition rekognitionClient = AmazonRekognitionClientBuilder.defaultClient();


     DeleteFacesRequest deleteFacesRequest = new DeleteFacesRequest()
             .withCollectionId(collectionId)
             .withFaceIds(faces);

     DeleteFacesResult deleteFacesResult=rekognitionClient.deleteFaces(deleteFacesRequest);


     List < String > faceRecords = deleteFacesResult.getDeletedFaces();
     System.out.println(Integer.toString(faceRecords.size())  " face(s) deleted:");
     for (String face: faceRecords) {
        System.out.println("FaceID: "  face);
     }
  }

}
   ```

[ AWS CLI ]
This AWS CLI command displays the JSON output for the delete-faces CLI operation. Replace the value of collection-id with the name of the collection that contains the face you want to delete. Replace the value of face-ids with an array of face IDs that you want to delete.
aws rekognition delete-faces --collection-id "collectionname" --face-ids '["faceid"]'

[ Python ]
This example deletes a single face from a collection.
Change the value of collectionId to the collection that contains the face that you want to delete. Change the value of faces to the ID of the face that you want to delete. To delete multiple faces, add the face IDs to the faces array.

DeleteFaces Operation Request
The input to DeleteFaces is the ID of the collection that contains the faces, and an array of face IDs for the faces to be deleted. 
{
    "CollectionId": "MyCollection",
    "FaceIds": [
        "daf29cac-f910-41e9-851f-6eeb0e08f973"
    ]
}
