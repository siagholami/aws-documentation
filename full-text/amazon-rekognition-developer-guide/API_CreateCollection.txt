CreateCollection
Creates a collection in an AWS Region. You can add faces to the collection using the IndexFaces operation. 
For example, you might create collections, one for each of your application users. A user can then index faces using the IndexFaces operation and persist results in a specific collection. Then, a user can search the collection for faces in the user-specific container. 
When you create a collection, it is associated with the latest version of the face model version.
Note
Collection names are case-sensitive.
This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:CreateCollection action.
