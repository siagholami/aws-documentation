TextDetection
Information about a word or line of text detected by DetectText.
The DetectedText field contains the text that Amazon Rekognition detected in the image. 
Every word and line has an identifier (Id). Each word belongs to a line and has a parent identifier (ParentId) that identifies the line of text in which the word appears. The word Id is also an index for the word within a line of words. 
For more information, see Detecting Text.
