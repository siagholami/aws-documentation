Resiliency in AWS Secrets Manager
AWS builds the global infrastructure around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which connect with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between zones without interruption. Availability Zones allow you to be more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures.
