Deleting Unused Lambda Rotation Functions
After you create a rotation function for a secret, at some point, you might decide you no longer need the secret rotation. . Deleting the secret might be an obvious step. However, you might also want to consider removing the Lambda rotation function that rotates the secret. If you share the rotation function among several secrets, then you don't want to delete the function until you delete the last secret rotated by the function.
If you create the rotation function as described in this guide, by using a AWS Serverless Application Repository template, then you don't simply delete the function. Secrets Manager created the function as part of an AWS CloudFormation stack. Deleting the stack deletes everything the stack created. In this case, Secrets Manager deletes both the Lambda function and the IAM role that grants permissions to the function. You must perform the following steps to delete everything cleanly.
Deleting a rotation function you created with an AWS Serverless Application Repository template
Follow the steps under one of the following tabs:

[ Using the AWS Management Console ]
Minimum permissions
To delete a Lambda rotation function that you created by using one of the AWS Serverless Application Repository templates, you must have the permissions required to navigate to your stack and delete all of the created components:
cloudformation:ListStacks
cloudformation:DescribeStack
cloudformation:ListStackResources
cloudformation:DeleteStack
lambda:ListFunctions
lambda:GetFunction
lambda:DeleteFunction
iam:ListRoles
iam:DetachRolePolicy
iam:DeleteRolePolicy
iam:DeleteRole
cloudformation:DeleteStack
You can grant all of these by attaching the following AWS managed policies:
SecretsManagerReadWrite
IAMFullAccess


Open the AWS Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.


Navigate to the list of functions, and choose the name of the function to delete.


On the function details page, a banner at the top displays This function belongs to the CloudFormation stack *aws-serverless-repository-SecretsManager*. Visit the CloudFormation console to manage this stack.**. 


Choose the CloudFormation console link to open the AWS CloudFormation console on the Stack Details page.


If you added any inline permission policies to the IAM role instead of editing the existing inline policies, or if you attached any additional managed policies, then you must delete or detach those policies before AWS CloudFormation can delete the stack:


Expand the Resources section for the stack, and then choose the Physical ID value for the row, with the Type set to AWS::IAM::Role. This opens the IAM console in a separate tab.


Examine the rows with Inline policy as the Policy type. You should see the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole AWS managed function attached. You should also see one or two inline policies named SecretsManagerPolicy0 and SecretsManagerPolicy1. If you see any policies other than those, Secrets Manager did not create them as part of the stack. The policies were added manually after the stack was created. You must manually delete or detach them. If you don't, the request to delete the stack in the following steps can fail.


Return to the Stack Details page of the AWS CloudFormation console.


Choose Other Actions, and then choose Delete Stack.


On the Delete Stack confirmation dialog box, choose Yes, Delete.


The Status changes to DELETE_IN_PROGRESS. If the deletion successfully completes, the Status eventually changes to DELETE_COMPLETE.

When you return to the list of stacks, you no longer see the deleted stack. 


[ Using the AWS CLI or SDK Operations ]
Minimum permissions
To delete a Lambda rotation function you created by using one of the AWS Serverless Application Repository templates, you must have the permissions required to perform each of the AWS CLI or equivalent API operations listed in the following steps. You can grant all of these by attaching the following two AWS managed policies:
SecretsManagerReadWrite
IAMFullAccess


Open a command prompt to run the AWS CLI commands.


To determine which AWS CloudFormation stack contains a specific function, run the following command with the function name passed as the --physical-resource-id parameter. This returns a list of resources associated with the stack that owns the specified function.


$ aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --physical-resource-id MyLambdaRotationFunction
   {{
       "StackResources": [
           {
               "StackName": "aws-serverless-repository-MyLambdaCreationStack",
               "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stack/aws-serverless-repository-MyLambdaCreationStack/EXAMPLE2-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE",
               "LogicalResourceId": "SecretsManagerRotationTemplate",
               "PhysicalResourceId": "MySecretsManagerRotationFunction",
               "ResourceType": "AWS::Lambda::Function",
               "Timestamp": "2018-04-27T18:03:05.490Z",
               "ResourceStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE"
           },
           {
               "StackName": "aws-serverless-repository-MyLambdaCreationStack",
               "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stack/aws-serverless-repository-MyLambdaCreationStack/EXAMPLE2-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE",
               "LogicalResourceId": "SecretsManagerRotationTemplateRole",
               "PhysicalResourceId": "aws-serverless-repository-SecretsManagerRotationTe-<random-chars>",
               "ResourceType": "AWS::IAM::Role",
               "Timestamp": "2018-04-27T18:03:00.623Z",
               "ResourceStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE"
           }
       ]
   }

Look for the StackId and PhysicalResourceId response values associated with the "ResourceType" :"AWS::IAM::Role", the name of the IAM role with permissions to invoke the function. If you added any inline permission policies to the IAM role instead of editing the existing inline policies, or if you attached any additional managed policies, then you must delete or detach those policies before AWS CloudFormation can delete the stack.

To determine if you have any embedded inline policies, run the following command. 
$ aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <role-name-from-PhysicalResourceId-on-previous-command>
   {
       "PolicyNames": [
           "SecretsManagerRotationTemplateRolePolicy0",
           "SecretsManagerRotationTemplateRolePolicy1"
       ]
   }
The inline policies named as shown here are expected, and you don't need to do anything with them.

If you see any policies listed other than those two, you must delete them from the role before you can proceed.

$ aws iam delete-role-policy --role-name <role-name-from-PhysicalResourceId-on-previous-command> /
          --policy-name <policy-name-from-previous-command>

Now check to see if you have any managed policies attached to the role:

$ aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name <role-name-from-PhysicalResourceId-on-previous-command>

If you see any policies listed at all in the previous command output, run this final preparatory command to detach them from the role:

$ aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name <role-name-from-PhysicalResourceId-on-previous-command> /
          --policy-arn <ARN-of-policy-discovered-in-previous-command>

Now you can delete the stack, which deletes all of the associated resources. Pass the name of the stack you retrieved in step 2 as the --stack-name:

$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name aws-serverless-repository-MyLambdaCreationStack
AWS CloudFormation deletes the IAM role and the Lambda rotation function shortly after you run this command.
