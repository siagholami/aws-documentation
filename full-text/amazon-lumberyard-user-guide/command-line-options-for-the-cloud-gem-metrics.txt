Sending Test Metrics with the Command Line
In addition to using the Metrics Sample level, you can send test metrics to AWS with the command line. Events that are generated with the command line always append to tables with the prefix "dummy_" (for example, "dummy_sessionStart"). This ensures that test events are tagged differently than real world events. 
To send test metrics with the command line


Open a command line window and navigate to the lumberyard_version\dev directory.


Enter the following command to send test metrics. This command sends one test metric.

Enter the following command to send test metrics to simulate three players (threads) and send 500 events for each thread, with a five second delay between each event.
