Placing Lightning Arc

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
When you place a lightning arc entity, you must specify at least one target. The lightning arcs between the lightning arc entity and each target that is linked. The lightning arc appears in Lumberyard Editor when you turn on AI/Physics or enter game mode (Ctrl  G).
To place a lightning arc


In the Rollup Bar, on the Object tab, click Entity.


Under Browser, expand Environment, and then drag LightningArc into your scene.


Under Entity Properties, ensure that Active is selected.


Click AI/Physics in the bottom toolbar. This makes the lightning arc visible in Lumberyard Editor after you place and link the targets.



To place one or more targets, in the Rollup Bar's Objects tab, click AI. Under Object Type, click Tagpoint.


Move your mouse into the scene, and click to place the tag point where your lightning will arc.


To link your tag point, select your lightning arc entity in the scene.


If necessary, scroll down or collapse other headings in the Rollup Bar to find Entity Links. Click Pick Target. Select the tag point you placed. Once it appears in the Link Name list, double-click the link name and change it to Target.


Assign a lightning material: Beneath Entity, click in the Mtl text box. The Material Editor appears.


Expand materials\effects. Right-click the desired lightning effect. Then click Assign to Selected Objects. Close the Material Editor.
