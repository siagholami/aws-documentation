Troubleshooting Skinned Meshes
If your character's skinning appears visually broken in the Animation Editor, the following issues could be why:
 The Coordinate system change modifier isn't identical for the .actor and .motion files
 You might need to reset the bind pose
To change the coordinate system modifier


In Lumberyard Editor, in the Asset Browser, navigate to your .fbx file.


Right-click the .fbx file and choose Edit Settings.


In the FBX Settings window, for the Coordinate system change modifier, set Facing Direction to Do Nothing or Rotate 180 degrees around the up axis.


Ensure your .actor and .motion files use the same Coordinate system change modifier.
