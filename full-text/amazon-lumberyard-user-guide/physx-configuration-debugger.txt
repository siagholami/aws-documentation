Debugger Configuration
In the PhysX Configuration tool, you can specify how to interact with the PhysX Visual Debugger (PVD). The PVD is a third-party application that records your PhysX data from Lumberyard Editor. You can then review this data to see how your physics effects appear.
For more information, see the NVIDIA PhysX Visual Debugger (PVD) documentation.
