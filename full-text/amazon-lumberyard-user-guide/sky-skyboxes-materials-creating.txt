Creating Skybox Materials
Skyboxes in Lumberyard are 5-sided. Sides 1 through 4 are the sides of the box, and side 5 is the top of the box. Skyboxes in Lumberyard do not have a bottom.
The sides of the box are represented by three textures that follow a specific naming convention:


skybox_12.tif


skybox_34.tif


skybox_5.tf


The suffix in the name indicates which sides of the box that the texture is mapped to.
You can use any image editing software to create a skybox texture. We used Adobe Photoshop to create this example and followed these specifications:
 The source sky image is authored at 8192 x 1024.
 The image uses 16 bits per channel to help preserve smooth gradients in the sky. 
 The image is divided into four sections that are 2048 x 1024 each (for illustration purposes).
The numbers represent each side of the skybox that the texture is mapped to. Sides 1 and 2 will become skybox_12.tif and sides 3 and 4 will become skybox_34.tif.

The top of the example sky is a separate texture. The numbers represent which edge of the texture to map to which side. This is important for you to manage texture seams. You must name this 2048 x 2048 texture skybox_5.tif.

When you combine sides 1 and 2 into a single texture (skybox_12.tif), you must flip side 2 horizontally. When you combine sides 3 and 4 into a single texture (skybox_34.tif), you must flip side 4 horizontally. This results in two textures that are 2048 x 2048 each.

To prepare the skybox textures for Lumberyard


Navigate to the directory with your newly created textures.


Right-click each texture and choose RC Open Image.
Note
If you do not see RC Open Image, you must install RC Shell Commands using the Lumberyard Setup Assistant. For more information, see Using Lumberyard Setup Assistant to Set Up Your Development Environment.


In the texture dialog box, under Preset, choose SkyboxHDR from the drop-down list. Click OK. This will create a text file (imagename.exportsettings) that Lumberyard uses to compile the texture correctly.


If you use source control, you must check in all images and .exportsettings files. If you do not check in these files, your scene will not render similarly for each person on your project.
