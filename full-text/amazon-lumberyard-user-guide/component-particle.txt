Particle
You can use the Particle component to place a single particle emitter on an entity. An entity can have multiple Particle components.
Particle Component Properties

The Particle component has the following properties:




Name
Description




Visible
If set, renders the emitter.


Enable
If set, activates the particle effect.


Particle effect library
Specifies the particle effect library. The Particle component uses the effects from an XML file.


Emitters
Select an emitter from the list after specifying a particle effect library. If emitters are not listed, you can create emitters in the Particle Editor.


Color tint
Select the color of the effect with the color swatch.


Pre-Roll
If set, the emitter behaves as though it has been running indefinitely.


Count scale
Sets the multiplier for the particle count. Valid values: 0 to 1000 Default value: 1


Time scale
Sets the multiplier for the emitter time evolution. Valid values: 0 to 1000 Default value: 1


Pulse period
Sets the frequency at which to restart the emitter.  Default value: 1


Global size scale
Sets the multiplier for all effect sizes. Valid values: 1 to 100 Default value: 1


Particle size scale x
Sets the multiplier for the particle size on the x-axis. Valid values: 1 to 100


Particle size scale y
Sets the multiplier for the particle size on the y-axis. Valid values: 1 to 100


Particle size scale z
Sets the multiplier for the particle size on the z-axis. This parameter applies to geometry particles only. For more information, see the Geometry parameter. Valid values: 1 to 100


Particle size scale random
Randomizes the particle size scale. Valid values: 0 to 1


Speed scale
Sets the multiplier for the particle emission speed. Valid values: 1 to 1000


Strength Curve Time
Controls all Strength Over Emitter Life curves. The curves will use this Strength Curve Time parameter instead of the actual emitter lifetime. Negative values are ignored. Valid values: -1 to 1


Ignore rotation
If set, ignores the entity's rotation.


Not attached
If set, ignores the entity's position. The emitter does not follow its entity.


Register by bounding box
If set, uses the bounding box instead of the entity's position to appear in the visible area.


Use LOD
If cleared, ignores the emitter's level of detail (LOD).


Target Entity
Uses the specified target entity for emitters with the Target Attraction parameter or similar features enabled. For more information, see Movement Attribute.


View distance multiplier
Adjusts the maximum view distance. If the value is 1, the default is used. If the value is 1.1, the view distance would be 10% further than the default.  Set the value to 100 for infinite visibility. Valid values: 0 to 100


Use VisAreas
Allow visible areas to control this component's visibility.


Enable audio
If set, enables audio.


Audio RTPC
Select the audio Real-Time Parameter Control (RTPC) that the particle effect instance drives.



EBus Request Bus Interface
Use the following request function with the EBus (event bus) interface to communicate with other components of your game.
For more information, see Working with the Event Bus (EBus) system.

Example
The following script uses the EBus interface.  
function example:OnActivate()
    ParticleComponentRequestBus.Event.Show(self.entityId)
    ParticleComponentRequestBus.Event.Hide(self.entityId)
    ParticleComponentRequestBus.Event.SetVisibility(self.entityId, false)
end
