Using Lumberyard Editor
Lumberyard Editor is your primary workplace for game development. The editor provides access to the tools to create, design, and deploy your game project. You can also play the game to test your changes.
Note
If you receive errors from the AssetProcessor.exe or AssetProcessor_temp.exe, check for the quarantined file in your antivirus software. You can grant exceptions for the affected files.
To open Lumberyard Editor
 After installation, launch Lumberyard Editor with your preferred method:
   From the desktop, double-click the Lumberyard Editor icon. 
Note
The Lumberyard Editor desktop shortcut points to the lumberyard_installation\dev\Bin64vcxxx\Editor.exe file that corresponds to the version of Visual Studio that you chose in Lumberyard Setup Assistant during setup. If you later change the version of Visual Studio that you use with Lumberyard, this desktop shortcut may no longer be valid.
   From Lumberyard Setup Assistant, on the Summary page, click Launch Editor.
   For Visual Studio 2017, navigate to the lumberyard_version\dev\Bin64vc141 directory and double-click Editor.exe.
   For Visual Studio 2019, navigate to the lumberyard_version\dev\Bin64vc142 directory and double-click Editor.exe.
After the first launch and each time you change projects, Asset Processor runs in the background using the project configuration settings to populate the Asset Browser. Messages appear with status information before the editor opens. For more information about Asset Processor, see Using Asset Processor.
