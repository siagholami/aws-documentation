Docking Windows and Toolbars
When you drag a window or toolbar over an interface element or the edges of the editor, docking targets appear to show you where you can dock them. These targets appear for the top, bottom, left, and right quadrants of the pane. You can dock windows relative to any open pane, whether it is already docked, floating as a tab, or split in a column or row.
To split a row or column
To split a row or column, drop the window or toolbar on a docking target.

To dock a window or toolbar as a tab
To dock a window or toolbar as a tab, drop it on the docking target in the middle of a pane.

To dock a window or toolbar to the editor window
To dock a window or toolbar to the editor window, drop it on the outer docking target. This creates a new column next to the existing column.

To undock a window or toolbar
To undock a window or toolbar, drag the title bar and move the selection window away. Avoid the docking targets to prevent from accidentally redocking the window. To help prevent accidental docking, a brief delay occurs before a docking target becomes active. You can also undock a window by right-clicking the title bar and choosing Undock.

To prevent a window from docking
To prevent a window from docking, press and hold Ctrl while moving the window.
To snap windows
To snap a window in place, move the window close to a stationary window. Snapping works on the top, bottom, left, and right borders of the pane.
