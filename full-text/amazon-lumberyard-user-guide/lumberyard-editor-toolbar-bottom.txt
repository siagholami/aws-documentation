Using the Bottom Toolbar
Lumberyard Editor includes a bottom toolbar that provides status as well as the features below.

Status
The status bar (A) displays the number of selected entities and provides functional hints for buttons or menu items in Lumberyard Editor.
Coordinates/Transforms
The coordinates/transform area (B) shows the position of the cursor or the status of a transform, and allows you to enter new transform values. The information in these fields vary based on your tasks:
 When creating an entity or moving the mouse in the viewport, these fields show the cursor location in absolute world coordinates.
 When translating an entity by dragging it in the viewport, these fields show entity's location in absolute world coordinates.
 While transforming an entity, these fields change to spinners in which you can directly type values, or modify by scrolling the mouse wheel.
 While a transform button is active and multiple entities are selected, these fields show the first selection's transform values.
Set Vector
The Set Vector button (C) allows you to set the position, rotation or scale for the selected entities. 
Goto Position
The Goto Position button (D) opens the Go to position dialog box to set a world position and rotation for the perspective view. You can enter floating point coordinates and rotation, or use the spinners to specify values. Clicking the Go To button immediately moves the viewport to the specified coordinates and rotates the view.

Lock Selection
The Lock Selection button (E) toggles selection locking, preventing you from inadvertently selecting something else in a level.
When your selection is locked, you can click or drag the mouse anywhere in the viewport without losing your selection. To deselect or alter your selection, click Lock Selection again to unlock the selection.
Lock Axis Vectors
The Lock Axis Vectors button (F) makes scale operations uniform. 
Speed Control
The Speed button (G) allows you to change the speed of viewport movement. Select a preset speed from the list, enter a value into the field, or use the spinners to adjust the speed up or down.
Terrain Collision
The Enable Terrain Camera Collision button (H) toggles terrain collision to inhibit camera movement below the terrain surface.
Move Player and Camera Separately
The Move Player and Camera Separately button (I) allows the viewport camera to be moved separately from the player entity.
Simulate
The Simulate button (J) toggles physics simulation and AI, allowing you to test physics and AI behavior directly in the editor without entering game mode.
Mute Audio
The Mute Audio button (K) mutes audio in both editor and play mode.
VR Preview
The VR Preview button (L) previews your project in virtual reality mode when a virtual reality gem is enabled.
