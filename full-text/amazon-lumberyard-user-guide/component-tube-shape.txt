Tube Shape

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
Create tube-like volumes along a spline by using the Tube Shape component. To create a tube shape, add the Spline component to an entity to define its shape. In the Tube Shape component, define a radius to control its volume. You can specify a different tube radius at each vertex in the spline.
Note
The Tube Shape component requires the Spline component.

Tube Shape Properties

The Tube Shape component has the following properties.




Name
Description




Visible
The component always appears in the viewport, even if the entity isn't selected.


Game View
Renders the shape in game mode. To enter game mode, press Ctrl  G.


Shape Color
Specifies the color to render the shape.


Radius
The radius of the tube.


Variable Radius
Defines the variable radius at each point along the spline. This value is added to the radius to calculate the final radius of the tube.


Edit
Choose Edit, and the component is locked for editing. For more information, see Editing Components in the Viewport.



EBus Request Bus Interface
You can use the event bus (EBus) interface to communicate with other components in your game. For more information, see Working with the Event Bus (EBus) system.
