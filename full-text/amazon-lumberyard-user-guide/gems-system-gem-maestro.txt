Maestro Gem
The Maestro gem enables Lumberyard's cinematic sequence system. With the cinematic sequence system, you can create cutscenes for your games with the Track View and render them as a series of frames and/or a movie in the editor and during gameplay.

Note
The Maestro gem is required and enabled by default in new Lumberyard projects.
