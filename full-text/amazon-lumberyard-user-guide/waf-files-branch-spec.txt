Waf Branch Spec (waf_branch_spec.py)
The waf_branch_spec.py is the topmost configuration level of the Waf build system. It specifies which operating systems and configurations are available for all projects and specs.
The following is an example waf_branch_spec.py file:
```

Build Layout
BINTEMP_FOLDER = 'BinTemp'

Build Configuration
COMPANY_NAME = 'My Company'
COPYRIGHT = '(c) My Company'

Supported branch platforms/configurations
This is a map of host -> target platforms
PLATFORMS = {
    'darwin' :  [ 'darwin_x64', 'android_armv7_gcc', 'ios' ],
    'win32' :   [ 'win_x64', 'win_x64_vs2012', 'win_x64_vs2010', 'android_armv7_gcc' ],
    'linux' :   [ 'linux_x64_gcc', 'linux_x64_clang' ]
    }
And a list of build configurations to generate for each supported platform
CONFIGURATIONS = [ 'debug',           'profile',           'performance',           'release',
                   'debug_dedicated', 'profile_dedicated', 'performance_dedicated', 'release_dedicated' ]
what conditions do you want a monolithic build ?  Uses the same matching rules as other settings
so it can be platform_configuration, or configuration, or just platform for the keys, and the Value is assumed
false by default.
monolithic builds produce just a statically linked executable with no dlls.
MONOLITHIC_BUILDS = {
        'release' : True,
        'release_dedicated' : True,
        'performance_dedicated' : True,
        'performance' : True,
        'ios' : True
        }
```
The waf_branch_spec.py file manages the following global values:
