LayoutRow
You can use a LayoutRow component to organize child elements into a row. To use this feature, you add the LayoutRow component to an element and then add child elements. The UI system positions the child elements within the row, from left to right or right to left, depending on the order you choose. The child elements can contain a texture or image, a piece of text, a button, a check box, more columns, rows, grids, and so on. To control the sizes of specific, or all, children, add the layout cell component to those children. 
Similar to the LayoutColumn component, the LayoutRow component has an Ignore Default Cell property. For more information, see LayoutColumn.

To see an in-game example of a completed canvas with the Layout Row component, open the level UiFeatures in the project SamplesProject. Press CtrlG to play the game, and then choose Components, Layout Components, Layout Row. You can view examples of different child sizes within a row. Press Esc to exit the game.
To view this same canvas in the UI Editor, navigate to the \Gems\LyShineExamples\Assets\UI\Canvases\LyShineExamples\Comp\Layout directory and open the SimpleRow.uicanvas file.
You can add a prebuilt Layout Row element from the slice library. When you do this, a simple layout row is automatically created and nested in your Hierarchy pane.
To add a Layout Row element from the slice library
 In the UI Editor, choose New, Element from Slice Library, LayoutRow.
To edit a layout row component*
In the Properties pane of the UI Editor, expand LayoutRow and do the following, as appropriate:  
Padding
Type values in pixels, relative to the element's borders.
Spacing
Type values in pixels to adjust spacing between elements.
Order
Select *Left-to-Right or Right-to-Left* to specify the order in which the child elements appear in the row.
Child Alignment
If the layout's children don't occupy all the available layout space, use this setting to determine how the children are aligned.
For *Horizontal, select Left*, Center, or Right to determine how the children are aligned horizontally. 
For Vertical, select Top, Center, or Bottom to determine how the children are aligned vertically.
Ignore Default Cell***
Selected by default, this property causes the layout row to give each child an equal amount of space regardless of their contents (unless the child has a LayoutCell component). The layout row ignores the layout cell's content-based default calculations.
When you clear this option, the layout row uses the children's layout cell calculated values to determine how much space to give each child based on its contents. For more information, see LayoutCell.
