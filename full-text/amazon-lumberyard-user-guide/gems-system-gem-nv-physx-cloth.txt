NVIDIA Cloth Gem

This feature is an experimental release and is subject to change. 

Physical cloth simulations can create more immersive environments and characters. The NVIDIA Cloth Gem uses the NVIDIA Cloth library to provide fast, robust cloth simulation in Amazon Lumberyard.
Note
The NVIDIA Cloth Gem is currently available only for Windows. 
Enable the NVIDIA Cloth Gem
Cloth simulations are created through a familiar, intuitive component that you can add to entities that contain Mesh or Actor components. To make the Cloth component available in Lumberyard, you must build and configure your project with the NVIDIA Cloth Gem enabled.
