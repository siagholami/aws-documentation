Render Synchronous
Regenerates the texture maps for all procedural materials that have pending parameter changes. This update is done synchronously, so that the textures are updated by the time the node completes. In general, use this node in cases where the frame rate isn't a concern and you want to avoid the complexity of the Render Asynchronous node.
Note
If the Set Input  nodes don't modify a procedural material, which means the procedural material doesn't have pending parameter changes, the Render Synchronous node ignores the material.
