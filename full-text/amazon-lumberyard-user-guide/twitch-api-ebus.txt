Twitch C API Reference for Lumberyard
Calls that are made on the TwitchRequestBus return a unique ReceiptID object. Because calls are made asynchronously, responses are not guaranteed to arrive in the same order as requested. Each response type includes a ReceiptID object as a member. To determine which response corresponds to a request, you can compare the ReceiptID instances from the requests to the ReceiptID instances in the responses.
For information about event buses that Lumberyard uses, see Working with the Event Bus (EBus) system.
