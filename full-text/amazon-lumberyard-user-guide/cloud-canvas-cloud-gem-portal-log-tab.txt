Using the Cloud Gem Portal to View Logs

The Cloud Gem Portal (CGP) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Lumberyard. 
You can view Amazon CloudWatch Logs for your cloud gems in the Log tab of the Cloud Gem Portal. CloudWatch Logs is an AWS service that monitors log activity related to your application's use of cloud gems. For example, you can view the Player Account cloud gem logs related to a sign up failure.
CloudWatch Logs arranges logs into log streams and log groups. A log stream is a sequence of log events that share the same source. Each separate source of logs into CloudWatch Logs makes up a separate log stream.
A log group is a group of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. You can define log groups and specify which streams to put into each group. There is no limit on the number of log streams that can belong to one log group. For more information, see Working with Log Groups and Log Streams in the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide.
You can use the Log tab of the Cloud Gem Portal to view log streams and log groups related to your cloud gems.
Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes the following:
 You are using a Lumberyard project that has the Leaderboard and Message of the Day cloud gems enabled.
 You have used Lumberyard's Cloud Canvas Resource Manager or the lmbr_aws command line tool to create a project stack and a deployment stack in AWS.
If you don't meet the prerequisites, follow the steps in Enabling Gems to add cloud gems to your project. For information on creating a project stack and a deployment stack, see Tutorial: Getting Started with Cloud Canvas.
Viewing Log Information in the Cloud Gem Portal
You can view log information from CloudWatch Logs in the Cloud Gem Portal. You can monitor log activity in your AWS account for your cloud gems.

In the Cloud Gem Portal, choose the cloud gem that has the CloudWatch Logs that you want to see. This example uses the Message of the Day cloud gem.



Click the Log tab. You can view summary information for the last 20 minutes of CloudWatch Logs for the cloud gem that you chose. The most recent logs appear at the top of the list.
