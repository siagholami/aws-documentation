Nesting Layout Components
You can nest layout components within other layout components. 
To see an in-game example of a completed canvas with a nested layout, open the level UiFeatures in the project SamplesProject. Press CtrlG to play the game, and then choose Components, Layout Components, Nested Layout. Press Esc to exit the game.
To view that same canvas in the UI Editor, navigate to the \Gems\LyShineExamples\Assets\UI\Canvases\LyShineExamples\Comp\Layout directory and open the \NestedLayout.uicanvas.
The following examples shows one large layout row.

Within the layout row are four columns.

Within column A, there are three layout rows. Column B has two layout grids. Column C has three images. Column D has one large image consisting of a color.

The first image in column C has a layout cell component with a minimum height set at 120. This gives it a larger space than its two siblings below it, which do not have LayoutCelll components. Layout column D also has a LayoutCell component, with a minimum width of 110, giving it more space than the other three columns, which do not have LayoutCell components.
