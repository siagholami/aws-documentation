Adding Grass Manually

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
Although you can paint in your terrain to add grass quickly, the manual approach saves memory and results in better control and a more realistic effect.
To manually add grass


In Lumberyard Editor, click Tools, Material Editor.


Expand the left tree and select a suitable asset.


Under Material Settings, select the Vegetation shader.


Under Shader Generation Params select Grass.


Modify other settings and parameter values for the desired effect. 


Click Assign Object to Item. Close Material Editor.


If necessary, depending on your terrain, in the Rollup Bar, on the Terrain tab, select the AlignToTerrain check box.


Click to place grass in your level and repeat as needed.


Note
When you add or move grass, it may sporadically jump around. This happens if you move vegetation to a location that is too dense to accommodate it. When this occurs, the vegetation moves to its last position and is outlined in red. You can then move it elsewhere or delete it.
