Useful Console Commands
Use the following commands in Lumberyard when working with a network server.
gm_debugdraw debug_draw_level
Sets the debug draw level. Accepts as a parameter a number whos bits represent the flags for the debug data to draw. For example, when set to 1, displays an overlay with GridMate network statistics and information. 
The available bit flags come from the enum DebugDrawBits and are as follows:  
```
enum DebugDrawBits
        {
            Basic           = BIT(0),
            Trace           = BIT(1),
            Stats           = BIT(2),
            Replicas        = BIT(3),
            Actors          = BIT(4),
            EntityDetail    = BIT(5),
        Full            = Basic | Trace | Stats | Replicas | Actors,
        All             = 0xffffffff,
    };

```
gm_disconnectDetection
When set to 0, disables disconnect detection. This is useful when you are debugging a server or client and donâ€™t want to be disconnected when stepping through code. The default value is 1.
gm_dumpstats
Write GridMate network profiling stats to file.
gm_dumpstats_file
 The file to which GridMate profiling stats are written. The default is net_profile.log.
gm_net_simulator
Activate GridMate network simulator to simulate latency, packet loss, bandwidth restrictions, and other conditions. For available options, enter gm_net_simulator help .
gm_setdebugdraw
Display an overlay with detailed GridMate networking statistics and information. A user-friendly helper command for gm_debugdraw debug_draw_level. Possible parameters are Basic, Trace, Stats, Replicas, and Actors.
gm_stats_interval_msec
Set the interval, in milliseconds, for gathering network profiling statistics. The default is 1000.
gm_tracelevel trace_level
Set the GridMate debugging trace verbosity level. The default is 0. The higher the value, the greater the verbosity. Typical values range from 1 to 3.
mpstart [<local_port>]
Starts a LAN session by initializing the network system and optionally setting the local UDP port that initializes the socket. The default port is 64090. To use the ephemeral port, set the port to 0. This is useful if you want to connect to a server on the same computer as the client.
mphost
Create a session as host. The server listens for incoming connections on the port specified in mpstart.
mpjoin [<server_addr>] [<server_port>]
Connect to a server at the optionally specified <server_addr> and <server_port>. The defaults are localhost and 64090, respectively.
map <map_name>
Loads the level with the specified map name. Replace <map_name> with the name of the map you want to use. To view a list of available levels, enter map, and then press the tab key.
mpdisconnect
Terminate the current game instance session.
sv_port local_port
Sets the local UDP port that initializes the socket. The default port is 30090. To use the ephemeral port, set the port to 0. This is useful if you want to connect to a server on the same computer as the client.
