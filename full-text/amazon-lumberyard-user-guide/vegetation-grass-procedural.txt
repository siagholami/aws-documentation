Painting to Add Grass

You can drag the mouse to quickly paint all terrain in your level with grass. This method of placing vegetation is controlled by the texture layer that the vegetation object is associated with. Painted vegetation is visible wherever the texture layer appears. This is a quick way to automatically cover a huge area with grass.
