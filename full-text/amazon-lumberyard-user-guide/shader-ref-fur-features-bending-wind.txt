Wind Bending
Enable the Shader Generation Parameter Wind bending to see the effects of wind on fur's movement. Adjust the shader parameter WindFrequency, WindPhase, and WindScale  to control how the wind affects the fur. The amount of wind applied to the fur is also dependent on the local wind at the entity position as measured by both global wind and wind areas.
