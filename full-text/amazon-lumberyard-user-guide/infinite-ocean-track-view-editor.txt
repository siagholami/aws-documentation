Infinite Ocean Component with the Track View Editor
You can add the Infinite Ocean component to an entity sequence in the Track View. This lets you control the component's parameters to be keyframes and changed along the timeline of the sequence.

Note
Some Infinite Ocean component parameters are not available in the Track View. The Wind Speed and Wind Direction parameters are not supported at this time.
