Adding a Depth of Field Node
You can use the Depth of Field (DOF) node to add realism to scenes to simulate the way a real-world camera works. You can use a broad depth of field to focus on the entire scene, or use a shallow depth of field to have sharp focus only on objects that are a specific distance from the camera.
To add a Depth of Field node in the Track View


In the Track View, right-click the sequence (top node) or the Director node in the tree as applicable, and then choose Add Depth of Field Node.


For each of the keys listed below, click the applicable key listed under the DepthOfField node.


Double-click to position the key on its highlighted row in the timeline.


Double-click the green marker, and under Key Properties, enter a value for Value.
