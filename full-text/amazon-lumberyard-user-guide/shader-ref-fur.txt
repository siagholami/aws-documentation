To use the fur shader, create a new material and, from the Shader drop-down, select Fur. Apply this new material to your mesh object.

You set a Fur Heightmap to define where fur appears, how it clumps together, and to provide non-uniformity of strands across a mesh. A fur heightmap is a grayscale texture, as shown in the following image.

Brighter values at a UV result in longer fur at that point. Under Shader Params, adjust Fur Length (cm) to modify the length of the fur. The following image shows objects with different fur lengths.
