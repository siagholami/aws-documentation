Using Blend Layers for Parallax Mapping
You can use blend layers for parallax mapping. For both POM and OBM, set the diffuse and normal map as usual. The _disp texture will be loaded automatically as long as the Applying Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM) procedure is first completed.
When using a second blend layer, the diffuse map is placed in the Custom texture map slot, the normal map is placed in the [1] Custom slot, and the height map is placed in the SubSurface slot.
To use a blend layer for parallax mapping


Complete the Applying Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM) procedure.


Under Shader Generation Params, select Parallax occlusion mapping and Blendlayer. 


Under Texture Maps, place maps as follows:


Place the height map in Second Height Map.


Place the height map in Second Diffuse Map.


Place the height map in Second Bump Map.


Under Shader Params, adjust the values of the parameters as needed.
