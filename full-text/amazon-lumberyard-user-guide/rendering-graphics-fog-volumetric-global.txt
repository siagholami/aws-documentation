Setting Global (Time of Day) Volumetric Fog
You can use global volumetric fog to simulate particles that are distributed uniformly along the ground and fall off exponentially with height above sea level. Global volumetric fog accurately accounts for time of day lighting and for scattered sunlight rays to produce halos around the sun.
Use the Anisotropy parameters to control the amount of sunlight that is scattered through fog and the direction. Set the Anisotropy (atmosphere) parameter close to 0 to achieve a uniform look across the entire sky. Set the Anisotropy (sun radial) parameter close to 1 to create a bloom effect around the sun.
The Radial blend parameters blend the Anisotropy parameters to create various effects. For example, you can create sun radial scattering by setting Radial blend mode to 1 and Radial blend factor to 1. 
To set global volumetric fog parameters


In Lumberyard Editor, click Tools, Other, Time Of Day.


In the Parameters pane, for Volumetric fog, adjust the Volumetric Fog Parameters as needed.


Close the Time of Day editor.
