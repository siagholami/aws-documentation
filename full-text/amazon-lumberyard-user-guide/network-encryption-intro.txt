Using Encryption
GridMate uses the OpenSSL implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) to support encryption of all UDP traffic sent between clients and servers. 
Limitations
GridMate's implementation of encryption has the following limitations: 
  Only 64-bit Windows is supported. 
  Only client-server topologies are supported. 
Implementation Support
GridMate supports encryption for the following implementations: 
  Server and client authentication 
  Self-signed certificates 
  A single strong OpenSSL cipher 
Cipher
GridMate uses the following single OpenSSL cipher for all encrypted connections: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384. 
This cipher uses the technologies listed in the following table:
