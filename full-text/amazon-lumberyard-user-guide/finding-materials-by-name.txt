Finding the Material Name
You can specify material names to reference for nodes in the Script Canvas editor. The material name is generally the path that starts at the top asset directory but without the .mtl file name extension.
To find the material name


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, Material Editor. 


In the Material Editor, navigate to the material file.


Right-click the material file and choose Copy Path to Clipboard. This copies the path to the file. 
Example 


In the Samples Project, the material name for logo_white.mtl is materials/gettingstartedmaterials/logo_white.
