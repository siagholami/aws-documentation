Portal

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
Use the Portal component to create efficient indoor areas with the VisArea component. You can use portals to specify areas where you can look out of a visible area and see beyond it, such as windows or doors between visible areas.
To use the Portal component, its volume must overlap at least two or more visible areas.
Note
You can't modify the OccluderArea, Portal, and VisArea components at runtime.

Portal Component Examples
Example 1
In the following examples, two boxes are inside several visible areas. The visible areas are connected by the portals, which are green. The portal lets you see between the visible areas. The shadows of the boxes inside the visible areas appear because the AffectedBySun option is enabled.  

Example 2
The following example shows how the portal lets you see between two visible areas. Although the boxes are in separate visible areas, the portal creates a window between them so that you can see both boxes.  

Example 3
In the following example, you see the portal at an angle. You can't see the box in the other visible area because there is no portal in that line of sight.  

Example 4
In the following example, you can see a box through a different portal, but because the DoubleSide option is disabled, the portal is one-sided.  

Example 5
In the following example, if you go through the portal and look back, you can see the other visible areas, but you can't see the boxes in those areas. You can't see through portals that aren't connected to the visible area that you're in.
