Adding Audio and Sound Effects
Lumberyard uses an audio translation layer (ATL) to interface between Lumberyard and third-party audio middleware, so you can develop and change your audio implementation without affecting the game logic. The game logic interacts with ATL controls, which map to their audio middleware equivalents through the Audio Controls Editor. For example, to play a sound, the game executes an ATL trigger, which is mapped to a 'Play' event in the audio middleware.
Lumberyard supports Audiokinetic Wave Works Interactive Sound Engine (Wwise), an audio pipeline solution with which you can create compelling soundscapes for your game. Lumberyard comes pre-configured with Wwise LTX, a free, compact version of Wwise. 
For more information, see Setting up Wwise LTX.
Wwise is an industry standard audio middleware, but the full-featured software is not free. For licensing and pricing details, see http://www.audiokinetic.com/pricing.
