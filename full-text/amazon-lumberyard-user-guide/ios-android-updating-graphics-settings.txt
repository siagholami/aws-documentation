When you choose a graphics performance setting, the r_GraphicsQuality console variable automatically updates with a corresponding value:
 Very High: 4
 High: 3
 Medium: 2
 Low: 1
You can change the default value for the r_GraphicsQuality console variable in each OS configuration file. You can find the files in the lumberyard_version\dev\Cache\game_project\pc directory.

The following is an example of the system_ios_ios.cfg file.  

If you set r_GraphicsQuality to 0, the graphics performance setting is automatically detected based on the mobile device model or total RAM. You can review the mapping for mobile device models and graphics performance settings in the android_models.xml and ios_models.xml files, located in the lumberyard_version\dev\Cache\game_project\pc\game_project\config directory.
