Displacement Mapping Best Practices
For best results, use the following best practices when creating displacement maps.
Content Creation Practices
 Place the displacement map in the alpha channel of your texture. The RGB values are not used for this map type and can be left empty.
 Use the suffix _displ. For example, road.tif would be road_displ.tif. 
Game Implementation Practices in Lumberyard
 In Lumberyard Editor, set the performance to High or Very High for your target platform. 
To set the graphics performance for your target platform


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Edit, Editor Settings, Graphics Performance.


Select your platform and then select the performance setting.
 The console variable e_ShadowsTessellateCascades=1 enables shadows for tessellated geometry. Use this console variable sparingly, as this feature increases performance costs.
 Use the Displacement Map preset to store _displ textures. Height maps are converted to A8 textures. If you don't see any displacement, open the texture file in the Material Editor and verify the rendering in preview. If the file isn't in A8 format, fix the preset, save, and reload.
 In the Material Editor, under Shader Generation Params, select the Displacement mapping parameter. Under Texture Maps, for the Height Map parameter, assign the displacement map.
