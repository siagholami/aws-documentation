Creating the River Entity

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
After you have prepared the riverbed, you next create and place the River entity.
When performing this procedure, you may notice that parts of the river disappear into the terrain. The Align Height Map step resolves this by stretching the terrain height to match the path of the river based on its shape and on BorderWidth parameter. For information on BorderWidth and related settings, see River Entity.

To create and place the River entity


In the Rollup Bar, on the Objects tab, click Misc, River.


In your level, starting at the beginning of the river bed, click to place a series of points that define the riverâ€™s path.


When complete, double-click at the end of the river bed.


In the Rollup Bar, under River Parameters, click Align Height Map to adjust the terrain height to match the path of the river.
