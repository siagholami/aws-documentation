Emitter Attribute
In the Emitter attribute, specify how to control the location and spawning attributes of the particle and emitter shape. The parameters are updated based on the type that you select. 

Emitter Attribute Parameters 



Name
Description




Particle Type
Specifies whether the emitter is a CPU or GPU type.


Emitter Shape Type
Specifies the emitter shape type.[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Relative Particle Movement
Determines the particle motion in the emitter's space. The following is an example of particles that are emitted upward from an emitter: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]Default value: No


Parameter Inheritance
Specifies the source for default (starting) effect parameters. [See the AWS documentation website for more details]The selected source has the following consequences:[See the AWS documentation website for more details]To reset parameters to the default values that are located in the DefaultParticleEmitters.xml file, right-click the parameter and choose Reset to default. You can modify the default values for the project using the same file. When you save effects to .xml libraries, only non-default values are saved. When you load effects from the .xml libraries, the current default values for the effect's inheritance are used as a base.When you edit a parent effect's parameters, the non-edited parameters of all children (and descendants) that have Parent selected are instantly updated.


Spawn Indirection
This parameter has the following values: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]  This parameter is supported only within the same CPU or GPU particle type.


Attach Type
Specifies the emission location when the parent emitter has geometry.[See the AWS documentation website for more details]Default value: None


Attach Form
Specifies the elements of the geometry from which particles emit.[See the AWS documentation website for more details]Default value: Vertices


Count
Specifies the total number of particles that are active at a given time and determines the emission rate (Count/Particle Lifetime). You can set a Random value and the Strength Over Emitter Life curve. Valid values: 0


Maintain Density
Increases the emission rate (and particle count) when an emitter moves in order to maintain the same spatial density as when motionless. You can scale the increase from 0 to 1. [See the AWS documentation website for more details]Valid values: 0


Continuous
If false, emits all particles at once and then dies. If true, emits particles gradually over the emitter lifetime. If true and Emitter Lifetime = 0, emits particles gradually at a rate of Count/Particle Lifetime per second, indefinitely. Default value: false


Spawn Delay
Delays the start of the emitter for the specified time. This is useful to delay subeffects relative to the overall emitter creation time. Can set a Random value.Valid values: 0Default value: 0


Emitter Lifetime
If Continuous = true, specifies the lifetime of the emitter. Emitter lifetime does not apply to noncontinuous effects, which always disappear as soon as they have emitted all of their particles. You can set a Random value.Valid values: 0Default value: 0 (infinite lifetime)


Pulse Period
If greater than 0 and Continuous = false, restarts the emitter repeatedly at this interval. You can set a Random value.Valid values: anyDefault value: 0


Orient to Velocity
Forces the particle x-axis to align to the velocity direction. You can use Rotation parameters to rotate the particle further. Default value: false


Position Offset
XYZ values define the spawning position away from the emitter itself in emitter space. Valid values: any Default values: 0, 0, 0


Random Offset
XYZ values define the range of a random spawning box in both directions, away from the position offset. Valid values: any Default values: 0, 0, 0


Offset Roundness
Specifies the fraction of spawning volume corners to round. Valid values: 0 (box shape) to 1 (ellipsoid shape)Default value: 0


Offset Inner Fraction
Specifies the ratio of inner to outer spawning volume. Valid values: 0 (spawn within entire volume) to 1 (spawn only at surface)Default value: 0
