Starting Point Input Gem
The Starting Point Input gem works with the Input Management Framework gem to map low-level input events to high-level gameplay actions. For example, you can specify in your game that pressing the keyboard spacebar results in a gameplay action, such as jump. 

For information about working with input events, see the Input component.
For information about working with input gestures such as touch, swipe, and rotate, see the Gestures gem.
