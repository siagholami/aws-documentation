Using Lumberyard Networking
Lumberyard's GridMate networking system is designed for efficient bandwidth usage and low-latency communications. You can synchronize objects over the network with GridMate's replica framework. GridMate's session management integrates with major online console services and lets you handle peer-to-peer and client-server topologies with host migration. GridMate also supports in-game achievements, leaderboards, and cloud-based saved games through third-party social services such as Steam. For an example of how to set up a multiplayer project, see Multiplayer Sample.
This section discusses the various components of, and setup requirements for, your Amazon Lumberyard game networking environment. For information about a diagnostic tool for networking, see Profiler.
