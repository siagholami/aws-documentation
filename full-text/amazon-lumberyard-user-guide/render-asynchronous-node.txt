Render Asynchronous
Schedules all procedural materials that have pending parameter changes to regenerate their texture maps. This update is done asynchronously, so that the textures are updated within a few frames. Use this node (instead of the Render Synchronous node) for changes made during gameplay.
The node returns a Render ID, which you can use with the On Render Finished node to detect when the textures finish updating. This should only be necessary if you need to synchronize another action with the texture update.
If the Force parameter is disabled, the node renders only procedural materials that are not currently rendering. Use this option when updating procedural materials every frame. Otherwise, the render queue can back up and may not catch up. 
When the Force parameter is enabled, the node is guaranteed to render the changes. Use this option to make only occasional updates to the procedural material, or if you previously updated the procedural material every frame and you want a final update to guarantee that the update is not missed.
For an example script with the Render Asynchronous node, see the example script.
Note
If the Set Input  nodes don't modify a procedural material, which means the procedural material doesn't have pending parameter changes, the Render Asynchronous node ignores the material.
