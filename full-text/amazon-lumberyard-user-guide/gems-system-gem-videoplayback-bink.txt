Video Playback Bink Gem
With the Video Playback Bink gem, you can play videos using RAD Game Tools' Bink video codec. The videos are playable in a game or level loading screen, or on textures in your Lumberyard level. When you enable the Video Playback Bink gem, the Video Playback Bink component is enabled. For instructions on how to prepare Lumberyard for video playback, and how to set up video playback in your level, see Video Playback Bink.
For more information on playing videos in load screens, see Defining Game and Level Load Screens.
