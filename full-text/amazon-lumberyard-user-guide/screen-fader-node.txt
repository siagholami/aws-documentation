Screen Fader
Controls fading the screen to a color and/or a texture. You can use this node to script cinematic transitions, such as fading to black or fading to a loading screen texture. The fade is a screen overlay that is rendered on top of the scene. The size and position of this overlay can be adjusted to a different size than full screen. This is useful if you want to draw letter boxes at the top and bottom of the screen. If you use custom positioning with a texture, you can use this node as a quick way to draw decorative borders around the frame.
To use the Screen Fader node in the Track View, see Screen Fader Node.

Description




Fade Out
Event
Triggers fading out to a color or texture.

Fade In Time
Number
Number of seconds when fading in.


Fade Out Time

Color
Color
The color to fade to and from. The alpha channel is ignored.The use of this property depends on the value of Use Current Color, and whether you are fading in or fading out.


Use Current Color
Boolean
Specify true to continue to use the current color for the fade overlay. The use of the Color property depends on the value of Use Current Color, and whether you are fading in or fading out. Current Color is the color that is rendered by the fader, including the alpha channel. This is generally whatever color is left over from prior fading activity. The Color Property Behavior table in the next section shows the color values that are blended to create the fading transition.


Texture Name
String
(Optional) The name of a texture from or to which to fade. To use only solid colors for fading, leave this value empty.  For more information, see Finding the Texture Name.


Update Always
Boolean

Vector4
Sets the screen coordinates (left, top, right, and bottom) where the fade overlay is drawn. The default is full screen (0, 0, 1, 1).
