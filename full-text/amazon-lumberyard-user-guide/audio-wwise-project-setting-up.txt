Creating a Wwise Project
To create a Wwise project


From the Start menu, open Wwise Launcher.


On the WWISE tab, click Launch Wwise (64-bit).
Note
If you have multiple versions of Wwise installed, open the version that you installed for Lumberyard.


In the Project Launcher dialog, click New.


In the New Project dialog, enter a Name for the project.
Note
Wwise uses the name of your project to create a directory with the same name. However, you later rename the directory wwise_project.


For the Location, select the lumberyard_version\dev\game_project\Sounds directory. If this directory doesn't exist, create it.


Review and adjust the remainder of the options and then click OK.


If you are using the full version of Wwise, the License Manager dialog appears. Paste or import your license key if you have one and click Save. 


If you don't have your license key, click Close. 


Exit Wwise.


In a file explorer, navigate to the lumberyard_version\dev\game_project\Sounds directory.


Rename the project directory you created in step 4 to wwise_project.


Create another directory next to wwise_project called wwise, if it doesn't exist already. This is where your Wwise soundbanks will be generated.


Open Wwise again.


Click Open Other.


Navigate to the lumberyard_version\dev\game_project\Sounds\wwise_project directory.


Select the .wproj file and click Open.


Generating New Soundbanks
To generate new soundbanks


If the Wwise project is not currently open, open it.


Choose Project, Project Settings.


On SoundBanks tab, in the SoundBank Paths section, edit the SoundBank Folder and select the wwise directory that you created in Creating a Wwise Project and then click OK.


If you are using Wwise LTX, click Generate Soundbank.


If you are using the Wwise full version:


Press F7 to open the SoundBank Manager Layout.


If no soundbanks exist, you must create one.
To create a soundbank, select all SoundBanks, Platforms, and Languages.


Click Generate.


Ensure that the soundbank generation succeeded. To do this, navigate to the lumberyard_version\dev\game_project\Sounds\wwise directory and verify that you have an Init.bnk file and other .bnk or .wem files.


For information on how to map soundbanks to ATL preloads so that Lumberyard can load them, see Using the Audio Controls Editor.
Creating Wwise Events for the Default ATL Controls
To create Wwise events for the default ATL controls


If the Wwise project is not currently open, open it.


Select the Events tab.


Under the Default Work Unit, select or create a directory to contain default ATL controls.


Right-click the directory to display the context menu and choose New Child, Empty Event.


Create five empty events named the following:
    do_nothing
    get_focus
    lose_focus
    mute_all
    unmute_all
Note
The get_focus and unmute_all events unmute the Master Audio Bus.
The lose_focus and mute_all events mute the Master Audio Bus.


Save the project.


Generate soundbanks.


In Lumberyard Editor, open the Audio Controls Editor.


Map these Wwise events to the default ATL controls.


Click File, Save All.
