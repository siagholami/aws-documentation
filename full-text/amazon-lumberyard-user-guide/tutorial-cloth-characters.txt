Create Cloth for Characters

This feature is an experimental release and is subject to change. 
To use Cloth, you must enable the NVIDIA Cloth Gem. For more information, see the NVIDIA Cloth Gem documentation. 
Cloth Assets for Characters
You can create character cloth assets in the DCC application of your choice and import them into Lumberyard from an FBX file. The character asset should have the following: 
 Body mesh 
   A visual representation of the character, skinned to the skeleton, that doesn't include cloth. 
 Cloth mesh 
   This is the cloth mesh that is going to be rendered and simulated in Lumberyard. 
   The cloth mesh must be skinned. The joints don't have to be exclusive for the cloth mesh. Because the mesh will have a cloth simulation, we recommend that few joints be added to keyframe animate cloth meshes. 
   This cloth mesh should have vertex color information, which you can create with a vertex painting tool in your DCC application. The Cloth component will use the red channel of the vertex color. 
     A zero value in the red channel means the vertex will not be affected by cloth simulation. The vertex will be static. 
     Any other value in the red channel represents the invert mass of the vertex, and the vertex will be affected by cloth simulation. For example, a value of 0.3 in the red channel means the vertex has a mass value of 3.33 (from 1.0/0.3). The smaller (darker) the value, the greater the mass. 
 Skeleton 
   Joints for the character and cloth. 
   (Optional) Cloth mesh can have its own joints, or use any joints of the skeleton. 
 Animation 
   The entire skeleton can be animated, including cloth joints. 
   Key framed cloth animation on joints can be blended with simulated cloth animation at runtime. 
Note
A sample character cloth asset is located in the NVIDIA Cloth Gem directory located at \dev\Gems\``NvCloth/Assets/Objects/cloth/Chicken/. 
Add Cloth to Character Assets
Create cloth by adding the Cloth component to an entity that has an Actor component and setting the properties of the Cloth component. 


In Lumberyard Editor, add a new entity to the level. 


Add an Actor component and reference the actor asset and material. 


(Optional) Add an Anim Graph component and reference the actor anim graph asset and motion set. 


Add a Cloth component to the entity. 


Set the cloth data of the mesh asset. 


Click the button beside the Mesh node property to open the FBX Settings window. 



In the FBX Settings window, on the Actors tab, choose Add Modifier, Cloth. 


In the Cloth modifier area: 


Select the cloth mesh from the drop-down list. 


Select the vertex color stream that includes the invert masses. If a vertex color stream is not provided, cloth defaults to invert mass 1.0 for all vertices. 





Choose the Update button. Asset Processor then updates the asset and including the cloth data. For more information, see Editing the FBX Settings. 


Configure the cloth component. 


Select the cloth mesh node from the drop-down list. 



Adjust cloth properties to obtain the desired cloth behavior. For more information, see Cloth Component. 


You can use the property Animation Blending to blend between cloth simulation and skinned animation.

In Lumberyard Editor, press CtrlG or press the Play button to run your project.
