Best Practices for Volumetric Fog
See the following best practices for working with volumetric fog.
 Attach a Fog Volume and a Box Shape component to the entity.
 Set the r_DeferredShadingTiled console variable to a value greater than 0. The recommended value is 1 to 2. This is required to use volumetric fog. For more information, see Using the Console Window.
 To avoid performance problems, use the default values for the Ramp Start and Ramp End parameters located in the Time of Day editor. For more information, see Setting Global (Time of Day) Volumetric Fog. 
 In the Time of Day Editor, large values for the Range parameter can cause fog flicker and light leaking behind walls. 
To correct this effect, you can adjust the value for the r_VolumetricFogTexDepth console variable accordingly.
Example 
The default value for the r_VolumetricFogTexDepth console variable is 32 and the default value for Range is 64. If you want to use a larger range such as Range=256 and maintain the same visual quality, you need to set r_VolumetricFogTexDepth to 64. 
When Range is 1024, set r_VolumetricFogTexDepth to 128.
