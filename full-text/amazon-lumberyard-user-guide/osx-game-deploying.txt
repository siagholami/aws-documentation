Running macOS Games

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
Before you can run your game on a macOS computer, you must ensure the shader compiler (located in the lumberyard_version\dev\Tools\CrySCompileServer\x64\profile directory) is running on your PC. For more information, see Building Shaders for macOS Games.
To run your game on a macOS computer


Open the Xcode solution that you generated (located in the Solutions folder in the directory where you installed Lumberyard).


Build, run, and debug your application as you would any Xcode project. For information, see Launching Your Mac App.


(Optional) Load different levels by doing one of the following:
    Open the console window using the tilde (\~) key, and then enter map <name of map or level to load>. The console supports tab completion, so you can press Tab after the map command to see the list of supported levels and maps to load.
    Edit the autoexec.cfg file for your game to change the map command to load a different map or level. Run the game from Xcode again.
For example, if you are using the Samples Project, edit the autoexec.cfg file located in the /dev/SamplesProject directory. macOS supports the Advanced_RinLocomotion level.


Use the following controls to navigate around your game:
    Switch between cameras by selecting the buttons in the lower right corner of the screen.
    Move Rin in the Character Controller view by using the mouse or keyboard (WASD).
    Jump in the Character Controller view by pressing the Space key.
