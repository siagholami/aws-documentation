Adding Ocean Wind

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
You can simulate realistic wind and wave effects for the ocean in your level.
To set ocean wind parameters


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, Rollup Bar.


In the Rollup Bar, on the Terrain tab, under Terrain, click Environment.


Under OceanAnimation, adjust the following parameters:
    Wind Direction – Specifies the direction to push the water texture crawl in radians. Valid values: 0.0 to 6.28.
    Wind Speed – Specifies how frequently the texture water crawl updates.
    Wave Frequency – Sets the frequency of waves. Smaller values mean fewer, longer waves (deep ocean depth). Larger values mean more, shorter waves (shallow ocean depth).
    Wave Height – Sets wave height in meters by means of vertex displacement.
