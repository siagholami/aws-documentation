Saving the Vegetation Area as a Slice
Save your vegetation area as a slice so that you can easily place it in other locations or levels and further customize it.
Slices enable you to place multiple instances of the vegetation for your level. If you make a change to a slice, you can save the override to all other instances of the slice. For example, if you change the vegetation asset type from red to yellow flowers, you can choose to update all instances of the slice so that the vegetation area appears with yellow flowers.
For more information, see Working with Slices.
To reference vegetation using slices


In the Entity Inspector, select the BasicCoverage entity.


Right-click the entity and choose Create slice, enter a name such as BasicCoverage.slice, and save it to a directory.


In the Asset Browser, navigate to the BasicCoverage.slice file.


Select and drag the file into the viewport. This creates an instance of the slice.
Example 


Two slice instances in the viewport have the same vegetation assets and configuration.



Select the new instance of the BasicCoverage entity.


On the Vegetation Asset List component, click the Mesh Asset and select a yellow flower asset. 

Note
A property that appears orange has an override. An override is a component change that is different than its source slice. For more information, see Modifying a Slice and Saving Changes.


Right-click the property, choose Save field override, and choose basiccoverage.slice. 


This updates all instances of the slice to use yellow flowers.
