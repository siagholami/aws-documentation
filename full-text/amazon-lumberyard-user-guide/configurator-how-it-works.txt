Understanding the Project Configurator

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
The Project Configurator is an application for specifying the settings that affect building and editing of your game project. When you work with the Project Configurator, note the following changes.
Topics
 Set Default (Active) Project
 Create a New Project
 Enable or Disable Gems
 Create a New Gem
Set Default (Active) Project
When you set the default (active) project, the Project Configurator modifies the following files with the following information:
lumberyard_version\dev\bootstrap.cfg
The sys_game_folder property specifies the project that the editor and PC launcher attempts to load (for example, sys_game_folder=SamplesProject).
lumberyard_version\dev\_WAF_\user_settings.options
The property enabled_game_projects is a comma-separated list of one or more projects to include in a build.
Create a New Project
When you create a new project in the Project Configurator, several things happen:
 The Project Configurator uses the EmptyTemplate to create a new project. This template is located in the lumberyard_version\dev\ProjectTemplates\EmptyTemplate directory.
 The contents of lumberyard_version\dev\ProjectTemplates\EmptyTemplate\code\EmptyTemplate are copied to the following directory:
lumberyard_version\dev\code\NewProjectName
 The contents of lumberyard_version\dev\ProjectTemplates\EmptyTemplate are copied to the following directory:
lumberyard_version\dev\NewProjectName
 The EmptyTemplate is replaced in both new directories with the name of your new project, including file names and file contents.
For more information about templates, see Project Templates.
Enable or Disable Gems
When you enable or disable a gem in a project, the Project Configurator updates the list of enabled gems that is maintained in lumberyard_version\dev\Game_Project\gems.json. 
For more information, see Enabling Gems.
 Enabling a gem adds that gem name to the list in gems.json.
 Disabling a gem removes that gem name from the list in gems.json. 
 Enabling or disabling a gem updates the Editor.xml and Game.xml files. You can find these files in the lumberyard_version\dev\Game_Project\Config directory. These files tell Lumberyard to load the required .dll files for the gems that you specify.
Note
The Editor.xml and Game.xml files are only updated when you enable or disable gems where "LinkType":"Dynamic" in the gem.json file. For more information, see Gem JSON File.
Create a New Gem
When you use the Project Configurator to create a gem, the following takes place:
 The content of the gem template (which is part of the Project Configurator resources and is not directly accessible) is copied into the lumberyard_version\dev\Gems\Gem_Name directory.
 Strings with the gem name in the copied content are replaced with the name of your gem to make it a valid gem.
For more information, see Creating a Gem.
