Adding Vegetation Bending Effects
Lumberyard provides three methods for adding realistic bending motions to vegetation:
 Touch (Collision) Bending – bending effects for larger vegetation caused by players brushing against or colliding with branches 
 Detail (Wind) Bending – physically accurate wind effects for larger vegetation defined by using vertex colors and environment wind parameters
 Automerged (Wind) Bending – physically accurate wind effects for grass defined by vegetation and environment wind parameters
You can use touch and detail bending effects together. For example, a player can brush against a branch that is also swaying in the breeze. Use automerged bending by itself for objects like grass.
From a performance standpoint, detail bending is the least expensive, touch bending is more expensive, and automerged bending is the most expensive.
