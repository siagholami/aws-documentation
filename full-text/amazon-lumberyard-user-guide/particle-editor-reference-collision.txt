Collision Attribute
In the Collision attribute, specify how to control the particle's physical setup.

CPU Collision Attribute Parameters 



Name
Description




Physics Type
Specifies how the particle interacts physically. [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Collide Terrain
Includes terrain in particle collisions. Default value: false


Collide Static Objects
Includes non-terrain, static objects in particle collisions. This is expensive. Default value: false


Collide Dynamic Objects
Includes non-terrain, dynamic objects in particle collisions. This is expensive. Default value: false


On Collide
Upon impact with the static environment, the particle dies. [See the AWS documentation website for more details]Default value: Die


Max Collision Events
Limits the number of collisions that the particle can have in its physics simulation. This affects only particles that have Physics Type set to Rigid Body. Valid values: 0 to 255Default value: 0


Bounciness
Controls the elasticity for collision response. This affects only particles that have Physics Type set to Simple Collision. You can override this feature by setting Surface Type. You can also use a special value of –1 to have the particle die on first collision. Valid values: anyDefault value: 0


Collision Fraction
Determines the fraction of emitted particles that perform collisions. Valid values: 0 to 1Default value: 1


Collision Cutoff Distance
Specifies the maximum distance from the camera at which collisions are performed. A value of 0 means infinite. Valid values: 0Default value: 0


Surface Type
Selects from a variety of surface material types for the collision behavior. If set, Surface Type overrides Bounciness and Dynamic Friction. Default value: none


Dynamic Friction
The coefficient of dynamic friction. If set, Surface Type overrides Dynamic Friction. This affects only particles that have Physics Type set to Simple Collision. Valid values: 0Default value: 1


Thickness
Controls the fraction of the particle's visible radius to use for the physical radius. This affects particles that have Physics Type set to Simple Physics and geometry particles that have Physics Type set to Simple Collision. Valid values: 0Default value: 1


Density
Controls the particle density in kg/m^3. An example of a physically correct value is Water = 1000. This affects only particles that have Physics Type set to Simple Physics or Rigid Body. Valid values: 0Default value: 1000

Thickness
Controls the fraction of the particle's visible radius to use for the physical radius. This affects particles that have Physics Type set to Simple Physics.Valid values: 0Default value: 1
