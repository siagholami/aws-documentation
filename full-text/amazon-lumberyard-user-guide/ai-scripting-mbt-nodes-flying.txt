Flying Nodes

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
These nodes provide MBT functionality related to flying vehicles.
Hover
Causes a flying AI agent to hover at its current position.
Parameters
None.
Success/Failure
The node does not SUCCEED or FAIL. Once executed, it continues running until forced to terminate.
Example
<Hover />
FlyShoot
Allows the AI agent to shoot at its attention target when possible from its current position.
If the AI agent's secondary weapon system is used, the node will only open fire if the weapons are able to hit close enough to the target. Otherwise normal firing rules are applied.
Parameters
useSecondaryWeapon
Boolean indicating whether or not the secondary weapon system (such as rocket launchers) should be used. Default is 0.
Success/Failure
The node does not SUCCEED or FAIL. Once executed, the AI agent continues to shoot until forced to terminate.
Example
<FlyShoot useSecondaryWeapon="1" />
WaitAlignedWithAttentionTarget
Waits until the AI agent is facing its attention target.
Parameters
toleranceDegrees
Maximum angle (in degrees) between the attention target and the forward direction of the AI agent to consider the AI agent to be "facing" the attention target. Allowed values include the range [0.0,180.0]. Default is 20.0. 
Success/Failure
The node SUCCEEDS if the angle between the AI agent's forward direction and its attention target is within the allowed range. The node FAILS if the AI agent has no attention target.
Example
<WaitAlignedWithAttentionTarget toleranceDegrees="40" />
Fly
Allows an AI agent to fly around by following a path.  
Parameters
desiredSpeed
Speed of movement (in meters per second) along the path to move along the path. Default is 15.0.
pathRadius
Radius of the path (in meters). While flying, the AI agent tries to stay within this distance from the path's line segments. Defaults is 1.0. 
lookAheadDistance
Distance (in meters) to look forward along the path for 'attractor points' to fly to. Default is 3.0. 
decelerateDistance
Distance (in meters) from the end of the path that the AI agent starts to decelerate. Default is 10.0. 
maxStartDistanceAlongNonLoopingPath
Maximum distance (in meters) to look ahead for the closest point to link with another path. This parameter is used to link with non-looping paths; for example, it is useful to prevent the AI agent from snapping to the new path at a position that seems closer but is actually behind a wall after a U-turn. Defaults is 30.0. 
loopAlongPath
Boolean indicating whether or not the AI agent should follow a path in an endless loop. Default is 0. 
startPathFromClosestLocation
Boolean indicating at what point the AI agent should start following a path. Default is 0.
 1 - at its closest position
 2 - at the first path waypoint
pathEndDistance
Distance (in meters) from the end of the path that this node should start sending arrival notification events. Defaults is 1.0. 
goToRefPoint
Boolean indicating whether or not the current reference point should be appended to the end of the path. Default is 0.
Success/Failure
The node SUCCEEDS if the AI agent reached the end of the path. The node FAILS if no valid path was assigned to the AI agent.
Example
<Fly lookaheadDistance="25.0" pathRadius="10.0" decelerateDistance="20.0" pathEndDistance="1" desiredSpeed="15" maxStartDistanceAlongNonLoopingPath="30" loopAlongPath="0" goToRefPoint="1" startPathFromClosestLocation="1" />
Lua table settings
The following properties in the AI agent's Lua script table can override the default XML tags. This will allow for changes to be made at runtime through scripting.

Each node tick
Helicopter_Speed

Helicopter_Loop

Node activation
Helicopter_StartFromClosestLocation

Upon arrival, the following events will be emitted: 
 ArrivedCloseToPathEnd
 ArrivedAtPathEnd
FlyForceAttentionTarget
Keeps an attention target on a flying vehicle by force. The attention target is acquired during each tick of the node from the Helicopter_ForcedTargetId Lua script variable. When the node is deactivated, a ForceAttentionTargetFinished event is emitted. 
Parameters
None. 
Success/Failure
The node does not SUCCEED or FAIL. Once executed, it continues to force the attention target until deactivation.
Example
<FlyForceAttentionTarget />
FlyAimAtCombatTarget
Aims a flying AI agent at its target, taking into account special aiming adjustments for weapons.
Parameters
None. 
Success/Failure
The node does not SUCCEED or FAIL. Once executed, it continues to force the AI agent to rotate its body towards the attention target until termination. 
Example
<FlyAimAtCombatTarget />
HeavyShootMortar
Controls shooting the mortar (or Heavy X-Pak) weapon. It tries to simplify and centralize the pre-condition check and initialization of the weapon, plus re-selection of the primary weapon.
Parameters
to
(Optional) Shooting target. Allowed values include: 
 Target (default)
 Refpoint
fireMode
(Optional) Type of firing. Allowed values include: 
 Charge (default)
 BurstMortar
timeout
(Optional) Maximum time (in seconds) to continue shooting. Default is 5.0.
aimingTimeBeforeShooting
(Optional) Time (in seconds) to spend aiming before starting to shoot. Value must be longer than the global timeout. Default is 1.0. 
minAllowedDistanceFromTarget
(Optional) Minimum distance (in meters) to the target required to start shooting. Default is 10.0.
Success/Failure
The node FAILS if the weapon is closer to the target than the value of minAllowedDistanceFromTarget. The node FAILS if there are obstructions less than two meters in front of the weapon; a cylinder check is done to avoid this. The node FAILS if the timeout is reached. The node SUCCEEDS if the shooting SUCCEEDS.
Example
<HeavyShootMortar to="RefPoint" fireMode="Charge" aimingTimeBeforeShooting="2" timeout="7" />
SquadScope
Makes execution of a child node conditional on adding the AI agent to a squad scope. Squads allow a limited number of concurrent users. 
Note
The dynamic squad system uses the AI system's cluster detector. This tool is used with AISquadManager to group AI agents into dynamic squads.
Parameters
name
Name of the squad scope to enter.
allowedConcurrentUsers
(Optional) Maximum number of simultaneous users allowed in the specified squad scope. Default is 1.
Success/Failure
The node SUCCEEDS when the child SUCCEEDS. The node FAILS if the AI agent can't enter the squad scope or if the child FAILS.
Example
<SquadScope name="SomeScopeName" allowedConcurrentUsers="5">
    <SomeChildNode />
</SquadScope>
SendSquadEvent
Sends an event to squad members only. 
Note
The dynamic squad system uses the AI system's cluster detector. This tool is used with AISquadManager to group AI agents into dynamic squads.
Parameters
name
Name of the event to be sent.
Success/Failure
The node always SUCCEEDS after sending the event.
Example
<SendSquadEvent name="SomeEventName" />
IfSquadCount
Makes execution of a child node conditional on whether or not the number of squad members meets a specified condition. Although all parameters are optional, at least one parameter must be used.
Note
The dynamic squad system uses the AI system's cluster detector. This tool is used with AISquadManager to group AI agents into dynamic squads.
Parameters
isGreaterThan
(Optional) Condition statement used to test whether the number of squad members exceeds a specified value.
isLesserThan
(Optional) Condition statement used to test whether the number of squad members is under a specified value.
equals
(Optional) Condition statement used to test whether the number of squad members exactly equals a specified value.
Success/Failure
The node SUCCEEDS if the number of squad members satisfies the specified condition statement, and FAILS if not.
Example
<IfSquadCount isGreaterThan="1">
    <SomeChildNode />
</IfSquadCount>
