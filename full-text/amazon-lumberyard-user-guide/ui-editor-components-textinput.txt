TextInput
You can use a TextInput component to make an element offer player input. This component is typically applied to an element with an image component and two child elements with text components (one for placeholder text and one for input text).

To see in-game examples of completed canvases with the TextInput component, open the level UiFeatures in the project SamplesProject. Press CtrlG to play the game, and then choose Components, Interactable Components, TextInput. You can view examples of different types of text input behavior on single lines and on multiple lines. Press Esc to exit the game.
To view these same canvases in the UI Editor, navigate to the \Gems\LyShineExamples\Assets\UI\Canvases\LyShineExamples\Comp\TextInput directory. You can open the following canvases:
 Multiline.uicanvas – Examples of editing multiline text strings
 SingleLine.uicanvas – Example of editing single-line text strings
You can add a prebuilt TextInput element from the slice library. When you do this, a text input box, pause-on state, and placeholder text "Type here..." are automatically created in your Hierarchy pane.
