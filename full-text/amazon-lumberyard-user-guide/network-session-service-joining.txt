Joining a Session
You have two ways to join a session:
 By Searching for a Session and using a GridMate::SearchInfo object from the results.
 Directly to an existing game session by using a GridMate::SessionIdIffo object.
Regardless of the method, a session is joined using one of the overloaded IGridMate::JoinSession() functions after the session service has been started.
Note
The argument GridMate::JoinParams currently has no supported parameters.
Events
The following table describes GridMate session join events.




Event
Description




OnSessionJoined
The client has been successfully added to the session.


OnMemberJoined
A player has joined the session.


OnMemberLeaving
A player has left the session.



Example
The following example joins a session that has been found as the result of a session search.
```
void MyClass::OnGridSearchComplete(const GridMate::GridSearch search)
{
    GridMate::IGridMate gridMate = gEnv->pNetwork->GetGridMate();
if(gridMate)
{
    if(search->GetNumResults() > 0)
    {
        GridMate::Session* session = gridMate->JoinSession(search->GetResult(0), GridMate::JoinParams(), GridMate::CarrierDesc());
    }
}

}
void MyClass:OnSessionJoined(GridMate::GridSession* session)
{
    // Joined the session successfully
}
```
