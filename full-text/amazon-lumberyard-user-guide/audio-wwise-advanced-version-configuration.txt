Using a Different Wwise Version

Configuring an Earlier Version of Wwise for Lumberyard
Follow this procedure to use the 2017 version of Wwise.
To configure Lumberyard for the 2017 version of Wwise


Navigate to the lumberyard_version\dev\Gems\AudioEngineWwise\Code directory.


In a text editor, open the wwise_backwards_compatibility.README.txt file.


Follow the instructions in the file. The following is an overview of the instructions.


Download a 2017 version of Wwise.


Copy the Wwise_version\SDK directory from the Wwise install directory to the lumberyard_version\3rdParty\Wwise directory.


In a text editor, open the lumberyard_version\dev\SetupAssistantConfig.json file and modify the version of Wwise in the file.
This configures Lumberyard Setup Assistant to look for that specific version instead.


Add a .json file that defines the Wwise 2017 SDK for WAF.


After you complete these steps, run Lumberyard Setup Assistant and the lmbr_waf configure command to check for errors. 


If no errors occur, build Lumberyard Editor and Engine for Wwise 2017.
Configuring a Later Version of Wwise for Lumberyard
Audiokinetic frequently releases new versions of Wwise. Later versions might be compatible with the current version supported by Lumberyard without requiring major code changes. However, minor revisions can contain API updates that require code changes in Lumberyard. Major revisions can require code changes and deeper migration.
If you want to switch to later versions of Wwise, use the following procedure.
To configure Lumberyard for a later version of Wwise


Download the version of Wwise that you want.


Copy the Wwise_version\SDK directory from the Wwise install directory to the lumberyard_version\3rdParty\Wwise\your_new_wwise_version directory.


In a text editor, open the lumberyard_version\dev\SetupAssistantConfig.json file and replace all occurrences of 2018.1.4.6807 with the version that you downloaded.


This configures Lumberyard Setup Assistant to look for the version that you specify.
SetupAssistantConfig.json contains a section for Wwise and a separate section for Wwise LTX. Modify only the Wwise section.


Save and close the SetupAssistantConfig.json file.


Run Lumberyard Setup Assistant. Then verify that the new Wwise SDK version is configured correctly on the Install optional SDKs page.


You'll notice that the setup instructions Lumberyard Setup Assistant still mention Wwise 2018.1.4.6807. You can ignore this text.
