Finding the Material Parameter Name
You can specify material parameter names for some Script Canvas editor nodes. In the Material Editor, you can find the material parameter names in the following sections:
 Opacity Settings
 Lighting Settings
 Shader Params
You can find common parameters in the Opacity Settings and Lighting Settings sections. You can find parameters that are specific to the selected shader in the Shader Params section.

To find the material parameter name


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, Material Editor.


In the Material Editor, navigate to the material file.


In the Opacity Settings, Lighting Settings, and Shader Params sections, pause on a parameter to find the script parameter name.
