Setting Material Opacity
An object's opacity refers to its transparency level. Opacity is important when using an alpha channel for transparency. 
To set opacity for a material


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, Material Editor. 


In the Material Editor, search for or browse to your asset and then select it. 


Use the opacity settings to switch between alpha blend and alpha test modes. With the alpha blend mode, you can enable soft and semi-transparent opacity. The alpha test mode is more performant and uses a black and white hard edge from the alpha map.


Under Opacity Settings, you can adjust the following parameters:
    Opacity – Set the opacity mode and transparency amount of the material. For the alpha blend mode, set the value between 0 to 99. For the alpha test mode, set the value to 100.  

[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
    Alpha Test – Bias the edge of the alpha towards black or white. Set the value below 50 to bias toward the white of the alpha map. Set the value above 50 to bias toward the black of the alpha map.

    Additive – Enable to add the material color to the background color. This results in a brighter color for the object.
