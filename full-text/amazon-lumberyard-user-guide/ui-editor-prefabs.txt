Using and Creating UI Prefabs

This system has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
In the UI Editor, prefabs are preconfigured UI elements and compound elements that you can add to a canvas. You can also create custom prefabs.
To add a prefab element


In the UI Editor toolbar, click New, Element from prefab.


Select from:
    Button
    Checkbox
    Image
    LayoutColumn
    LayoutGrid
    LayoutRow
    ScrollBox
    ScrollBarHorizontal
    ScrollBarVertical
    Slider
    Text
    TextInput


The new element appears in the Hierarchy pane and viewport.
If you have created your own element or modified an existing prefab, you can save it as a custom prefab.
To save a custom prefab element


In the UI Editor, right-click an element that you have created or modified in the Hierarchy pane or viewport.


Click (Deprecated) Save as Prefab.


In the Save As dialog box, do the following:


Navigate to any location in the project folder where you want to save your prefab.


Name your prefab with a .uiprefab file extension.


Click Save.


Your prefab now appears in the New, (Deprecated) Element from prefab menu.
