Enable Color Correction
Sets color correction parameters. You can use this node to specify the CMYK, brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue in a scene. Most color correction properties aren't updated smoothly, so it's recommended that you hide stronger color correction changes with cuts or fading between scenes.
You can also apply color correction in the Track View. See Color Correction Node.
To disable the effect, see Disable Color Correction.
