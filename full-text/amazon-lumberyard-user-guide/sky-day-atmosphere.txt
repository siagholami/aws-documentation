Setting Daytime Atmospheric Effects
To create dynamic daytime sky atmospheric effects, you modify sun and light-scattering setting that affect the appearance of distant objects, which shift in color due to atmospheric interference. These settings do not directly affect the rendering of objects or environment lighting colors and intensities.
To set daytime atmospheric effects


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, Other, Time Of Day.


In the Parameters pane, for Sky Light, adjust the Sky Light Parameters as needed.


Close the Time of Day editor.
