Creating Navigation Areas

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
For a navigation mesh to be generated, a navigation area needs to be first added to your level. The bottom plane of the navigation area must be underneath the lowest point of the terrain the AI traverses, and the top plane of the navigation area must be above the height of the AI agent placed at the highest point of the terrain, allowing for plenty of clearance. If this is not done, the navigation mesh fails. A successfully created mesh will be blue in color.
Note
The ai_DebugDrawNavigation console variable must be set to 1, 2, or 3 in order that the navigable surface is displayed. 
To create a Navigation Area


In Lumberyard Editor, click AI, Create New Navigation Area.

In the level, drag and click to define a shape enclosing the area that the AI agent navigates through.
