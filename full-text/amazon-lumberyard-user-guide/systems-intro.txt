Working with Amazon Lumberyard systems APIs
Amazon Lumberyard provides a number of APIs to access and invoke key parts of the Lumberyard engine from your game, including a new in-game console and a new event management system.
These C APIs are called from your code, and provide important infrastructure functionality for your game, including messaging and communications, and an in-game console with variable and functor support.
You can find these APIs defined in the following headers:
 Event.h (in %INSTALL_ROOT%\dev\Code\Framework\AzCore\AzCore\EBus\) for AZ::Event
 IConsole.h (in %INSTALL_ROOT%\dev\Code\Framework\AzCore\AzCore\IConsole\) for AZ::Console
 Interface.h (in %INSTALL_ROOT%\dev\Code\Framework\AzCore\AzCore\Interface\) for AZ::Interface
Some of these systems APIs replace functionality from older versions, or provide alternative methods, such as AZ::Console for the CryConsole and AZ::Event for EBus.
For C API reference documentation, see the Amazon Lumberyard C API Reference.
