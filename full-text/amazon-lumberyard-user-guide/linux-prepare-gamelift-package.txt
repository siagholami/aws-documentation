Preparing the GameLift Package

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
Lumberyard supports compiling and deploying the Windows client for a multiplayer project on a Linux dedicated server. You must have completed the following:
 Compiled the assets on a Windows computer.
 Built the Lumberyard executable for use on a Linux computer.
 Tested the connection between the Windows client and the Linux server.
Once you have tested the client and server connection, you can prepare your GameLift package, which allows you to use Amazon GameLift to deploy your game servers. 
To prepare the GameLift package


On your Linux computer, in a terminal console window, run the following command: ./MultiplayerSample_CreateGameLiftPackage.sh


In the AWS CLI, enter the following to upload your package to Amazon GameLift:


aws gamelift upload-build --operating-system AMAZON_LINUX --build-root "./GameLiftPackageLinux" --name "your package name" --build-version "your build version" --region us-west-2
Note
If you do not have the AWS CLI installed, enter the following in the command line window:  
sudo pip install awscli
   sudo pip install --upgrade awscli
