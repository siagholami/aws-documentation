WaterVolume Shader
The Watervolume shader is used for rendering volumetric bodies of water including lakes, pools, and rivers and imparts various reflection, ripple, and foam effects. For the ocean, use the Water Shader instead. Here are a few notes regarding usage of this shader:
 The Detail normals texture is not an external texture, but rather a texture generated by Lumberyard through code.
 The Decal parameters don't appear under Shader Params unless you put a texture into the Decal slot first. The Decal Bumpmap slot also appears after this task.
 Flow map textures go in the Detail slot.
Shader Parameters
Detail normals scale
Scales the detail bump normals intensity.
Default value: 0.5
Detail tiling
Sets detail bump tilling.
Default value: 2.5
Env projection scale
Controls the projection scale, or the tiling, of the specified environment map.
Default value: 20
Env reflection amount
Controls the reflection amount of the environment map. Can be offset with Specular Color.
Default value: 1
Flow map scale
Controls the scale, or tiling, of the flow map texture. Enable Water flow map in Shader Generations Params to use this property.
Default value: 0
Flow speed
Specifies the speed of the flow effect. Water flow shader generation parameter must be enabled first.
Default value: 0
Foam amount
Controls the amount of foam placed on the water surface. Foam shader generation parameter must be enabled first.
Default value: 1
Foam soft intersection
Controls how the foam behaves from contact areas. Foam forms around intersecting objects and the terrain after it gets close to the surface. Foam shader generation parameter must be enabled first. 
Default value: 0.75
Foam tiling
Sets the tiling amount of the foam texture. Foam shader generation parameter must be enabled first.
Default value: 12
Normals scale
Controls the scale of the normals. Don't confuse this parameter with Detail normals.
Default value: 1.25
Rain ripples tiling
Sets the tiling amount for the rain ripples texture.
Default value: 1
Realtime reflection amount
Controls the reflection amount for the Realtime Reflection.
Default value: 1
Soft intersection factor
Similar to the Foam soft intersection but for the base water surface.
Default value: 1
Tiling
Changes the amount of texture map tilling on the water surface.
Default value: 10
Vertex wave scale
Sets strength of vertex displaced wave animation.
Default value: 0.125
Shader Generation Parameters
Realtime Reflection
Enables approximate real-time reflections.
Water flow
Enables water to flow along geometry UVs.
Water flow map
Enables water flow along a flow map.
Water flow map strength
Enables additional water flow strength controls, which requires the blue channel for strength.
Sun specular
Enables water sunshine.
Debug flow map
Enables visualizing flow map.
Foam
Enables foam.
