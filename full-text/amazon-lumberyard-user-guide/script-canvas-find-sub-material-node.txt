Find Sub-Material
Finds and returns the submaterial with the specified name and submaterial ID.
Lumberyard has two types of material assets:
 Materials – A basic single item that represents one material.
 Multimaterials – A material that contains multiple submaterials inside it. 
You can use the Find Sub-Material node to access a submaterial that is inside a multimaterial. To access the submaterial, specify the name of the multimaterial and the ID of one of its submaterials. Material IDs range from the number of available submaterials. For example, if a multimaterial has five submaterials, you can specify a value from 1 to5.
To access a single material, you can use the Find by Name node.
