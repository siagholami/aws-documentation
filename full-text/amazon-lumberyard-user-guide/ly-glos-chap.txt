bind pose
The pose that a character has when you bind the mesh (skin) to the skeleton. The skeleton determines the pose.
blend shape
Method that stores a deformed version of a mesh as a series of vertex positions. In each keyframe of an animation, the vertices are interpolated between these stored positions. Also known as morph target animation or per-vertex animation.
blend space
Animation blending that is treated as geometry. A character's kinematic, physical, and other high-level motion-related parameters are mapped onto corresponding features that are stored in animation clips. By storing such motion as parameters, controllable interactive animations are possible. Specifically, an animation is associated with a 1D, 2D, or 3D location in the blend space. Also known as a bspace.

k-means clustering
Method for partitioning a set of data points into k separate groups. Each group has a mean calculated from the average of the points it contains and each point is assigned to a group based on which group mean the point is closest to. The method usually works iteratively, alternating between updating point assignments and updating mean values until a stable partition is reached.
