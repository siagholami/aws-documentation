Input Management Framework Gem

The Input Management Framework Gem is in preview release and is subject to change. 
The Input Management Framework gem provides a framework for managing cross-platform game input such as keyboard, controller, and touch in Lumberyard with the component entity system. 

The gem works with the Starting Point Input gem, which supplies the processed raw input. The Input Management Framework gem then takes that input and converts it to user-defined gameplay events with the Input component. 
For an example, see Working with the Input Component.
For more information, see Input in Amazon Lumberyard.
