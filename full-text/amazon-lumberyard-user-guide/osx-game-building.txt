Building macOS Games

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
Before you can run your game on a macOS computer, you must ensure the shader compiler (located in the lumberyard_version\dev\Tools\CrySCompileServer\x64\profile directory) is running on your PC. For more information, see Building Shaders for macOS Games.
To build your game for macOS


On your Mac, in a Terminal window, navigate to the root directory of your Lumberyard installation (lumberyard_version/dev).


To generate an Xcode project and prepare the Lumberyard build system to build your app, run the following command: sh lmbr_waf.sh configure xcode_mac
Note
Metal is the default renderer.


Do one of the following to build your game:
    Use a command line to build various targets of your game:

To build debug, run the following command: sh lmbr_waf.sh build_darwin_x64_debug -p all
To build profile, run the following command: sh lmbr_waf.sh build_darwin_x64_profile -p all
To build release, run the following command: sh lmbr_waf.sh build_darwin_x64_release -p all
Use Xcode and the generated solution located in the Solutions folder in the directory where you installed Lumberyard to build your game.
