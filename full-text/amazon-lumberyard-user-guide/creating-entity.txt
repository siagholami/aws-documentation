Creating an Entity
Entities are objects with which the player interacts.
To create an entity
 Do one of the following:
 In the Lumberyard Editor viewport, right-click and choose Create entity. This creates an entity at the cursor location with a basic Transform component, which gives the entity a 3D location in the level.
 In the Entity Outliner, right-click and choose Create entity. This creates an entity in the center of your viewport.
 Use the Asset Browser to create entities that already have the preferred configuration, depending on the particular asset. 
For example, if you drag a .cgf mesh asset from the Asset Browser into the viewport, Lumberyard creates an entity, adds a Mesh component, and assigns the asset to the Mesh component. The same is possible for particles, slices, and Lua scripts.
To assign entities to a parent entity


In the viewport or the Entity Outliner, right-click and then choose Create entity. This creates a an empty entity, which will be the parent entity.


Do one of the following:
    In the Entity Outliner, select and drag the child entities on top of the new parent entity.
    Select one or more entities that are to be the child entities. In the Entity Inspector, for the Transform component, beside the Parent Entity property, click the picker icon  and then select the parent entity in the viewport.
    Select one or more entities that are to be the child entities. From the Entity Outliner, drag the parent entity into the Entity Inspector and drop it beneath the Transform component into the Parent Entity property.
