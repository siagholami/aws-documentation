Creating levels and adding environment effects
A level, also known as world or map, represents the space or area available to the player during the course of completing a discrete game objective. Most games consist of multiple levels through which a player can advance to or move through, although usually only a single level is loaded at a time. Each level can be grouped into multiple layers, which you use to logically group types of objects.
The environment includes lighting, terrain, bodies of water, vegetation, sky, and weather effects.
