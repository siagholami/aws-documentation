ThirdPartySDKs Commands
Before you can use thirdpartysdks commands, you must set up your workspace. To do this, run Lumberyard Setup Assistant and perform each step of the setup process.
The thirdpartysdks module manages the installation states of third party SDKs. These are specified by default in the \3rdParty\ directory. If you have defined a different third party SDKs path in the SetupAssistantUserPreferences.ini configuration file, then this module manages the SDKs in that path. 
The thirdpartysdks module has dependencies on the following:
 Engines module
 Capabilities module – Downloads only the SDKs that are required based on the user-enabled capabilities.
 Packages module
 SetupAssistantUserPreferences.ini – Path specified for the SDKSearch3rdParty property.
 SetupAssistantConfig.json – Parses the SDK required for the engine 
Use the following commands to manage Lumberyard third party SDKs.
