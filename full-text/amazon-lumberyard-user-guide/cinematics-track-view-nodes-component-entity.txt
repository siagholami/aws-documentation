Component Entities and Component Nodes
Topics
 Naming and Identifying Component Entities
 Adding or Removing Components from a Component Entity
 Animating Components on a Component Entity
In the Track View, component entity nodes function as containers for component nodes. 
When you add an animation using the Track View, the animation track is applied to a component node. Component entity nodes don't directly have tracks or key properties. 
Example
The component entity GameObject contains Transform, Mesh, and Point Light components. When you add the GameObject component entity to a sequence in the Track View, you can see all the components in the node browser. The component entity node is a reference to which components are animated in the sequence.  

Component nodes that can be animated are nested as children under the associated entity node. You can add animation tracks to any of these component nodes. 
To add a track to an animation node


In the Track View, create or select a sequence.


In the node browser, right-click and choose Add Track, then choose the component property.


Not all components can be animated in the Track View. For example, you can add the Visibility track only for the Mesh component. The Point Light component has multiple tracks that you can add to the sequence. In the following example, the Color, DiffuseMultiplier, and Visible tracks are added to the sequence.

For more information about adding node support to the Track View, see Exposing Custom Components to Track View for Animation.
Naming and Identifying Component Entities
Lumberyard uses entity IDs to identify component entities, which means that you can name your component entities as you want. This includes reusing the same name for multiple entities. In the Track View, if component entity nodes share the same name, a number is appended to the name. This doesn't change the name of the component entity in the level, but it might be difficult to determine which entity to animate. 
Example 

If you have component entities with the same name (for example, if they're multiple instances of a slice), you can determine which entity that you're editing. For more information, see Working with Slices and Sequences.
Adding or Removing Components from a Component Entity
When you add a component to a component entity in Lumberyard Editor, the component is automatically added to any component entity nodes in the Track View. When you remove a component, the component and any animation data are also removed from the Track View. 
Important
Be careful when removing components from component entities because it might affect your existing sequence. For example, if you remove a Simple Motion component from an entity that is part of a sequence, the animation no longer references the specified animation.

Note
Some components support only a limited number of tracks that can be animated in a sequence. For more information for component-specific properties, see the Component Reference.

After you add the component entity nodes to the sequence and specify the tracks to animate, you can then add keyframes to the timeline. In keyframes, you specify where in the timeline you want to animate the property and edit its properties.
