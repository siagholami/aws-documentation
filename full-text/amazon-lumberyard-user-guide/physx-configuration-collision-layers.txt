Collision Layers
Use collision layers to group objects of the same type. Use collision groups to define what the collision layers collide with. You can have a maximum of 64 layers per game.
Common types of layers are objects like the following:
 Terrain
 Static objects
 Players
 Enemies
 Projectiles
The layers that you define are specific to your game. When a collider is created, it is assigned a collision layer with index [0] called Default. This can't be changed.
To create a collision layer


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, PhysX Configuration.


Click the Layers tab.


Type the name of the layer into an available text field. Layer names must be 32 characters or less.



To assign a collision layer to a collider


In the Lumberyard Editor viewport, create an entity and select it.


In the Entity Inspector, add a PhysX Collider component to the entity.


In the PhysX Collider component, for Collision Layer, choose one of the colliders that you created from the drop-down list.



Notes

If you rename a layer, its references are updated automatically, but you can't reorder layers.
If an entity with a PhysX Collider component is selected in the viewport and you use the PhysX Configuration window to create, rename, or delete a collision layer, the changes do not appear in the Entity Inspector. To see the changes, deselect and reselect the entity in the viewport.
