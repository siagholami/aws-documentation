Virtual Reality Samples Project
The Virtual Reality Samples Project is a template that you can use to build virtual reality (VR) applications for any supported device. The sample is configured with the base set of gems (HMD Framework, Oculus, and OpenVR) that you need for VR and demonstrates the following essential VR features:
 Room-scale VR setup
 Tracked controller input system
 Spatialized audio playback
 Stereo 360 video playback

To install the Virtual Reality Samples Project


Download the vrproject.zip package at Lumberyard Downloads and extract it in your Lumberyard directory, such as lumberyard_version\


Open Lumberyard Setup Assistant and on the Summary page, click Configure project.
Note
To ensure that the VR project launches, you must use Lumberyard Setup Assistant to open the Project Configurator. Lumberyard Setup Assistant copies required SDKs from the 3rdParty directory into the dev\VirtualRealityProject directory.


In the Project Configurator, select VirtualRealityProject and then click Set as default.


Close the Project Configurator.


Open Lumberyard Setup Assistant.


Download the required SDKs to view video playback for the Virtual Reality Samples Project. 
Important
The video playback on the TV in the VR_TVRoom_Sample level must be enabled before you can view video playback. For instructions on setting up video playback, see Setting Up Video Playback. 


Close Lumberyard Setup Assistant.


After completing video playback setup, you must also build the virtual reality project.


Start Editor.exe from one of the following directories:
    For Visual Studio 2017, use the lumberyard_version\dev\Bin64vc141 directory.
    For Visual Studio 2019, use the lumberyard_version\dev\Bin64vc142 directory.
