Adding Fog Beneath Water

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
You can add realistic-looking fog beneath water surfaces. For more information about Lumberyard's fog system, see Fog Systems.
To add fog beneath water


In your level, click to select the water volume entity in which you want to add fog.


In the Rollup Bar, on the Objects tab, click Area, WaterVolume, WaterVolume Params, and modify the following parameters as needed.
FogDensity
Specifies how dense the fog appears. 
FogColor
Sets the fog color.
FogColorMultiplier
Defines how bright the fog color is.
FogColorAffectedBySun
Enables the Setting Sun Parameters and Console Variables Sun color parameter value to affect fog color.
FogShadowing
Enables the surface of water to receive shadows. You can control the shadow darkness. Valid values are 0â€“1. 
For this parameter to function, the console variable r_FogShadowsWater must be set to 1. FogShadowing is only available when the Config Spec setting in Lumberyard Editor is set to Very High. 
In addition, if the VolFogShadows property is enabled in the Terrain\Environment panel in Rollup Bar, shadow darkness is automatically set to full. However, the fog above the water will have volumetric shadowing.
CapFogAtVolumeDepth
If false, continues to render fog below the specified river depth.
