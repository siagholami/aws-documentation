Gradient Editor UI Options
The Gradient Editor includes the following:
 Location – Sets the location value range from 0% – 100%.
 Color – Opens the Color Picker.
 Gradient box – Applies the combined gradient and alpha.
 Gradient viewport
   The x-axis represents the gradient generator of the color change over the full gradient.
   The y-axis represents 0 – 100% alpha of the gradient color.
 Default Library, alpha curve – Provides alpha curves to use as a starting point.
 Default Library, gradient – Provides gradients to use as a starting point.
Working with Color Gradients
When you select a gradient from the Default Library, it displays with the alpha curve in the Gradient Editor viewport. You can do the following when selecting a gradient:
To change the gradient color
 Click the triangle keyframes and select a new color from the Color Picker.
To add a color to the gradient
 Double-click the X-axis to generate a color keyframe. The color in the color thumbnail is added to the gradient viewport. Any adjustments you make to the gradient is reflected in the gradient viewport.
To display the RGBA values
 Pause on the color keyframe.
To delete a color keyframe
 Select the keyframe and press Delete. The selected keyframe has an orange outline.
To adjust the alpha curve
 Click and drag the circle (alpha keyframe) in the gradient viewport. Move the circle up (towards 100%) or down (towards 0%) to adjust the alpha percentage. Moving the circle left or right adjusts the curve based on the curve endpoints.
To display the alpha curve context menu
 Right-click the alpha curve keyframe. The following options are available: Delete selected keys, Create flat or linear curves, Adjust the in-and-out tangent of the curve to be linear or flat, Add a created curve to the library or preset list, and Reset the curve to defaults.
To add an alpha key
 Double-click the curve in the gradient viewport.
To delete an alpha key
 Select the circle key and press Delete.
To add a generated alpha curve to the preset list
 Click the  button.
To add a generated gradient to the gradient preset list
 Click the  button.
To delete a curve or gradient preset
