Using the Flatten Brush

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
The Flatten brush makes any piece of terrain completely flat at a height that you define. This is useful for creating a variety of features such as plateaus, mesas, and buttes as well as creating flat spots wherever needed.
To use the Flatten brush


In the Rollup Bar, on the Terrain tab, click Modify, Flatten.


In the level, drag the mouse to create a flat spot. The terrain is flattened at the selected Height and Diameter brush settings.


Under Modify Terrain, adjust Brush Settings and Noise Settings parameters as needed. See Terrain Brush Parameters for more information.
