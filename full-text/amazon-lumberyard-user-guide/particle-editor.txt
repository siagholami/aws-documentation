Using the Particle Editor

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
Use the Particle Editor to create, edit, preview, and save particle libraries and emitters that are used with entities in your levels.
To open the Particle Editor
 In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, Particle Editor. You can also click the particle editor icon in the Lumberyard Editor toolbar.

The Particle Editor includes the following UI elements:
 Libraries panel – Lists the particle art assets. You can view and interact with multiple libraries simultaneously.
 Preview panel – Displays the selected, active particle effect. The preview camera automatically positions to capture the entire particle. Use the W, A, S, and D keys and mouse controls to pan, zoom, and rotate the camera.
 Attributes panel – Lists the properties for the selected particle.
 Level of Detail panel – Displays level of detail (LOD) information for added particles. For more information, see Managing Particle Level of Detail (LOD).
Adding a Particle Component
To add a particle component to your level
 Do one of the following:
   Drag a particle emitter from the Particle Editor library and drop it into the Lumberyard Editor viewport.
   Drag a particle effect asset from the Asset Browser into your scene. Choose the emitter that you want to use from the Entity Inspector properties. For more information, see Entity Inspector.
   Create a Particle component entity and assign the particle effect with the Particle effect library parameter. For more information, see the Particle component and Adding Components to an Entity.
