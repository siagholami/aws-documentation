Console Variables for Volumetric Fog
You can specify the following console variables (CVARs) to enable volumetric fog effects. For more information, see Using the Console Window.




Console Variable
Description
Values




e_VolumetricFog
Toggles the Volumetric Fog component on or off.
0 = Off  1 = On


r_VolumetricFogTexScale
Sets the width and height of the internal volume texture. Screen resolution divided by this factor is applied to the width and height of the fog volume.
The minimum value should be 2.


r_VolumetricFogTexDepth
Sets the depth for the internal volume texture.
This value should be multiples of 4, but less than 252.


r_VolumetricFogReprojectionBlendFactor
Sets the blending factor of the temporal reprojection filter. Higher values cause less flicker, but more ghosting.
0 = Turn off temporal reprojection.


r_VolumetricFogReprojectionMode
Sets the mode of ghost reduction for the temporal re-projection filter.
0 = Conservative mode. Ghost artifacts can appear when a light moves, but there is less flicker than in the advanced mode. 1 = Advanced mode. This mode has fewer ghost artifacts but slightly more flicker than the conservative mode.


r_VolumetricFogSample
Sets the number of sample points.
0 = 1 sample point in a voxel. 1 = 2 sample points in a voxel. 2 = 4 sample points in a voxel.


r_VolumetricFogShadow
Sets the shadow sample count for each sample point.
0 = 1 shadow sample per sample point. 1 = 2 shadow samples per sample point. 2 = 3 shadow samples per sample point. 3 = 4 shadow samples per sample point.


r_VolumetricFogDownscaledSunShadow
Replaces sun shadow maps with downscaled shadow maps or static shadow maps, if possible. This reduces the volumetric fog flicker for sun shadow.
0 = Disabled. 1 = Replace first and second cascades with downscaled shadow maps. Others are replaced with a static shadow map, if possible. 2 = Replace first, second, and third cascades with downscaled shadow maps. Others are replaced with a static shadow map, if possible.


r_VolumetricFogDownscaledSunShadowRatio
Sets the downscale ratio for sun shadow maps.
0 = 1/4 downscaled sun shadow maps. 1 = 1/8 downscaled sun shadow maps. 2 = 1/16 downscaled sun shadow maps.


r_VolumetricFogMinimumLightBulbSize
Sets the minimum size threshold for light attenuation bulb size for voxel-based volumetric fog.   Small bulb sizes can cause light flicker.
Specify a value between 0 to 2.  Default value: 0.4
