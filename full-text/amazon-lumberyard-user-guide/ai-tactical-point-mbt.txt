Integration with the Modular Behavior Tree System
From inside the Modular Behavior Tree (MBT), the  node can be used to call pre-defined TPS queries by name. The  node will return either success or failure. 
The most common usage pattern involving the  node is to use it in conjunction with the  node inside a  to determine the status of a specified position. The example below illustrates a call to a pre-defined TPS query called SDKGrunt_TargetPositionOnNavMesh, with the expected inputs. If the query succeeds, the AI agent will move to the queried position.
<Sequence>
    <QueryTPS name="SDKGrunt_TargetPositionOnNavMesh" register="RefPoint"/>
    <Move to="RefPoint" speed="Run" stance="Alerted" fireMode="Aim" avoidDangers="0"/>
</Sequence>
The definition of the pre-defined query SDKGrunt_TargetPositionOnNavMesh is as follows.
AI.RegisterTacticalPointQuery({
    Name = "SDKGrunt_TargetPositionOnNavMesh",
    {
        Generation =
        {
            pointsInNavigationMesh_around_attentionTarget = 20.0
        },
        Conditions =
        {
        },
        Weights =
        {
            distance_to_attentionTarget = -1.0
        },
    },
});
