Adding Lua Scripts to Component Entities
Lumberyard makes it easy for you to add script functionality to your game entities by using the Lua Script component. The following steps show you how to do this in Lumberyard Editor.
To add a Lua script to a component entity in Lumberyard Editor


With the Entity Inspector view pane visible, select the entity in the viewport.


Click Add Component, and then open Scripting, Lua Script.



Scroll down to the Scripting section, and then click Lua Script.



A Lua Script component appears in the inspector. Use the file selection button (...) to select the Lua script from the file hierarchy that you want to use.



You can select either a .lua file (a text copy of the original), or a .luac file (a precompiled version of the script). The functionality should be the same. The precompiled version is preferable because it loads faster and is usually smaller. However, you can use.lua files if you experience any issues.

After the script is loaded, click Edit Script ({}) to launch the Lua IDE and make changes to your script.
