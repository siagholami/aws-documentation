Lighting Attribute
In the Lighting attribute, specify how to control the particle lighting.

Lighting Attribute Parameters 



Name
Description




Light Source
(CPU only) Causes each particle to create a deferred light, where color is equal to the Color value.[See the AWS documentation website for more details]Valid values: 0Default value: false, 0, 0


Diffuse Lighting
Multiplies the particle color for dynamic (diffuse) lighting. Valid values: 0Default value: 1


Diffuse Backlighting
Specifies the fraction of diffuse lighting that is applied to unlit particle directions.Valid values: 0 (standard diffuse and normals facing the light are lit the most) to 1 (omnidirectional diffuse and light affects all normals equally).Default value: 0


Emissive Lighting
Multiplies the particle color for constantly emitting light. You can add a value to make a particle appear as if it's glowing. Valid values: 0Default value: 0


Environment Probe Lighting
(CPU only) Controls the amount of diffuse lighting that is contributed from environment probes.Valid values: 0 to 1Default value: 0


Receive Shadows
(CPU only) Allows shadows to cast on the particles. Default value: false


Cast Shadows
(GPU and geometry particles only) Allows particles to cast shadows. Default value: false


Not Affected by Fog
(CPU only) Causes particles to ignore scene fog. Default value: false



Note
When there is a single light source, some or all particles can appear unlit (black). To address this:
Add an environment probe to the scene to create indirect lighting. For more information, see the Environment Probe component.
Specify a value for the Environment Probe Lighting parameter to enable environment probe lighting on the particle system. For example, a value of 0.5 applies light from the environment probe at half intensity.
