Applying a Texture Layer Material
All terrain texture layer materials use the Terrain.Layer Shader. All terrain materials should be "high-passed" in your DCC tool in order for them to work correctly with this shader.
To apply or edit a material for a texture layer


In Lumberyard Editor, click Tools, Other, Terrain Texture Layers.


In Terrain Texture Layers, double-click the layer you want to apply or edit a material for.


In Material Editor, expand the tree and select your asset.


Change settings and shader parameters as needed.


In Terrain Texture Layers, click Assign Material.


Close Material Editor.
