Waf Debugging with AZ Code Generator

AZ Code Generator is in preview release and is subject to change.
You can debug the integration output of Waf's Python scripts by using PyCharm and a few key debugging entry points. For more information about Waf integration itself, see AZ Code Generator Integration with Waf .

Prerequisites 
Before you start, follow the instructions for Setting Up PyCharm for Debugging Waf . The PyCharm debugger must be set up to debug lmbr_waf before you can continue. 
Identifying and Configuring Debug Output
All AZ Code Generator Waf integration output is prefixed with az_code_gen. To see additional output from both task creation and task execution, add --zones=az_code_gen to the Waf command line. This exposes the commands that invoke AZ Code Generator and are useful for debugging the AZ Code Generator utility itself. For more information, see Debugging the AZ Code Generator Utility. 
Debugging Wscript Configuration
To debug most configuration problems, it is best to set a breakpoint in the create_code_generator_tasks method in dev\Tools\Build\waf-<version>\lmbrwaflib\az_code_generator.py . This method is called for each wscript file that uses the az_code_gen feature. It directly interprets the given passes and generates an az_code_gen task for each input file in each pass.  
Debugging az_code_gen Task Creation
The create_az_code_generator_task feature creates az_code_gen tasks. It gathers most information and inserts it into the task. Each task gets added to the az_code_gen_group Waf task to ensure it is executed prior to other tasks. 
Debugging az_code_gen Task Execution
The run and handle_code_generator_output commands are important points in task execution.  
The run command takes the available information and generates a Clang-style arguments file prefixed with the @ symbol. The arguments file is passed on the command line to the AZ Code Generator utility. 
handle_code_generator_output - The AZ Code Generator utility returns a JSON object with one or more entries that are parsed by handle_code_generator_output. If the AZ Code Generator utility returns an invalid, non-JSON response due to errors during execution, the Waf task returns the error message No JSON-Object could be decoded. To discover the return value that could not be handled, run the command outside of Waf.
