Setting Ocean Parameters

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
When you create a new level, Lumberyard creates an ocean by default, complete with waves and reflections. The ocean uses the Water Shader. You can change the ocean's various properties and effects.
To set ocean parameters


In the Rollup Bar, on the Terrain tab, click Environment.


Under Ocean, adjust the following parameter values:
    Material – Click the (...) icon to access Material Editor and select your asset.
    Caustic depth – Set the depth to which caustic effects are visible.
    Caustic intensity – Scale the intensity of the caustics for the water surface normals.
    Caustic tiling – Scale the caustic tiling applied to the water surface normals. You can scale caustics independently of the surface material in cases of strong tiled normals or vice-versa.
