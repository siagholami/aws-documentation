Configuring your Project for Virtual Reality
Add one or more Virtual Reality gems available in Lumberyard Editor to enable virtual reality for supported head-mounted displays (HMDs). You can add the gem(s) to new or existing projects. If you add more than one gem, the system automatically detects which HMD is connected, and uses the appropriate gem code to control the specific HMD and any associated virtual reality (VR) controllers. 
Supported HMDs include:
 Oculus – Oculus Rift HMD
 OpenVR – HTC Vive HMD
Note
Use the NullVR Gem to run your level through the HMD framework without a connected VR device. This is useful for VR graphics debugging. For more information about this Gem, see NullVR Gem.
To add the Virtual Reality Gem(s)


Use the Lumberyard Setup Assistant to open the Project Configurator.


Select the project you want to add the Virtual Reality Gem to, or create a new project. Then click Set as Default.


Click Enable Gems below the project name.


Type VR into the search tool. Enable the HMD Framework Gem and one or more of the Virtual Reality gems:
    Oculus
    OpenVR
    NullVR



Click Save.


After you enable the gem(s), you must build your project before they are available in Lumberyard Editor.
