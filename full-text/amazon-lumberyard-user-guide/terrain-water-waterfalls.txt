Adding Waterfalls
A waterfall is a natural feature to add to cliffs or when a river changes elevation or course. Waterfalls are placed as 2D decals in the terrain. 
To add a waterfall


In Lumberyard Editor, click Tools, Material Editor.


In the Material Editor, select a suitable texture asset.


Under Material Settings, select the Waterfall shader.


Under Texture Maps, place the texture in the alpha channel of the Diffuse texture map.


Expand Diffuse\Oscillator and adjust parameter values to produce a realistic animation effect for the texture.


Under Shader Params, adjust Foam parameters as needed.


Adjust other material settings and shader parameters as needed.


Place the waterfall in your level, clicking to create a simple geometry that follows the terrain.


Apply water (rain) particle effects if desired.
