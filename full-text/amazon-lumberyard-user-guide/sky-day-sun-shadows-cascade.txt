Adding Cascaded Sun Shadows
You can create multiple cascaded shadow maps for your level, which controls how sun shadows look at varying distances. The higher the cascade, the further it is away from the camera (cascade 0 is closest to the camera) and the lower the resolution of the shadows.
To create cascaded sun shadows


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, Other, Time Of Day.


In the Parameters pane, for Shadows, adjust the Shadows Parameters as needed for each shadow cascade.


Close the Time of Day editor.
