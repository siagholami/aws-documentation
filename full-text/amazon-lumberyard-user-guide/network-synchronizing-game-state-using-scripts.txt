Synchronizing Game State Using Scripts
You can synchronize game state by using the Lua ScriptComponent. The initial steps of synchronizing game state using the Lua ScriptComponent are similar to any other component. There are two main steps:


You must add a NetBindingComponent to the definition of the entity that contains the script and the ScriptComponent and whose state you want to synchronize.


Inside the script, any properties that need to be synchronized must be tagged accordingly. For more information, see Network Binding Properties in the Writing Lua Scripts topic.


When these steps are completed, your game state data should synchronize correctly.
