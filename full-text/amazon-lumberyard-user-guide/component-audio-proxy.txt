Audio Proxy
The Audio Proxy component is a required dependency if you add multiple audio components to an entity. It acts as a proxy audio object wrapped in a component. For example, if you have an audio trigger component and an audio rtpc component on the same entity, they communicate to the same audio object using this audio proxy component.
