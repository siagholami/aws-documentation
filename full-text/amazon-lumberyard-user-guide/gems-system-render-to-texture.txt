Render to Texture

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
Enable the Render to Texture gem for your game so that you can use the Render to Texture component. You can use this component to render the scene to a texture from the viewport of the selected camera. For example, you can add game objects such as mirrors, security camera screens, and draw 3D models.

Note
The Render to Texture component currently supports DirectX 11 for Windows.
