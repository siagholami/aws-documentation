Compiling Assets on a Windows Computer

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
You must compile assets and the 3rdParty directory for the multiplayer project on a Windows computer. Once compiled, you can deploy assets to either a Linux server or Windows client.
To compile assets on a Windows computer


Run the Project Configurator (located in the \lumberyard_version\dev\Bin64 directory).


In the Project Configurator, select MultiplayerProject and click Set as default.


Close the Project Configurator.


Edit the bootstrap.cfg file (located in the \dev directory) to set connect_to_remote to 0.


Run the following command from the \dev directory: lmbr_waf.bat configure


Follow these instructions for Build and bundle assets for release in Lumberyard. Alternatively, you can run the BuildMultiplayerSample_Paks_PC_dedicated.bat file (located in the \dev directory).


To create a Linux deployment package, run the MultiplayerSample_LinuxPacker.bat file (located in the \dev directory) as Administrator.


Note
Deployment archives are created in the \dev\unix_archives directory and uniquely named based on the creation time.
Tip
If you plan to deploy over a slow network connection, you can use the --compress option to create a smaller archive.
To deploy files to a Linux computer
Use your preferred file transfer tool to deploy the YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.tar file on your Windows computer to your Linux computer. For more information, see Connect to Your Linux Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Note
You do not need to deploy files to a Linux computer if you use the same computer to compile and to deploy files.
