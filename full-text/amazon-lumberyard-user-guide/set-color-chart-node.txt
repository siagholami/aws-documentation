Set Color Chart
Applies a color chart texture for color grading.
Note
When you call the node for the first time, you must set a default color chart for the fade to work correctly. The Set Color Chart node uses this color chart as a reference to fade into the next color chart. If the Set Color Chart node doesn't have a default color chart to fade from, the node will immediately fade to the first color chart, regardless of the fade time.
For an example script, see Example Set Color Chart Script.
