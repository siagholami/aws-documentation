Working with camera screen effects
You can use rendering cameras to define custom views within your level. You can trigger them using the Track View or the Enable Depth Of Field Script Canvas node. Rendering cameras are used frequently for animated sequences.
For more information about how to add and use rendering cameras, see Camera Entity.
Depth of Field
Lumberyard uses an efficient gather-based depth of field (DOF) implementation. Depth of field is used to enhance the realism of a scene by simulating the way a real-world camera works. Use a broad depth of field to focus on all or nearly all of a scene. Use a narrow depth of field to focus on objects that are within a certain distance from the camera.



You can enable depth of field by using the r_depthOfFieldMode console variable. To control depth of field use the Track View or the Enable Depth Of Field Script Canvas node.
Motion Blur
Lumberyard uses a sample-weighted motion blur implementation whose settings mirror real-world camera shutter speed settings.
