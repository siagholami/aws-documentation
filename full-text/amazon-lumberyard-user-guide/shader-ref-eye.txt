Eye Shader
The Eye shader is used to render realistic eyes that take sclera, cornea, iris, and eye moisture properties into account.
Shader Parameters
Cornea Refraction
Controls and optionally animates pupil size. 
Default value: 0.01
Cornea Smoothness
Controls the glossiness of corneas reflections.
The default creates smaller and sharper highlights that are more lifelike.
Default value: 1
Indirect bounce color
Sets the amount of indirectly bounced color. Has no effect when the Physically Based Shading (PBR) model is used.
Default value: 136,136,136
Iris Color
Tweaks the iris color without affecting the eye white. 
Iris Color can be used for eye variation between characters that use the same texture.
Default value: 187,187,187
Iris Depth
Simulates the actual form of the iris, since the in-game mesh has the shape of a sphere. 
Default value: 0.005
Iris Shadowing
Controls iris self-shadowing, which further simulates the actual form of the iris. 
This effect is only affected by sunlight and not by other light sources.
Default value: 5
Iris SSS
Controls the subsurface scattering (SSS) amount of the iris, which blurs the shadows. Higher values blur the shading more.
Default value: 0.6
Sclera SSS
Controls the subsurface scattering (SSS) amount of the eye whites, which blurs the shadows. Higher values blur the shading more.
Default value: 0.4
Depth bias scale
Sets the depth bias of the overlay mesh to avoid clipping with the eyes.
This parameter requires that the Specular overlay shader generation parameter is enabled.
Default value: 
Diffuse occlusion strength
Controls the strength of the occlusion effect on the eyes.
This parameter requires that the Ambient occlusion overlay shader generation parameter is enabled.
Default value: 1
Specular occlusion strength
Controls the strength of the occlusion effect on the eyes' specular highlights.
This parameter requires that the Ambient occlusion overlay shader generation parameter is enabled.
Default value: 1
Shader Generation Parameters
Environment map
Enables environment map as a separate texture.
If the blending cube map feature isnâ€™t used, Environment map must be enabled and nearest_cubemap must be assigned for the texture's environment.
Ambient occlusion overlay
Enables ambient occlusion overlay rendering.
Must be enabled to use the occlusion mesh that overlays the eye. This mesh gives the eyes a more natural shadowing and integrates them with the head.
Specular overlay
Enables the eye water mesh.
