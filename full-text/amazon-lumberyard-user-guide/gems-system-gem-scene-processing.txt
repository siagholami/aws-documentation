Scene Processing Gem
Use the Scene Processing gem to specify the default settings for processing scene files such as .fbx for your games. For example, you can use the FBX Settings tool to specify the file types and settings that you want for your .fbx files. Asset Processor then processes the files so that they are available in the Asset Browser.

Note
The Scene Processing gem is required and enabled by default for Lumberyard projects.
For information about working with file types and settings, see FBX Soft Naming Conventions.
