Creating Font Families
You can combine multiple font assets into a single font family group.
The following is an example of a .fontfamily file.
<fontfamily name="MyFontFamily">
    <font>
        <file path="myfontfamily-regular.xml" />
        <file path="myfontfamily-bold.xml" tags="b" />
        <file path="myfontfamily-italic.xml" tags="i" />
        <file path="myfontfamily-bolditalic.xml" tags="b,i" />
    </font>
</fontfamily>
The UI system uses the font family definitions to determine which font asset to apply when styling text. You can combine the following types of assets:
 Unstyled – Font representing text with no styling applied. In the preceding example, this is myfontfamily-regular.xml.
 Bold – Font representing text with bold styling.
 Italic – Font representing text with italic styling.
 Bold-Italic – Font representing text with both bold and italic styling.
Font Family File XML
To create a new font family file, you can create a new, empty plain text file and enter the contents, or you can modify an existing font family file.
To add a new font family file to your UI


To create a new font family file, do one of the following:
    Open Notepad (or similar program) and save an empty text file with a .fontfamily file extension.
    Copy an existing .fontfamily file into your game project's Fonts directory. 


Name your .fontfamily file appropriately (leave the .fontfamily extension).


Open your .fontfamily file and edit the contents to configure the font family.


For example:
<fontfamily name="MyFontFamily">
       <font>
           <file path="myfontfamily-regular.xml" />
           <file path="myfontfamily-bold.xml" tags="b" />
           <file path="myfontfamily-italic.xml" tags="i" />
           <file path="myfontfamily-bolditalic.xml" tags="b,i" />
       </font>
   </fontfamily>
After the Asset Processor has processed your font assets, you can select your font family by selecting the *.fontfamily file in the UI Editor as the font for any text component. To apply custom styling to text using the font family, see Text Styling Markup.
The .fontfamily file uses XML. The UI system supports the following tags and attributes for the .fontfamily file:
Tag: fontfamily
Attribute: name
The unique name of the font family. Each font family name in a project must be unique, and only one fontfamily tag may be specified per .fontfamily file. You can, however, reuse the same font XML files (defined by the file tag) in multiple font families.
Tag: font
Container tag for the file tag.
Attribute: lang
The language that the font files should be associated with. The font files are loaded only if the listed language is being used. This enables a single font family to use different fonts and styling depending on the language being used.
Tag: file
Attribute: path
The path to the font XML, a TTF or OTF file. The path is relative to the font family file. The same font asset can be referenced multiple times for a given font family and across multiple font families.
Attribute: tags
This tag is optional. If omitted, this font file is used when no styling is applied.
Values:
 b – indicates  bold tag
 i – indicates  italic tag
 b,i – indicates when both  bold and  italic tags are applied
