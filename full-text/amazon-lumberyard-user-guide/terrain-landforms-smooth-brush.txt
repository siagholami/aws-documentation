Using the Smooth Brush

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
The Smooth brush softens sharp gradients in the terrain, such as the sides of mountains, cliffs and lake beds for example. This brush averages out the height of the terrain based on nearby terrain areas to provide a smoother surface.

In the level, drag the mouse to create the smoothing effect.
