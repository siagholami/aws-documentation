Sky Clouds Gem
The Sky Clouds gem creates realistic and detailed cloud and weather effects in your game levels. You can create clouds with either simple, sprite-based shading, or more complex, voxelized 3D volume shading. 
To enable the Sky Clouds gem for your project, see Add modular features and assets with Gems. 
For more information about creating and placing clouds in your level, see Sky Cloud. 
For more information about working with clouds, including setting cloud shading parameters, adding 3D cloud shadows, and creating 3D cloud templates, see Adding Clouds.
