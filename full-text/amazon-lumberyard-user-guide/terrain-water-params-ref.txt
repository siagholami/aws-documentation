Advanced Water Volume Parameters

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
The following advanced parameters apply to water volumes.
To set advanced Water Volume parameters


In the Rollup Bar, on the Objects tab, click Area.


Under Object Type click WaterVolume.


Under WaterVolume Params\Advanced, adjust the following parameter values as needed:
FixedVolume
Traces a ray down to find a 'vessel' entity and 'spill' the requested amount of water into it. For static entities, it attempts to boolean-merge any surrounding static that intersects with the first vessel (use the No Dynamic Water flag on brushes that do not need that).
VolumeAccuracy
Water level is calculated until the resulting volume is within this (relative) difference from the target volume (if set to 0 it runs up to a hardcoded iteration limit).
ExtrudeBorder
Extrudes the border by this distance. This is particularly useful if wave simulation is enabled as waves can raise the surface and reveal open edges if they lie exactly on the vessel geometry.
ConvexBorder
Takes convex hull of the border. This is useful if the border would otherwise have multiple contours, which areas do not support.
ObjectSizeLimit
Only objects with a volume larger than this number takes part in water displacement (set in fractions of FixedVolume).
WaveSimCell
Size of cell for wave simulation (0 means no waves). Can be enabled regardless of whether FixedVolume is used.
WaveSpeed
Sets how "fast" the water appears.
WaveDamping
Standard damping.
WaveTimestep
This setting may need to be decreased to maintain stability if more aggressive values for speed are used.
MinWaveVel
Sleep threshold for the simulation.
DepthCells
Sets the depth of the moving layer of water (in WaveSimCell units). Larger values make waves more dramatic.
HeightLimit
Sets a hard limit on wave height (in WaveSimCell units).
Resistance
Sets how strongly moving objects transfer velocity to the water.
SimAreaGrowth
If changing water level is expected to make the area expand, the wave simulation grid should take it into account from the beginning. This sets the projected growth in fractions of the original size. If wave simulation is not used, this setting has no effect.
