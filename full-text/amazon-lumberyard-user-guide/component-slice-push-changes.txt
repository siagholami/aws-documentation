Modifying a Slice and Saving Changes
If you modify an entity that is part of a slice instance, you create an override for that change. An override means that the slice instance has different component properties than its source slice. You can verify that a slice has overrides with the following:
 In the Entity Inspector, the components and the properties that differ from the source slice appear orange. For more information, see Entity Inspector.
 In the Entity Outliner, the entity appears orange and has a dot if a child slice has an override. For more information, see the Entity Outliner table.
Example
In the Entity Inspector, for this slice instance, the Mesh asset property is different from its source slice, so the component and the property name appears orange.   

In the Entity Outliner, the slice instances with overrides appear orange.  

You can then choose to save that override to all other slice instances. 
To save a slice override

In the viewport or the Entity Outliner, right-click the entity, choose Save slice overrides, and then select the slice. This saves the override to all other slice instances. The number of changes appears next to the slice. 
Note
You can also right-click the component property in the Entity Inspector and choose Save field override.
Example 

This shows a slice instance with eight total changes: one removal and seven updates.



To save multiple slice overrides, in the Entity Outliner or the viewport, select your entities, right-click and then choose Save slice overrides, Save slice overrides (Advanced).



In Save Slice Overrides – Advanced dialog box, for Property, select the changes that you want and then select the target slices to which you want to save the overrides. You can also select or deselect the following check boxes.
     Changed – Overrides to existing entities.
    Added – Added entities.
    Removed – Deleted entities.



When finished, choose Save Selected Overrides.


Note
To quickly save changes to a selected slice, select the slice and press AltS.
Because slices can be nested, you can save modifications to one or more levels of the nested slice hierarchy. To save changes to the top slice root in the hierarchy, select the root slice and press CtrlAltS.
