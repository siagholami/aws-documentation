Grouping Nodes
As your Script Canvas graphs grow in size, you can group nodes to logically organize parts of a script or reduce its visual complexity. Groups can be nested, named, and color-coded.
Creating and Managing Node Groups
To create a node group from existing nodes and/or node groups


Select the nodes that you want to group.


Right-click the graph and choose Group or New group.


Enter a name for the node group, and then press Enter.


To create an empty group
 Right-click an empty portion of the graph, and then choose New group. You can expand the group's borders and add nodes to it as you would on the main graph.
To collapse a group
 Do one of the following:
   Double-click the group.
   Right-click the group, and choose Collapse.
   In Node Inspector, select the Collapse Group option.
A collapsed group has a border with a dashed line.
To expand a group
 Do one of the following:
   Double-click the group.
   Right-click the group, and choose Expand.
   In Node Inspector, clear the Collapse Group option.

To edit the name of a group
 Do one of the following:
   Right-click the title bar of the expanded group, and choose Edit group title.
   In Node Inspector, in the Group Name box, edit the name.
To resize a group's borders to fit the contents of the group


To reduce empty horizontal space within the group, double-click the group's left or right border.


To reduce empty vertical space within the group, double-click the group's top or bottom border.


To ungroup a group
 Right-click the group, and choose Ungroup.
To delete a group
 Right-click the group, and choose Delete.
Note
Deleting a group removes all of the nodes in the group and their connections to other nodes outside of the group. If you want to remove the group container but keep its nodes and connections, choose Ungroup.
Enabling Groups as Bookmarks
To quickly navigate through the groups in your graphs, you can enable groups as bookmarks.
To bookmark a group


Select the group.


In Node Inspector, select Enable as Bookmark.


Customizing Groups
You can use the Node Inspector to customize the color of a group and to change the font settings of the group title.
To change the color of a node group


Select the node group.


In Node Inspector, do one of the following:
    If you know the RGB values that you want to use, enter them in the Group Color text box.
    Click the Group Color icon to use the Select Color dialog box.



In the Select Color dialog box, specify the color that you want to use. You can choose from basic colors, create a custom color, or click Pick Screen Color to choose a color on your screen with your pointer.



Click OK.


To change the font settings for the node group title


In Node Inspector, expand Font Settings.


Enter or choose the values that you want to use for the group title font. The changes that you make are immediately visible.
