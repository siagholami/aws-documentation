VR Preview
The VR Preview component, when added to an entity or spawned from a slice, creates a user-editable navigation mesh. The navigation mesh is used to define valid areas that users can teleport to. The VR Preview component sets up necessary dependencies for exploring or navigating a scene in virtual reality. This component contains no editable properties.
To use the VR Preview component


Create a new entity.


Open the Entity Inspector. Add the VR Preview component to the entity by clicking Add Component, VR, VR Preview.


A navigation mesh of 50x50x50 size is generated around the entity.

Save the entity to a slice.

Now you can drag the saved slice to another part of the level, and the navigation mesh will be generated around the entity.
The navigation mesh that is generated is a separate entity from the original entity. Lumberyard names the new nav mesh entity by appending _NavMesh to the original entity name. 
If you delete the original entity, the nav mesh entity continues to exist. However, if you delete the nav mesh entity, it won't be generated again.
