Game Startup Sequence
Compiled Lumberyard games start up in the following sequence:


The game reads the bootstrap.cfg file, which must contain the following information at a minimum: 
    Name of the game, and optionally, the name of the game DLL, if it differs from the game name.
    Whether or not to connect to the Asset Processor on startup or listen for an incoming connection instead.
    Whether or not to wait for an established connection before proceeding.
    Whether or not to enable the virtual file system (VFS), which allows you to read assets remotely from a connected computer instead of having to deploy them to the game device. This also is required for live reloading to function on non-PC operating systems.
    Which kind of assets to load. For example, you could configure the Android runtime to load es3 assets, or pc assets, or metal assets. This determines which directory the game looks in for the assets so that the appropriate directory is also used for VFS.


The lyconfig_default.xml file is read.


VFS is started and enabled. All file access then goes through the VFS system. Besides the bootstrap.cfg file, executable files, DLL files, and associated OS files, nothing else needs to be deployed to the device. Instead, they can all be accessed remotely.


The system_game OS_assets.cfg file is read, where assets are the assets specified in the bootstrap.cfg file.
