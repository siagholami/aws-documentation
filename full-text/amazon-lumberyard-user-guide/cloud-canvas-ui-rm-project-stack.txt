Working with Project Stacks
When you select the Project stack node in the Cloud Canvas Resource Manager navigation pane, the detail pane shows information about the AWS CloudFormation stack that Cloud Canvas is using. 

Note the following: 
 If you select a project stack node and no AWS profile is configured, Lumberyard prompts you to provide one. A profile is required for Lumberyard to display the status of your project’s resources. For more information, see Managing Cloud Canvas Profiles. 
 If you select the Project stack node when the project has not been initialized for use with Cloud Canvas, Lumberyard prompts you to initialize the project and create a project stack. For more information, see Initializing Cloud Canvas Resource Manager. 
Project Stack Status Table
The Project stack status table shows the status of the AWS CloudFormation stack that contains the resources used by your project's resource groups. 
This table has the following columns: 
Pending – Indicates when changes have been made to the local stack templates or code but not yet uploaded to AWS. Pausing your mouse pointer on a value in this column displays the reason why the change is pending. Following are the possible values: 
 Create – The stack is defined locally but has not been created in AWS.
 Update – The stack's template and/or Lambda function code has been changed locally but not yet uploaded to AWS.
 Delete – The stack has been removed from the local definitions but has not been deleted in AWS. If you are using a source control system, this status can indicate that a new stack has been added to the project. However, your local copy of the source control is out of date and doesn't contain the definition for the new stack.
  -- – No change is pending. 
Status – The status of the AWS CloudFormation stack. See Understanding Resource Status Descriptions for a description of the values this column can have. To see additional status information, pause your pointer on the status indicator. 
Created – The time the stack was created. 
Updated – The time the stack status was updated. 
ID - A truncated version of the AWS ID for the stack. To see the full ID, pause your pointer on the truncated ID. 
Upload Resources
Click Upload resources to start the process of modifying, creating, or deleting resources in AWS so that they match your local definitions of them. A dialog box shows the changes that will be applied.

The table of changes has the same columns as the stack resource status table but also includes a column for Impacts. If a change has the potential to affect the security of your project, the Impacts column contains the text Security. Before you can start an operation that has a security impact, you must select the option It is OK that this will impact resource SECURITY. Review any security changes carefully before you apply them. 
Similarly, before you can start an operation that deletes one or more resources, you must select the option It is OK that this will permanently DELETE resources. 
Stack Resources Table
The Stack resources table shows the status of the resources that your project is using. 
This table has the following columns: 
Pending – Indicates that changes have been made locally but not yet uploaded to AWS. Pausing your mouse on a value in this column displays the reason why the change is pending. Following are the possible values: 
 Create – The resource is defined locally but has not been created in AWS.
 Update – The resource has been changed locally but not yet uploaded to AWS.
 Delete – The resource has been removed from the local definitions but has not been deleted on AWS. If you are using a source control system, this status can indicate that a new resource has been added to the project. However, your local copy of the source control is out of date and doesn't contain the definition for the new resource.
  -- – No change is pending. 
Resource Name – The logical name of the resource. 
Type – The type of the resource (for example, a Lambda function, Amazon S3 bucket, or a custom resource). 
Status – The current condition of the resource. For a description of the possible status values, see Understanding Resource Status Descriptions. To see additional status information, pause your pointer on the status. 
Timestamp – The time of the most recent change. 
ID - A truncated version of the AWS ID for the stack. To see the full ID, pause your pointer on the truncated ID.
