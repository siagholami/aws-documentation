Audio Switch
The Audio Switch component provides basic Audio Translation Layer (ATL) switch functionality. With switches (and switch states), you can specify the state of an entity. The audio middleware interprets states, modifies the behavior of sounds, and plays the appropriate sounds.
Audio Switch Properties
The Audio Switch component has the following properties:
Default Switch
Enter the name of the audio switch to use by default. You can associate any audio switch with the entity.
Default State
Enter the name of the audio switch state to use by default. Use the Audio Controls Editor to assign the state to the switch. When this component is activated, the default switch is set to the default state.
EBus Request Bus Interface
