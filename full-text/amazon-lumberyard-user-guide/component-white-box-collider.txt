White Box Collider component

This feature is an experimental release and is subject to change. 
You can enable collision on white box meshes in Lumberyard by adding the White Box Collider component to an entity that has a White Box component mesh. The White Box Collider component supports collision layers and physics materials. It can be used with static and kinematic white box meshes. The White Box Collider component uses the white box mesh as the collision surface. Unlike the PhysX Collider component, there is no need to specify a collision shape or provide a PhysX mesh asset. 

In the animation above, the White Box Collider component is applied to a static White Box component. The White Box component can be edited and the changes tested for collision immediately. 

In the animation above, the door was created with White Box and animated with a script. Note When the White Box component is edited, the White Box Collider component automatically recognizes the changes to the mesh. You can then test the changes immediately. 
White Box Collider properties

*Collision Layer*
The collision layer that's assigned to the collider. For more information, see Collision Layers. 
*Collides With*
The collision group containing the layers that this collider collides with. For more information, see Collision Groups. 
*Physics Material - Library*
Set the physics material library for this collider. 
*Physics Material - Mesh Surfaces*
Choose a material from the physics material library for this collider. The material is applied to the entire white box entity. 
*Tag*
Set a tag for this collider. Tags can be used to quickly identify components in script or code. 
*Body Type
Select Static for non-moving entities. Select Kinematic for animated entities. 
The White Box collider must be set to Static to interact with the PhysX Character Controller*.
