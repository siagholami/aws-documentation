Launching the Game Project
Building your game project produces an .exe file in Lumberyard's file system.
To launch your project, open the executable file. The directory and file name are named according to the following conventions:
/dev/Bin64compiler.build mode/executable name.exe
Where:
 compiler
   vc141 – Visual Studio 2017.
   vc142 – Visual Studio 2019.
  build mode
   Debug – Built in debug mode.
   (None) – Built in profile mode.
   Performance – Built in performance mode.
   Release – Built in release mode.
 executable name – The executable_name specified in your project.json file. The file name typically mirrors the project name.
For example, if your project was configured with the following:
 Compiler: Visual Studio 2017
 Build mode: debug
 Executable name: SampleProjectLauncher
Then your directory and file name would be the following:
 lumberyard_version/dev/Bin64vc141.Debug/SampleProjectLauncher.exe
