This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
The Samples Project includes two collections of sample levels and code that demonstrates how to use various Lumberyard features. 
The Samples Project's level files are located in the lumberyard_version\dev\SamplesProject\Levels directory.
The Samples subdirectory contains the following levels:
 Advanced Rin Locomotion
 Audio Sample
 Fur Technical Sample
 Metastream Sample
 Script Canvas Sample
 Scripted Entity Tweener Sample
 Simple Jack Locomotion
The UI subdirectory contains the following levels:
 UI Features – Demonstrates UI components, UI animation, font rendering, language support and localization, and C canvases and custom components.

Audio Sample
This sample demonstrates how to use the Audio Trigger and Audio Rtpc components with Lua scripts to associate sounds of a door opening and closing.
This example is fully annotated within the Lua script of the level file. The following sounds are associated:
 Sounds
   Door open
   Door creak
   Door creak stop
   Door slam
 Rtpc
   Creak volume
   Creak pitch
To play the example, do the following:
 Press W/S to swing the door.
 Press Q to open the door.
 Press E to open the door.
 Press the spacebar to open or close the door.
To see the Lua script, select the Door entity (a child of DoorTest) and then click the { } button next to the script property to open the Lua IDE.
