You can enable and disable effect groups with the Script Canvas editor or Lua scripting.
To enable or disable effect groups with Script Canvas

In the menu bar, choose Tools, Script Canvas.


In the Script Canvas editor, choose File, New Script.


Right-click the canvas, search and then select the following nodes: 
    On Graph Start
    Enable Effect Group or Disable Effect Group


For your script, do the following:


Select the Out pin for On Graph Start and drag to connect it to the In pin for the Enable/Disable Effect Group node. 


For the Group Name parameter, enter the file path for the group (for example, Libs\PostEffectGroups\MyEffectGroup.xml).



Save the script and attach it to an entity with the Script Canvas component. 


Close the Script Canvas editor.


Note
You can manually enable or disable an effect group in Lumberyard Editor by running the Lua functions in the Console window. To indicate a Lua command, prepend each command with the # character.
