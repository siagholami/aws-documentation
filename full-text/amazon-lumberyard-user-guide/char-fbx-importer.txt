Working with the FBX Settings Tool

FBX Settings is in preview release and is subject to change. 
You can use the FBX Settings tool to convert static FBX meshes, actors, PhysX, and motions into Lumberyard assets. 
When you export or copy .fbx files to a directory in your current game project, Asset Processor detects the new or modified .fbx files. Lumberyard calculates default settings from the .fbx files. These settings specify how Asset Processor automatically converts the files into the appropriate mesh, materials, or animation assets.
To open the FBX Settings tool


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools and then Asset Browser.


In the Asset Browser, right-click an .fbx file, and then choose Edit Settings.
