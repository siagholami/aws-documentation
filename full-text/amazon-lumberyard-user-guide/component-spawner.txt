Spawner Component Properties
The Spawner component has the following properties:
Dynamic slice
The slice to spawn.
Spawn on activate
If selected, the component spawns the selected slice, upon activation.
Default value: False
Destroy on deactivate
If selected, the component destroys any slices that it spawned, upon deactivation.
Default value: False
EBus Request Bus Interface
Use the following request functions with the Spawner component EBus interface to communicate with other components of your game.
For more information about using the Event Bus (EBus) interface, see Working with the Event Bus (EBus) system.
A SliceInstantiationTicket is the ID for the slice that spawns. You can use this ID with the Spawner component to interact with the entities that came from the spawned slice. For example, you can use the DestroySpawnedSlice function to destroy all entities from that spawned slice.
Spawn
Spawns the selected slice at the entity's location.
Parameters
None
Return
The ID of the spawning slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
Scriptable
Yes
SpawnRelative
Spawns the selected slice at the entity's location with the specified relative offset.
Parameters
offset – The coordinates to offset the slice when it spawns. 
Type: Transform
Return
The ID of the spawning slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
Scriptable
Yes
SpawnAbsolute
Spawns the provided slice at the specified world transform.
Parameters
world – The world coordinates.
Type: Transform
Return
The ID of the spawning slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
Scriptable
Yes
SpawnSlice
Spawns the selected slice at the entity's location.
Parameters
slice – The dynamic slice asset.
Return
The ID of the spawning slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
Scriptable
No
SpawnSliceRelative
Spawns the selected slice at the entity's location with the specified relative offset.
Parameters
slice – The dynamic slice asset.
offset – The coordinates to offset the slice when it spawns.
Type: Transform
Return
The ID of the spawning slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
Scriptable
No
SpawnSliceAbsolute
Spawns the selected slice at the specified world transform.
Parameters
slice – The dynamic slice asset.
world – The world coordinates.
Type: Transform
Return
The ID of the spawning slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
Scriptable
No
DestroySpawnedSlice
Destroys all entities from the slice that spawned. If the slice is not finished spawning, the slice is canceled. The Spawner component can destroy only slices that it spawned.
Parameters
ticket – The ID of the spawned slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
DestroyAllSpawnedSlices
Destroys all entities that the Spawner component spawned. Slices that are not finished spawning are canceled.
Parameters
None
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
GetCurrentlySpawnedSlices
Returns the IDs for spawned slices that are not yet destroyed. A slice is considered destroyed when all its entities are destroyed. The function also includes slices that have not yet finished spawning. This function returns only slices spawned by this Spawner component.
Parameters
None
Return
Type: Vector of SliceInstantiationTickets.
Scriptable
Yes
HasAnyCurrentlySpawnedSlices
Returns whether this Spawner component has spawned any slices, including any slices that are not yet destroyed. A slice is considered destroyed when all its entities are destroyed. Returns true if any slices have not yet finished spawning.
Parameters
None
Return
Type: Boolean
Scriptable
Yes
GetCurrentEntitiesFromSpawnedSlice
Returns the IDs of current entities from a slice that spawned. Note that spawning is not instant; if a slice is still spawning, then the entities are not returned. If an entity has been destroyed since it was spawned, its ID is not returned. This function can query only slices spawned by this Spawner component.
Parameters
ticket – The ID of the spawned slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
Return
Type: Vector of entity IDs.
Scriptable
Yes
GetAllCurrentlySpawnedEntities
Returns the IDs of all existing entities spawned by this Spawner component. Spawning is not instant; if a slice is still spawning, then entities are not returned. If an entity has been destroyed since it was spawned, its ID is not returned.
Parameters
None
Return
Type: Vector of entity IDs.
Scriptable
Yes
EBus Notification Bus Interface
Use the following EBus notification functions with the Spawner component to communicate with other components of your game.
For more information about using the Event Bus (EBus) interface, see Working with the Event Bus (EBus) system.
OnSpawned
Notifies that a slice finished spawning.
Parameters
spawnedEntities – Entities that the Spawner component spawned.
Type: Vector of entity IDs.
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
OnSpawnBegin
Notifies that the slice is beginning to spawn its entities.
Parameters
ticket – The ID of the spawned slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
OnSpawnEnd
Notifies that the slice finished spawning its entities.
Parameters
ticket – The ID of the spawned slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
OnEntitySpawned
Notifies that an entity spawned.
Parameters
ticket – The ID of the spawned slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
spawnedEntity – The entity ID.
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
OnEntitiesSpawned
Notifies that the entities spawned from a slice and sends a list of the entity IDs.
Parameters
ticket – The ID of the spawned slice.
Type: SliceInstantiationTicket
spawnedEntities – The IDs of the entities.
Type: A vector of entity IDs.
Return
None
Scriptable
No
OnSpawnedSliceDestroyed
Notifies when a slice that spawned is destroyed. This occurs when all entities from a spawn are destroyed or when the slice fails to spawn.
Parameters
ticket – The ID of the spawned slice.
