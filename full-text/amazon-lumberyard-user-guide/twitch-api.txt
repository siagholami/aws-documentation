Twitch API
TwitchAPI is a Twitch-specific implementation of the BroadcastAPI interface that allows programmers and designers to make calls to Twitch's REST API from within Lumberyard. For more information, see Twitch-API.
To ensure the TwitchAPI feature functions properly, you must set the broadcast_ClientID console variable to use the application's client ID (provided by Twitch). For more information, see Generating and Setting a Twitch Client ID.
