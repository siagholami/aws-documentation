Volumetric Fog
Volumetric fog uses volume textures as a view-frustum-shaped voxel buffer to store incoming light and its properties. Volumetric fog supports regular light and sunlight with dynamic shadows, environment probes, ambient light, as well as variations in fog density. It also supports the application of volumetric fog with respect to opaque and transparent materials.
Example
In the following example, volumetric fog is disabled.  

Example
In the following example, volumetric fog is enabled.  

You can add the Fog Volume component to an entity to create fog effects. For more information, see the Fog Volume component.
You can specify how light components affect volumetric fog. For more information, see Light Component Fog Properties.
You can also use the Particle Editor to place a particle emitter in your level to add fog density to an area. For more information, see the Volume Fog and Volume Thickness parameters for the Advanced Attribute in the Particles Attributes Reference. 
To add localized nonvolumetric regions of fog, see Using Fog Volumes.
