Create content patches with Lumberyard

This tutorial is out of date for the new Starter Game project that shipped as part of Lumberyard 1.25. We're working to revise it and provide better, more comprehensive instructions. 
This tutorial demonstrates a bundling process designed to simulate a patch update to existing content. In this tutorial, you create a set of bundles that simulates a content patch. These bundles include the patch itself, and a new version of the software to distribute with the patch already in place. The update bundle contains only content that changed since the first set of bundles was created. This topic covers:
 Modifying an asset reference to reference a new asset that was not bundled previously.
 Creating an updated asset bundle that contains only updated or new assets.
 Running the new release build with new bundles.
Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you should have completed the Build and bundle assets for release in Lumberyard and Creating Multiple Asset Bundles tutorials. You should have:
 A bundled release of Starter Game located at %USERPROFILE%\StarterGameRelease
 The startergame_pc.assetlist file used to generate the starter game content bundle.
 The dlc_level2.seed seed list file used to generate the asset list for the level content bundle.
 The dlc_level2_pc.assetlist file used to generate the additional level content bundle.
Add a gem and modify the level
For this tutorial you'll modify the level2 level created in the previous tutorial. You'll also be adding a new asset-only gem to the Starter Game project, to demonstrate how to update auxiliary content in addition to pushing direct changes to a bundle.


Launch the Project Configurator, make sure that the Starter Game is selected, and select Enable Gems.



Search for the term primitive in the search bar. The Primitive Assets gem should appear in the results list. Select the checkbox to include it as part of the Starter Game, and then select Save.

Note
The Primitive Assets gem is an asset-only gem, so you aren't required to recompile any code for your game. If you were adding a gem with a code component, you would also need to rebuild both the profile and release portions of your game and distribute the new binaries as part of the patch. See the Build and bundle assets for release in Lumberyard for build instructions and where the release binaries need to be located. 


Open the Lumberyard Editor and then open level2 that you created in the previous tutorial.


Create a new entity in the level and assign it the _box_1x1.fbx mesh.


Right-click in the viewport, somewhere within the frustum of the camera, and select Create entity.


Search for _box_1x1.fbx in the Asset Browser.


Drag the _box_1x1.fbx mesh onto your newly created entity in the level.


If you need a visual refresher on the editor UI for these steps, see Creating Multiple Asset Bundles.


Save the level by selecting File > Save (Ctrl-S) from the main menu.


Export the level by selecting Game > Export to engine (Ctrl-E) from the main menu.


Close the Lumberyard Editor.


Recreate the project bundles
In this step you'll version your old asset lists, generate new asset lists based on the changes to the level, and create two content packs: One for distributing to existing versions of the game as a patch, and one for directly downloading the latest version. 
Note
 For most game updates, only the content of your game assets will change. When upgrading to a new version of Lumberyard and pushing an update, you should regenerate all of the existing content to ensure it's properly updated, including the engine assets and auxiliary content. 


Open a console and navigate to the Lumberyard root directory at lumberyard_dir\dev.


Add a version identifier to the existing dlc_level2_all_pc.assetlist asset list:


move dlc_level2_all_pc.assetlist dlc_level2_v1_all_pc.assetlist

Generate a new asset list dlc_level2_v2_all_pc.assetlist from the dlc_level2.seed file:

Bin64vc141\AssetBundlerBatch.exe assetLists --seedListFile dlc_level2.seed --assetListFile dlc_level2_v2_all.assetlist
Note
 You don't need to update the dlc_level2.seed file here because only the dependences of the level have changed - nothing about the asset itself that's used as the seed. 

Get the delta of the assets between the v1 and v2 contents. Taking a delta gets everything that's changed between the two versions and generates a patch:

Bin64vc141\AssetBundlerBatch.exe compare --comparisonType delta ^
       --firstAssetFile dlc_level2_v1_all_pc.assetlist ^
       --secondAssetFile dlc_level2_v2_all_pc.assetlist ^
       --output dlc_level2_v1_to_v2_patch.assetlist

Remove starter game and engine assets from the dlc_level2_v2_all_pc.assetlist and generate a new asset list with only the latest required level2 assets:

Bin64vc141\AssetBundlerBatch.exe compare --comparisonType complement ^
       --firstAssetFile startergame_pc.assetlist ^
       --secondAssetFile dlc_level2_v2_all_pc.assetlist ^
       --output dlc_level2_v2.assetlist
   Bin64vc141\AssetBundlerBatch.exe compare --comparisonType complement ^
       --firstAssetFile engine_pc.assetlist ^
       --secondAssetFile dlc_level2_v2_pc.assetlist ^
       --output dlc_level2_v2.assetlist ^
       --allowOverwrites

Create two new bundles, one for the patch and one for the new full distribution:

Bin64vc141\AssetBundlerBatch.exe bundles --assetListFile dlc_level2_v1_to_v2_patch.assetlist --outputBundlePath dlc_level2_v1_to_v2_patch.pak
   Bin64vc141\AssetBundlerBatch.exe bundles --assetListFile dlc_level2_v2_pc.assetlist --outputBundlePath dlc_level2_v2.pak
Important
 Don't copy either of these files to the release folder yet. The next section will cover testing each bundle to make sure that it contains the correct content, and that they load correctly. 
Simulate user scenarios
Now you're ready to simulate two scenarios: users who have v1 of your game but upgrade to v2, and users who download v2 for the first time.
Simulate the v1 to v2 patch experience


Open a console and navigate to the Lumberyard root directory.


Copy the content patch to your release:


copy dlc_level2_v1_to_v2_patch_pc.pak %USERPROFILE%\StarterGameRelease\startergame

Launch the starter game and check to see if the new 1x1 box appears in the level2 scene.

%USERPROFILE%\StarterGameRelease\release\StarterGameLauncher.exe map level2
If the content patch was applied successfully, you should see a scene similar to the following:

Simulate the v2 download experience

Delete the content patch and v1 data from your game release:

del %USERPROFILE%\StarterGameRelease\startergame\dlc_level2_v1_to_v2_patch_pc.pak
   del %USERPROFILE%\StarterGameRelease\startergame\dlc_level2_pc.pak

Copy the level2 v2 content to the release:

copy dlc_level2_v2_pc.pak %USERPROFILE%\StarterGameRelease\startergame

Launch the starter game and check to see if the new 1x1 box appears in the level2 scene.

%USERPROFILE%\StarterGameRelease\release\StarterGameLauncher.exe map level2
Conclusion
You've learned how to generate a content patch to apply to an existing game. Now you know the general steps for distributing additional content and patches for your Lumberyard game:
 Create a complete asset list using your newly created or updated content as a seed.
 Take the complement of this asset list from the original game assets and engine assets, to get only the assets needed by your new content.
 When you patch existing content, take the delta of the patch asset list against the asset list for the content you're applying the patch to.
