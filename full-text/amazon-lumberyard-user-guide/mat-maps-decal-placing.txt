Placing a Decal

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
Do the following to place a decal in your level.
Note
If you apply decals to an object that can be moved by a player, the decal will not move with the object.
To place a decal


In Lumberyard Editor, click the top Follow Terrain button.


In Rollup Bar, click Objects, Misc, Decal.


Drag the detail into the level and then click to place it.


Using the Edit menu, move, rotate, or scale the decal as needed.


To place a decal manually, select the Reorientate check box, and use mouse shortcuts to place the decal as follows. This can speed up placement enormously.


CtrlClick: Move the decals to the desired position


AltClick: Scales the decal along the X, Y axes


CtrlAltClick: Rotates the decal around the z-axis


To place a decal on vegetation


Enable deferred projection so the decal follows the contours of the vegetation:


In Lumberyard Editor, in the Rollup Bar, under Objects, click Misc, Decal.


Under Decal Params, select the Deferred check box. For information about projection types, see Decal Projection Types.


Enable the r_deferredDecalsOnDynamicObjects console variable so the decal appears on the vegetation:


In Lumberyard Editor, click the X icon in the Console section.



In the Console Variables window, search for r_deferredDecalsOnDynamicObjects


Set the value to any positive number, for example 1.


Close the Console Variables window to save the new value.


Follow the instructions above for placing a decal.
