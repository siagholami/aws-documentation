Using AutoMerged Wind Bending Effects

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
Automerged vegetation has physically accurate wind motions that are defined by wind environment properties and various vegetation properties. It is recommended for use with grass only. 
Automerged vegetation reduces the number of draw calls while still allowing you to add any amount or size of grass patches to the terrain. It merges multiple meshes within several sectors as long as they are using the same material and texture. You can paint single grass blade objects on the terrain as well as on brushes in different heights independently while they get merged into larger chunks in real time.
When AutoMerged is enabled, touch bending, vertex colors, and detail bending settings are all ignored, and vegetation movement is defined solely by the AutoMerged parameters. For more information, see Adding Touch (Collision) Bending Effects and Adding Detail Bending Effects.
To enable AutoMerged vegetation and set parameters


In the Rollup Bar, on the Terrain tab, click Vegetation, Add Vegetation Object.


Expand Objects tree and select the grass object you want to modify.


Select the AutoMerged check box, and adjust the following parameter values:
    Stiffness – Defines the stiffness of the vegetation
    Damping – Specifies the amount of damping on the bending motion
    AirResistance–- Specifies the amount of bending similar to the Bending parameter used for Setting the Detail Bending Parameter.


The four AutoMerged parameters together define the amount and type of bending motions the vegetation object displays in reaction to wind and breezes. For more information, see, Adding Global Wind.
