Scripting in Amazon Lumberyard
Lumberyard includes two scripting technologies for automating gameplay: Script Canvas and Lua.
Script Canvas
A visual scripting environment that you can use to create game logic and behaviors without writing code. In the Script Canvas editor, you create, connect, and rearrange graphical nodes that provide a visual representation of the logic flow.
For more information, see Creating Gameplay with Script Canvas.
Lua
A powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. Lua facilitates quick iteration in your game project because you can run your changes immediately without needing to recompile your source code.
For more information, see Writing Lua Scripts.
Lumberyard's functionality is exposed to Script Canvas and Lua by the behavior context. For more information, see Behavior Context.
