Setting up a Dolby Voice Room whiteboard
The Dolby Voice Room whiteboard framing feature allows users to share drawings on any surface, such as a dry-erase whiteboard, with meeting participants. This requires a one-time setup process to register the position of the whiteboard with the Dolby Voice Camera.
The whiteboard configuration wizard lets you register the whiteboard position with the Dolby Voice Camera for optimal results. Before you start the setup process, we recommend that you draw something on the whiteboard and clearly mark all four corners. This lets you evaluate the quality of the setup.
To set up a Dolby Voice Room whiteboard


On the device, choose Settings, Device Settings, Dolby Voice Camera, and set the mode to Whiteboard.


Choose Configure whiteboard from the list of options.


Use the volume up/down button on the device to adjust the zoom and choose the check icon.


Use the controls on the device screen to drag the on-screen markers to the corresponding corners of your whiteboard.


When the anchor points on the large screen in the room, align to the corners of the whiteboard. Then choose the check icon to preview the frame.


Choose Save to save the configuration, or Change to make additional changes.
