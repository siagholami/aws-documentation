AWS::Batch::ComputeEnvironment
The AWS::Batch::ComputeEnvironment resource defines your AWS Batch compute environment. For more information, see Compute Environments in the AWS Batch User Guide.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::Batch::ComputeEnvironment",
  "Properties" : {
      "[ComputeEnvironmentName](#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeenvironmentname)" : String,
      "[ComputeResources](#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources)" : ComputeResources,
      "[ServiceRole](#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-servicerole)" : String,
      "[State](#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-state)" : String,
      "[Type](#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-type)" : String
    }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::Batch::ComputeEnvironment
Properties: 
  [ComputeEnvironmentName](#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeenvironmentname): String
  [ComputeResources](#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-computeresources): 
    ComputeResources
  [ServiceRole](#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-servicerole): String
  [State](#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-state): String
  [Type](#cfn-batch-computeenvironment-type): String
Properties
ComputeEnvironmentName 
The name for your compute environment. Up to 128 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
ComputeResources 
The ComputeResources property type specifies details of the compute resources managed by the compute environment. This parameter is required for managed compute environments. For more information, see Compute Environments in the AWS Batch User Guide.
Required: No
Type: ComputeResources
Update requires: No interruption
ServiceRole 
The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows AWS Batch to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf.
If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.
Depending on how you created your AWS Batch service role, its ARN may contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN does not use the service-role path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
State 
The state of the compute environment. If the state is ENABLED, then the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on queues.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: DISABLED | ENABLED
Update requires: No interruption
Type 
The type of the compute environment. For more information, see Compute Environments in the AWS Batch User Guide.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Allowed values: MANAGED | UNMANAGED
Update requires: Replacement
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the compute environment ARN, such as arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:555555555555:compute-environment/M4OnDemand.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Examples
Managed Compute Environment
The following example creates a managed compute environment called C4OnDemand that uses C4 On-Demand instances and a custom AMI.
