AWS::EC2::PlacementGroup
Specifies a placement group in which to launch instances. The strategy of the placement group determines how the instances are organized within the group. 
A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput. A spread placement group places instances on distinct hardware. A partition placement group places groups of instances in different partitions, where instances in one partition do not share the same hardware with instances in another partition.
For more information, see Placement Groups in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
