AWS::MediaStore::Container MetricPolicy
The metric policy that is associated with the container. A metric policy allows AWS Elemental MediaStore to send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. In the policy, you must indicate whether you want MediaStore to send container-level metrics. You can also include rules to define groups of objects that you want MediaStore to send object-level metrics for.
To view examples of how to construct a metric policy for your use case, see Example Metric Policies.
