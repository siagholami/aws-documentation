AWS::GameLift::MatchmakingRuleSet
The AWS::GameLift::MatchmakingRuleSet resource creates a new rule set for FlexMatch matchmaking. A rule set describes the type of match to create, such as the number and size of teams. It also sets the parameters for acceptable player matches, such as minimum skill level or character type. A rule set is used by a matchmaking configuration.

Examples
Create a Matchmaking Rule Set
The following example creates a matchmaking rule set for GameLift FlexMatch named MyRuleSet. The simple rule set defines a match with one team containing 1 to 20 players. In the YAML example, since RuleSetBody must be in JSON format, the !Sub command is used to specify JSON content within the YAML format.
