AWS::DynamoDB::Table GlobalSecondaryIndex
Represents the properties of a global secondary index.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "[IndexName](#cfn-dynamodb-gsi-indexname)" : String,
  "[KeySchema](#cfn-dynamodb-gsi-keyschema)" : [ KeySchema, ... ],
  "[Projection](#cfn-dynamodb-gsi-projection)" : Projection,
  "[ProvisionedThroughput](#cfn-dynamodb-gsi-provisionedthroughput)" : ProvisionedThroughput
}
YAML
[IndexName](#cfn-dynamodb-gsi-indexname): String
  [KeySchema](#cfn-dynamodb-gsi-keyschema): 
    - KeySchema
  [Projection](#cfn-dynamodb-gsi-projection): 
    Projection
  [ProvisionedThroughput](#cfn-dynamodb-gsi-provisionedthroughput):

Properties
IndexName 
The name of the global secondary index. The name must be unique among all other indexes on this table.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 3
Maximum: 255
Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9_.-]
Update requires: No interruption
KeySchema 
The complete key schema for a global secondary index, which consists of one or more pairs of attribute names and key types:
  HASH - partition key
  RANGE - sort key
The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attribute. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.
The sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.
Required: Yes
Type: List of KeySchema
Maximum: 2
Update requires: No interruption
Projection 
Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the global secondary index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. 
Required: Yes
Type: Projection
Update requires: No interruption
ProvisionedThroughput 
Represents the provisioned throughput settings for the specified global secondary index.
For current minimum and maximum provisioned throughput values, see Service, Account, and Table Quotas in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
Required: No
