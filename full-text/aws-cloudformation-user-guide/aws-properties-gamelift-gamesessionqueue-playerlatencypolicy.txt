AWS::GameLift::GameSessionQueue PlayerLatencyPolicy
The queue setting that determines the highest latency allowed for individual players when placing a game session. When a latency policy is in force, a game session cannot be placed with any fleet in a Region where a player reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are only enforced when the placement request contains player latency information.

  "[MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds](#cfn-gamelift-gamesessionqueue-playerlatencypolicy-maximumindividualplayerlatencymilliseconds)" : Integer,
  "[PolicyDurationSeconds](#cfn-gamelift-gamesessionqueue-playerlatencypolicy-policydurationseconds)" : Integer
}
YAML
[MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds](#cfn-gamelift-gamesessionqueue-playerlatencypolicy-maximumindividualplayerlatencymilliseconds): Integer
  [PolicyDurationSeconds](#cfn-gamelift-gamesessionqueue-playerlatencypolicy-policydurationseconds): Integer
Properties
MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds 
The maximum latency value that is allowed for any player, in milliseconds. All policies must have a value set for this property.
