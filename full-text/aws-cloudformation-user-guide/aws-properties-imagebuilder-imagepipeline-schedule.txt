AWS::ImageBuilder::ImagePipeline Schedule
A schedule configures how often and when a pipeline will automatically create a new image. 
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "[PipelineExecutionStartCondition](#cfn-imagebuilder-imagepipeline-schedule-pipelineexecutionstartcondition)" : String,
  "[ScheduleExpression](#cfn-imagebuilder-imagepipeline-schedule-scheduleexpression)" : String
}
YAML
[PipelineExecutionStartCondition](#cfn-imagebuilder-imagepipeline-schedule-pipelineexecutionstartcondition): String
  [ScheduleExpression](#cfn-imagebuilder-imagepipeline-schedule-scheduleexpression): String
Properties
PipelineExecutionStartCondition 
The condition configures when the pipeline should trigger a new image build. When the pipelineExecutionStartCondition is set to EXPRESSION_MATCH_AND_DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_AVAILABLE, and you use semantic version filters on the source image or components in your image recipe, EC2 Image Builder will build a new image only when there are new versions of the image or components in your recipe that match the semantic version filter. When it is set to EXPRESSION_MATCH_ONLY, it will build a new image every time the CRON expression matches the current time. For semantic version syntax, see CreateComponent in the * EC2 Image Builder API Reference.

Allowed values: EXPRESSION_MATCH_AND_DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_AVAILABLE | EXPRESSION_MATCH_ONLY
