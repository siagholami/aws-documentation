Viewing deleted stacks on the AWS CloudFormation console
By default, the AWS CloudFormation console does not display stacks with a status of DELETE_COMPLETE. To display information about deleted stacks, you must change the stack view.
To view deleted stacks
 On the Stacks page of the CloudFormation console, select Deleted from the filter list.

AWS CloudFormation lists all of your deleted stacks (stacks with a status of DELETE_COMPLETE).
