AWS::EC2::EIP
Specifies an Elastic IP (EIP) address and can, optionally, associate it with an Amazon EC2 instance.
You can allocate an Elastic IP address from an address pool owned by AWS or from an address pool created from a public IPv4 address range that you have brought to AWS for use with your AWS resources using bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP). For more information, see Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
[EC2-VPC] If you release an Elastic IP address, you might be able to recover it. You cannot recover an Elastic IP address that you released after it is allocated to another AWS account. You cannot recover an Elastic IP address for EC2-Classic. To attempt to recover an Elastic IP address that you released, specify it in this operation.
An Elastic IP address is for use either in the EC2-Classic platform or in a VPC. By default, you can allocate 5 Elastic IP addresses for EC2-Classic per Region and 5 Elastic IP addresses for EC2-VPC per Region.
For more information, see Elastic IP Addresses in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::EC2::EIP",
  "Properties" : {
      "[Domain](#cfn-ec2-eip-domain)" : String,
      "[InstanceId](#cfn-ec2-eip-instanceid)" : String,
      "[PublicIpv4Pool](#cfn-ec2-eip-publicipv4pool)" : String,
      "[Tags](#cfn-ec2-eip-tags)" : [ [Tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html), ... ]
    }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::EC2::EIP
Properties: 
  [Domain](#cfn-ec2-eip-domain): String
  [InstanceId](#cfn-ec2-eip-instanceid): String
  [PublicIpv4Pool](#cfn-ec2-eip-publicipv4pool): String
  [Tags](#cfn-ec2-eip-tags):

Properties
Domain 
Indicates whether the Elastic IP address is for use with instances in a VPC or instance in EC2-Classic.
Default: If the Region supports EC2-Classic, the default is standard. Otherwise, the default is vpc.
Use when allocating an address for use with a VPC if the Region supports EC2-Classic.
If you define an Elastic IP address and associate it with a VPC that is defined in the same template, you must declare a dependency on the VPC-gateway attachment by using the  DependsOn Attribute on this resource.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: standard | vpc
Update requires: Replacement
InstanceId 
The ID of the instance.
Updates to the InstanceId property may require some interruptions. Updates on an EIP reassociates the address on its associated resource.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Some interruptions
PublicIpv4Pool 
The ID of an address pool that you own. Use this parameter to let Amazon EC2 select an address from the address pool.
Updates to the PublicIpv4Pool property may require some interruptions. Updates on an EIP reassociates the address on its associated resource.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Some interruptions
Tags 
Any tags assigned to the Elastic IP address.
Updates to the Tags property may require some interruptions. Updates on an EIP reassociates the address on its associated resource.
Required: No
Type: List of Tag
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the Elastic IP address.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

AllocationId 
The ID that AWS assigns to represent the allocation of the address for use with Amazon VPC. This is returned only for VPC elastic IP addresses. For example, eipalloc-5723d13e.
