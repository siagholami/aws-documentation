Properties
AvailabilityZone 
The Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
EbsOptimized 
Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports EBS-optimized instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS- optimized instance.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: Replacement
EndDate 
The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to expired when it reaches its end date and time.
You must provide an EndDate value if EndDateType is limited. Omit EndDate if EndDateType is unlimited.
If the EndDateType is limited, the Capacity Reservation is cancelled within an hour from the specified time. For example, if you specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the Capacity Reservation is guaranteed to end between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
EndDateType 
Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:
  unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you explicitly cancel it. Do not provide an EndDate if the EndDateType is unlimited.
  limited - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time. You must provide an EndDate value if the EndDateType value is limited.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: limited | unlimited
Update requires: No interruption
EphemeralStorage 
Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports instances with temporary, block-level storage.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: Replacement
InstanceCount 
The number of instances for which to reserve capacity.
Required: Yes
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
InstanceMatchCriteria 
Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:
  open - The Capacity Reservation automatically matches all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes run in the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.
  targeted - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity. 
Default: open 
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: open | targeted
Update requires: Replacement
InstancePlatform 
The type of operating system for which to reserve capacity.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Allowed values: Linux with SQL Server Enterprise | Linux with SQL Server Standard | Linux with SQL Server Web | Linux/UNIX | Red Hat Enterprise Linux | SUSE Linux | Windows | Windows with SQL Server | Windows with SQL Server Enterprise | Windows with SQL Server Standard | Windows with SQL Server Web
Update requires: Replacement
InstanceType 
The instance type for which to reserve capacity. For more information, see Instance Types in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
TagSpecifications 
The tags to apply to the Capacity Reservation during launch.
Required: No
Type: List of TagSpecification
Update requires: Replacement
Tenancy 
Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:
  default - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is shared with other AWS accounts.
  dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single AWS account.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: dedicated | default
Update requires: Replacement
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the resource ID, such as cr-1234ab5cd6789e0f1.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

AvailabilityZone 
Returns the Availability Zone in which the capacity is reserved. For example: us-east-1a.
AvailableInstanceCount 
Returns the remaining capacity, which indicates the number of instances that can be launched in the Capacity Reservation. For example: 9.
InstanceType 
Returns the type of instance for which the capacity is reserved. For example: m4.large.
Tenancy 
Returns the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. For example: dedicated.
TotalInstanceCount 
Returns the total number of instances for which the Capacity Reservation reserves capacity. For example: 15.
