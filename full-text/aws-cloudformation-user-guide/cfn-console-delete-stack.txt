Deleting a stack on the AWS CloudFormation console
To delete a stack


Open the AWS CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation.


On the Stacks page in the CloudFormation console, select the stack that you want to delete. The stack must be currently running.


In the stack details pane, choose Delete.


Select Delete stack when prompted.
Note
After stack deletion has begun, you cannot abort it. The stack proceeds to the DELETE_IN_PROGRESS state.


After the stack deletion is complete, the stack will be in the DELETE_COMPLETE state. Stacks in the DELETE_COMPLETE state are not displayed in the AWS CloudFormation console by default. To display deleted stacks, you must change the stack view filter as described in Viewing deleted stacks on the AWS CloudFormation consoleViewing deleted stacks.
If the delete failed, the stack will be in the DELETE_FAILED state. For solutions, see the Delete stack fails troubleshooting topic.
For information on protecting stacks from being accidentally deleted see Protecting a stack from being deleted.
