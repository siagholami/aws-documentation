Properties
Description 
A user-defined, long-form description text for the machine learning transform.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
GlueVersion 
This value determines which version of AWS Glue this machine learning transform is compatible with. Glue 1.0 is recommended for most customers. If the value is not set, the Glue compatibility defaults to Glue 0.9. For more information, see AWS Glue Versions in the developer guide.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
InputRecordTables 
A list of AWS Glue table definitions used by the transform.
Required: Yes
Type: InputRecordTables
Update requires: Replacement
MaxCapacity 
The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) that are allocated to task runs for this transform. You can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the AWS Glue pricing page. 
MaxCapacity is a mutually exclusive option with NumberOfWorkers and WorkerType.
 If either NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType is set, then MaxCapacity cannot be set.
 If MaxCapacity is set then neither NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType can be set.
 If WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice versa).
 MaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.
When the WorkerType field is set to a value other than Standard, the MaxCapacity field is set automatically and becomes read-only.
Required: No
Type: Double
Update requires: No interruption
MaxRetries 
The maximum number of times to retry after an MLTaskRun of the machine learning transform fails.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
Name 
A user-defined name for the machine learning transform. Names are required to be unique. Name is optional:
 If you supply Name, the stack cannot be repeatedly created.
 If Name is not provided, a randomly generated name will be used instead.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
NumberOfWorkers 
The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated when a task of the transform runs.
If WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice versa).
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
Role 
The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role with the required permissions. The required permissions include both AWS Glue service role permissions to AWS Glue resources, and Amazon S3 permissions required by the transform. 
 This role needs AWS Glue service role permissions to allow access to resources in AWS Glue. See Attach a Policy to IAM Users That Access AWS Glue.
 This role needs permission to your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) sources, targets, temporary directory, scripts, and any libraries used by the task run for this transform.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Tags 
The tags to use with this machine learning transform. You may use tags to limit access to the machine learning transform. For more information about tags in AWS Glue, see AWS Tags in AWS Glue in the developer guide.
Required: No
Type: Json
Update requires: No interruption
Timeout 
The timeout in minutes of the machine learning transform.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
TransformParameters 
The algorithm-specific parameters that are associated with the machine learning transform.
Required: Yes
Type: TransformParameters
Update requires: No interruption
WorkerType 
The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a task of this transform runs. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.
 For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.
 For the G.1X worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.
 For the G.2X worker type, each worker provides 8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.
MaxCapacity is a mutually exclusive option with NumberOfWorkers and WorkerType.
 If either NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType is set, then MaxCapacity cannot be set.
 If MaxCapacity is set then neither NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType can be set.
 If WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice versa).
 MaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the transform ID.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
