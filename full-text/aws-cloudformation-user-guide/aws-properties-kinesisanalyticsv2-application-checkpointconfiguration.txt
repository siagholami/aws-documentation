AWS::KinesisAnalyticsV2::Application CheckpointConfiguration
Describes an application's checkpointing configuration. Checkpointing is the process of persisting application state for fault tolerance. For more information, see  Checkpoints for Fault Tolerance in the Apache Flink Documentation.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "[CheckpointingEnabled](#cfn-kinesisanalyticsv2-application-checkpointconfiguration-checkpointingenabled)" : Boolean,
  "[CheckpointInterval](#cfn-kinesisanalyticsv2-application-checkpointconfiguration-checkpointinterval)" : Integer,
  "[ConfigurationType](#cfn-kinesisanalyticsv2-application-checkpointconfiguration-configurationtype)" : String,
  "[MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints](#cfn-kinesisanalyticsv2-application-checkpointconfiguration-minpausebetweencheckpoints)" : Integer
}
YAML
[CheckpointingEnabled](#cfn-kinesisanalyticsv2-application-checkpointconfiguration-checkpointingenabled): Boolean
  [CheckpointInterval](#cfn-kinesisanalyticsv2-application-checkpointconfiguration-checkpointinterval): Integer
  [ConfigurationType](#cfn-kinesisanalyticsv2-application-checkpointconfiguration-configurationtype): String
  [MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints](#cfn-kinesisanalyticsv2-application-checkpointconfiguration-minpausebetweencheckpoints): Integer
Properties
CheckpointingEnabled 
Describes whether checkpointing is enabled for a Flink-based Kinesis Data Analytics application.
If CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType is DEFAULT, the application will use a CheckpointingEnabled value of true, even if this value is set to another value using this API or in application code.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
CheckpointInterval 
Describes the interval in milliseconds between checkpoint operations. 
If CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType is DEFAULT, the application will use a CheckpointInterval vaue of 60000, even if this value is set to another value using this API or in application code.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
ConfigurationType 
Describes whether the application uses Kinesis Data Analytics' default checkpointing behavior. You must set this property to CUSTOM in order to set the CheckpointingEnabled, CheckpointInterval, or MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints parameters.
If this value is set to DEFAULT, the application will use the following values, even if they are set to other values using APIs or application code:
  CheckpointingEnabled: true
  CheckpointInterval: 60000
  MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints: 5000
Required: Yes
Type: String
Allowed values: CUSTOM | DEFAULT
Update requires: No interruption
MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints 
Describes the minimum time in milliseconds after a checkpoint operation completes that a new checkpoint operation can start. If a checkpoint operation takes longer than the CheckpointInterval, the application otherwise performs continual checkpoint operations. For more information, see  Tuning Checkpointing in the Apache Flink Documentation.
If CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType is DEFAULT, the application will use a MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints value of 5000, even if this value is set using this API or in application code.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
