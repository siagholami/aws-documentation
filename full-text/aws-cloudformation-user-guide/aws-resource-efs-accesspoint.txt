AWS::EFS::AccessPoint
The AWS::EFS::AccessPoint resource creates an EFS access point. An access point is an application-specific view into an EFS file system that applies an operating system user and group, and a file system path, to any file system request made through the access point. The operating system user and group override any identity information provided by the NFS client. The file system path is exposed as the access point's root directory. Applications using the access point can only access data in its own directory and below. To learn more, see Mounting a File System Using EFS Access Points.
This operation requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:CreateAccessPoint action.

Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the resource ID. For example: 
{"Ref":"fsap-0123456789abcdef0"}.
Ref returns the access point ID.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

AccessPointId 
The ID of the EFS access point.
Arn 
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the access point.
