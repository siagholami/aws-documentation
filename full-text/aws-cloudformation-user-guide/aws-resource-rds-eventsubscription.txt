      "[Enabled](#cfn-rds-eventsubscription-enabled)" : Boolean,
      "[EventCategories](#cfn-rds-eventsubscription-eventcategories)" : [ String, ... ],
      "[SnsTopicArn](#cfn-rds-eventsubscription-snstopicarn)" : String,
      "[SourceIds](#cfn-rds-eventsubscription-sourceids)" : [ String, ... ],
      "[SourceType](#cfn-rds-eventsubscription-sourcetype)" : String
    }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::RDS::EventSubscription
Properties: 
  [Enabled](#cfn-rds-eventsubscription-enabled): Boolean
  [EventCategories](#cfn-rds-eventsubscription-eventcategories): 
    - String
  [SnsTopicArn](#cfn-rds-eventsubscription-snstopicarn): String
  [SourceIds](#cfn-rds-eventsubscription-sourceids): 
    - String
  [SourceType](#cfn-rds-eventsubscription-sourcetype): String
Properties
Enabled 
 A Boolean value; set to true to activate the subscription, set to false to create the subscription but not active it. 
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
EventCategories 
 A list of event categories for a SourceType that you want to subscribe to. You can see a list of the categories for a given SourceType in the Events topic in the Amazon RDS User Guide or by using the DescribeEventCategories action. 
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
SnsTopicArn 
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic created for event notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS when you create a topic and subscribe to it.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
SourceIds 
The list of identifiers of the event sources for which events will be returned. If not specified, then all sources are included in the response. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
Constraints:
 If SourceIds are supplied, SourceType must also be provided.
 If the source type is a DB instance, then a DBInstanceIdentifier must be supplied.
 If the source type is a DB security group, a DBSecurityGroupName must be supplied.
 If the source type is a DB parameter group, a DBParameterGroupName must be supplied.
 If the source type is a DB Snapshot, a DBSnapshotIdentifier must be supplied.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
SourceType 
The type of source that is generating the events. For example, if you want to be notified of events generated by a DB instance, set this parameter to db-instance. If this value isn't specified, all events are returned.
Valid values: db-instance | db-cluster | db-parameter-group | db-security-group | db-snapshot | db-cluster-snapshot 
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Some interruptions
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the name of the RDS event subscription.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Examples

The following example creates an event subscription for an existing database instance db-instance-1 and a database with the logical ID myDBInstance, which is declared elsewhere in the same template.
