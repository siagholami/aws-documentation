Properties
CreateAlias 
If set to true, specifies an alias for a directory and assigns the alias to the directory. The alias is used to construct the access URL for the directory, such as http://<alias>.awsapps.com. By default, this property is set to false.
After an alias has been created, it cannot be deleted or reused, so this operation should only be used when absolutely necessary.
