AWS::WAFv2::IPSet
Note
This is the latest version of AWS WAF, named AWS WAFV2, released in November, 2019. For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources from the prior release, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. 
Use an AWS::WAFv2::IPSet to identify web requests that originate from specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from a ranges of IP addresses, you can configure AWS WAF to block them using an IP set that lists those IP addresses. 
You use an IP set by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the rule statement IPSetReferenceStatement, when you add a rule to a rule group or web ACL. 
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::WAFv2::IPSet",
  "Properties" : {
      "[Addresses](#cfn-wafv2-ipset-addresses)" : [ String, ... ],
      "[Description](#cfn-wafv2-ipset-description)" : String,
      "[IPAddressVersion](#cfn-wafv2-ipset-ipaddressversion)" : String,
      "[Name](#cfn-wafv2-ipset-name)" : String,
      "[Scope](#cfn-wafv2-ipset-scope)" : String,
      "[Tags](#cfn-wafv2-ipset-tags)" : [ [Tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html), ... ]
    }

Properties
Addresses 
Contains an array of strings that specify one or more IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. AWS WAF supports all address ranges for IP versions IPv4 and IPv6. 
Examples: 
 To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32.
 To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify 192.0.2.0/24.
 To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128.
 To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to 1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64.

Scope 
Specifies whether this is for an AWS CloudFront distribution or for a regional application. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or an API Gateway stage. Valid Values are CLOUDFRONT and REGIONAL. 
For CLOUDFRONT, you must create your WAFv2 resources in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, us-east-1.
Required: Yes
Type: String

Tags 
Key:value pairs associated with an AWS resource. The key:value pair can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each AWS resource.
To modify tags on existing resources, use the AWS WAF console or the APIs. With AWS CloudFormation, you can only add tags to AWS WAF resources during resource creation. 
Required: No
Type: List of Tag

For example: my-webacl-name|1234a1a-a1b1-12a1-abcd-a123b123456|REGIONAL
Fn::GetAtt

Arn 
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IP set.
Id 
The ID of the IP set.
