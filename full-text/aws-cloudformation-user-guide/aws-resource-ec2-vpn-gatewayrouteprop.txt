AWS::EC2::VPNGatewayRoutePropagation
Enables a virtual private gateway (VGW) to propagate routes to the specified route table of a VPC.
If you reference a VPN gateway that is in the same template as your VPN gateway route propagation, you must explicitly declare a dependency on the VPN gateway attachment. The AWS::EC2::VPNGatewayRoutePropagation resource cannot use the VPN gateway until it has successfully attached to the VPC. Add a  DependsOn Attribute in the AWS::EC2::VPNGatewayRoutePropagation resource to explicitly declare a dependency on the VPN gateway attachment.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::EC2::VPNGatewayRoutePropagation",
  "Properties" : {
      "[RouteTableIds](#cfn-ec2-vpngatewayrouteprop-routetableids)" : [ String, ... ],
      "[VpnGatewayId](#cfn-ec2-vpngatewayrouteprop-vpngatewayid)" : String
    }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::EC2::VPNGatewayRoutePropagation
Properties: 
  [RouteTableIds](#cfn-ec2-vpngatewayrouteprop-routetableids): 
    - String
  [VpnGatewayId](#cfn-ec2-vpngatewayrouteprop-vpngatewayid): String
Properties
RouteTableIds 
The ID of the route table. The routing table must be associated with the same VPC that the virtual private gateway is attached to. 
Required: Yes
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
VpnGatewayId 
The ID of the virtual private gateway that is attached to a VPC. The virtual private gateway must be attached to the same VPC that the routing tables are associated with. 
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the ID of the VPN gateway.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Examples
VPN Gateway Route Propagation
The following example enables route propagation for the private route table named PrivateRouteTable .
JSON
"myVPNGatewayRouteProp" : {
   "Type" : "AWS::EC2::VPNGatewayRoutePropagation",
   "Properties" : {
      "RouteTableIds" : [{"Ref" : "PrivateRouteTable"}],
      "VpnGatewayId" : {"Ref" : "VPNGateway"}
   }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::EC2::VPNGatewayRoutePropagation
   Properties:
       RouteTableIds: 
        - !Ref PrivateRouteTable
       VpnGatewayId: !Ref VPNGateway
