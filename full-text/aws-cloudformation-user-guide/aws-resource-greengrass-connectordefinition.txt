AWS::Greengrass::ConnectorDefinition
The AWS::Greengrass::ConnectorDefinition resource represents a connector definition for AWS IoT Greengrass. Connector definitions are used to organize your connector definition versions.
Connector definitions can reference multiple connector definition versions. All connector definition versions must be associated with a connector definition. Each connector definition version can contain one or more connectors.
Note
When you create a connector definition, you can optionally include an initial connector definition version. To associate a connector definition version later, create an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-greengrass-connectordefinitionversion.html resource and specify the ID of this connector definition.
After you create the connector definition version that contains the connectors you want to deploy, you must add it to your group version. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-greengrass-group.html.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::Greengrass::ConnectorDefinition",
  "Properties" : {
      "[InitialVersion](#cfn-greengrass-connectordefinition-initialversion)" : ConnectorDefinitionVersion,
      "[Name](#cfn-greengrass-connectordefinition-name)" : String,
      "[Tags](#cfn-greengrass-connectordefinition-tags)" : Json
    }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::Greengrass::ConnectorDefinition
Properties: 
  [InitialVersion](#cfn-greengrass-connectordefinition-initialversion): 
    ConnectorDefinitionVersion
  [Name](#cfn-greengrass-connectordefinition-name): String
  [Tags](#cfn-greengrass-connectordefinition-tags): Json
Properties
InitialVersion 
The connector definition version to include when the connector definition is created. A connector definition version contains a list of https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-greengrass-connectordefinition-connector.html property types.
To associate a connector definition version after the connector definition is created, create an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-greengrass-connectordefinitionversion.html resource and specify the ID of this connector definition.
Required: No
Type: ConnectorDefinitionVersion
Update requires: Replacement
Name 
The name of the connector definition.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Tags 
Application-specific metadata to attach to the connector definition. You can use tags in IAM policies to control access to AWS IoT Greengrass resources. You can also use tags to categorize your resources. For more information, see Tagging Your AWS IoT Greengrass Resources in the AWS IoT Greengrass Developer Guide.
This Json property type is processed as a map of key-value pairs. It uses the following format, which is different from most Tags implementations in AWS CloudFormation templates.  
"Tags": {
    "KeyName0": "value",
    "KeyName1": "value",
    "KeyName2": "value"
}
Required: No
Type: Json
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the ID of the connector definition, such as 1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9. 
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

Arn 
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ConnectorDefinition, such as arn:aws:greengrass:us-east-1:123456789012:/greengrass/definition/connectors/1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9. 
Id 
The ID of the ConnectorDefinition, such as 1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9. 
LatestVersionArn 
The ARN of the last ConnectorDefinitionVersion that was added to the ConnectorDefinition, such as arn:aws:greengrass:us-east-1:123456789012:/greengrass/definition/connectors/1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9/versions/9876ac30-4bdb-4f9d-95af-b5fdb66be1a2. 
Name 
The name of the ConnectorDefinition, such as MyConnectorDefinition.
