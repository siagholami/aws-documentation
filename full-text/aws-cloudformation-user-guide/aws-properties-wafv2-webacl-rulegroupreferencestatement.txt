AWS::WAFv2::WebACL RuleGroupReferenceStatement
Note
This is the latest version of AWS WAF, named AWS WAFV2, released in November, 2019. For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources from the prior release, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. 
A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a RuleGroup. To use this, create a rule group with your rules, then provide the ARN of the rule group in this statement.
You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement, for example for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement. It can only be referenced as a top-level statement within a rule.
