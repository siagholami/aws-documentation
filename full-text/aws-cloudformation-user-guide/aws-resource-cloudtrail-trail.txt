Properties
CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn 
Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be delivered. Not required unless you specify CloudWatchLogsRoleArn.
Required: Conditional
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
CloudWatchLogsRoleArn 
Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to write to a user's log group.
Required: Conditional
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
EnableLogFileValidation 
Specifies whether log file validation is enabled. The default is false.
When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail will not create digest files for log files that were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
EventSelectors 
Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector for all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event.
You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.
Required: No
Type: List of EventSelector
Update requires: No interruption
IncludeGlobalServiceEvents 
Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global services such as IAM to the log files.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
IsLogging 
Whether the CloudTrail is currently logging AWS API calls.
Required: Yes
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
IsMultiRegionTrail 
Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current region or to all regions. The default is false. If the trail exists only in the current region and this value is set to true, shadow trails (replications of the trail) will be created in the other regions. If the trail exists in all regions and this value is set to false, the trail will remain in the region where it was created, and its shadow trails in other regions will be deleted. As a best practice, consider using trails that log events in all regions.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
KMSKeyId 
Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by "alias/", a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.
Examples:
 alias/MyAliasName
 arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
 arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
S3BucketName 
Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing log files. See Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
S3KeyPrefix 
Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more information, see Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files. The maximum length is 200 characters.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
SnsTopicName 
Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification of log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Tags 
An arbitrary set of tags (keyâ€“value pairs) for this trail.
Required: No
Type: List of Tag
Update requires: No interruption
TrailName 
Specifies the name of the trail. The name must meet the following requirements:
 Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.), underscores (_), or dashes (-)
 Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number
 Be between 3 and 128 characters
 Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like my-_namespace and my--namespace are invalid.
 Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
Return values
Ref
When the logical ID of this resource is provided to the Ref intrinsic function, Ref returns the resource name. 
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

Arn 
 When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the ARN of the CloudTrail trail, such as arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/myCloudTrail.
SnsTopicArn 
 When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the ARN of the Amazon SNS topic that's associated with the CloudTrail trail, such as arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:mySNSTopic. 
Examples
Example
The following example creates a trail that logs events in all regions, an Amazon S3 bucket where logs are published, and an SNS topic where notifications are sent. The bucket and topic policies allow CloudTrail (from the specified regions) to publish logs to the S3 bucket and to send notifications to an email that you specify. For information about CloudTrail bucket policies, see Amazon S3 Bucket Policy in the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
