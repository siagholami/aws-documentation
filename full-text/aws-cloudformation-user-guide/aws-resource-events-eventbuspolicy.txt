AWS::Events::EventBusPolicy
The AWS::Events::EventBusPolicy resource creates an event bus policy for Amazon EventBridge. An event bus policy enables your account to receive events from other AWS accounts. These events can trigger EventBridge rules created in your account. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
If you grant permissions using Condition and specifying an organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions when they use PutTarget to add your account's event bus as a target.
The permission policy on the default event bus can't exceed 10 KB in size.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::Events::EventBusPolicy",
  "Properties" : {
      "[Action](#cfn-events-eventbuspolicy-action)" : String,
      "[Condition](#cfn-events-eventbuspolicy-condition)" : Condition,
      "[EventBusName](#cfn-events-eventbuspolicy-eventbusname)" : String,
      "[Principal](#cfn-events-eventbuspolicy-principal)" : String,
      "[StatementId](#cfn-events-eventbuspolicy-statementid)" : String
    }
}

Type: AWS::Events::EventBusPolicy
Properties: 
  [Action](#cfn-events-eventbuspolicy-action): String
  [Condition](#cfn-events-eventbuspolicy-condition): 
    Condition
  [EventBusName](#cfn-events-eventbuspolicy-eventbusname): String

Properties
Action 
The action that you are enabling the other account to perform. Currently, this must be events:PutEvents.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 64
Pattern: events:[a-zA-Z]
Update requires: No interruption
Condition 
Condition is a JSON string that you can use to limit the event bus permissions that you're granting only to accounts that fulfill the condition. Currently, the only supported condition is membership in a certain AWS organization. For more information about AWS Organizations, see What Is AWS Organizations? in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
Condition is a property of the  AWS::Events::EventBusPolicy resource type.
If you specify Condition with an AWS organization ID and specify "*" as the value for Principal, you grant permission to all the accounts in the named organization.
Required: No
Type: Condition
Update requires: No interruption
EventBusName 
The name of the event bus to associate with this policy.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
Principal 
The 12-digit AWS account ID that you are permitting to put events to your default event bus. Specify "*" to permit any account to put events to your default event bus.
If you specify "*" without specifying Condition, avoid creating rules that may match undesirable events. To create more secure rules, make sure that the event pattern for each rule contains an account field with a specific account ID from which to receive events. Rules with an account field do not match any events sent from other accounts.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 12
Pattern: (\d{12}|\*)
Update requires: No interruption
StatementId 
An identifier string for the external account that you're granting permissions to. If you later want to revoke the permission for this external account, you must specify this StatementId.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 64
Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9-_]
Update requires: Replacement
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the event bus policy ID, such as EventBusPolicy-1aBCdeFGh2J3.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
