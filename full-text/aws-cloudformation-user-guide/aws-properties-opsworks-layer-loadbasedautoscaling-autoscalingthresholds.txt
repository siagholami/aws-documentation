AWS::OpsWorks::Layer AutoScalingThresholds
Describes a load-based auto scaling upscaling or downscaling threshold configuration, which specifies when AWS OpsWorks Stacks starts or stops load-based instances.

Properties
CpuThreshold 
The CPU utilization threshold, as a percent of the available CPU. A value of -1 disables the threshold.
Required: No
Type: Double
Update requires: No interruption
IgnoreMetricsTime 
The amount of time (in minutes) after a scaling event occurs that AWS OpsWorks Stacks should ignore metrics and suppress additional scaling events. For example, AWS OpsWorks Stacks adds new instances following an upscaling event but the instances won't start reducing the load until they have been booted and configured. There is no point in raising additional scaling events during that operation, which typically takes several minutes. IgnoreMetricsTime allows you to direct AWS OpsWorks Stacks to suppress scaling events long enough to get the new instances online.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 100
Update requires: No interruption
InstanceCount 
The number of instances to add or remove when the load exceeds a threshold.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
LoadThreshold 
The load threshold. A value of -1 disables the threshold. For more information about how load is computed, see Load (computing).
Required: No
Type: Double
Update requires: No interruption
MemoryThreshold 
The memory utilization threshold, as a percent of the available memory. A value of -1 disables the threshold.
Required: No
Type: Double
Update requires: No interruption
ThresholdsWaitTime 
The amount of time, in minutes, that the load must exceed a threshold before more instances are added or removed.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 100
Update requires: No interruption
