Delete a stack set
When you are finished with the AWS CloudFormation StackSets Getting Started walkthrough, you can follow procedures in this section to delete stack sets and other resources that you have created as part of this walkthrough. To delete a stack set, you must first delete all stack instances in the stack set. For information about how to delete all stack instances, see Delete stack instances from your stack set.
Delete a stack set using the AWS Management Console


On the StackSets page, select the stack set that you created in Create a stack set. In this walkthrough, we created a stack set named my-awsconfig-stackset.


With the stack set selected, choose Delete StackSet from the Actions menu.



When you are prompted to confirm that you want to delete the stack set, choose Delete StackSet.


Delete a stack set using the AWS CLI

Run the following command. When you are prompted to confirm, type y, and then press Enter.

aws cloudformation delete-stack-set --stack-set-name my-awsconfig-stackset

Verify that the stack set was deleted by running the list-stack-sets command. The results of the list-stack-sets command should show your stack with a status of DELETED.

aws cloudformation list-stack-sets
Delete service roles (optional)
Delete the service roles that StackSets required for stack set creation. For self-managed stack sets, the roles you created as part of the Prerequisites for stack set operations for the walkthrough in this guide are named AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole in the administrator account, and AwsCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole in each target account. For more information about deleting roles, see Deleting roles and instance profiles in the IAM User Guide.

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles, and then fill the check box next to the role that you want to delete.


In the Role actions menu at the top of the page, choose Delete role.


In the confirmation dialog box, choose Yes, Delete. If you are sure, you can proceed with the deletion even if the service last accessed data is still loading.
