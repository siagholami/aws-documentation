AWS::EMR::Cluster ScalingConstraints
ScalingConstraints is a subproperty of the AutoScalingPolicy property type. ScalingConstraints defines the upper and lower EC2 instance limits for an automatic scaling policy. Automatic scaling activities triggered by automatic scaling rules will not cause an instance group to grow above or shrink below these limits.

YAML
[MaxCapacity](#cfn-elasticmapreduce-cluster-scalingconstraints-maxcapacity): Integer
  [MinCapacity](#cfn-elasticmapreduce-cluster-scalingconstraints-mincapacity): Integer
Properties
MaxCapacity 
The upper boundary of EC2 instances in an instance group beyond which scaling activities are not allowed to grow. Scale-out activities will not add instances beyond this boundary.
Required: Yes
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
MinCapacity 
The lower boundary of EC2 instances in an instance group below which scaling activities are not allowed to shrink. Scale-in activities will not terminate instances below this boundary.
Required: Yes
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
