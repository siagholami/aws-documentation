Properties
Arguments 
A map of arguments used to configure the DevEndpoint.
Valid arguments are:
 "--enable-glue-datacatalog": ""
 "GLUE_PYTHON_VERSION": "3"
 "GLUE_PYTHON_VERSION": "2"
You can specify a version of Python support for development endpoints by using the Arguments parameter in the CreateDevEndpoint or UpdateDevEndpoint APIs. If no arguments are provided, the version defaults to Python 2.
Required: No
Type: Json
Update requires: No interruption
EndpointName 
The name of the DevEndpoint.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
ExtraJarsS3Path 
The path to one or more Java .jar files in an S3 bucket that should be loaded in your DevEndpoint.
You can only use pure Java/Scala libraries with a DevEndpoint.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
ExtraPythonLibsS3Path 
The paths to one or more Python libraries in an Amazon S3 bucket that should be loaded in your DevEndpoint. Multiple values must be complete paths separated by a comma.
You can only use pure Python libraries with a DevEndpoint. Libraries that rely on C extensions, such as the pandas Python data analysis library, are not currently supported.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
GlueVersion 
Glue version determines the versions of Apache Spark and Python that AWS Glue supports. The Python version indicates the version supported for running your ETL scripts on development endpoints. 
For more information about the available AWS Glue versions and corresponding Spark and Python versions, see Glue version in the developer guide.
Development endpoints that are created without specifying a Glue version default to Glue 0.9.
You can specify a version of Python support for development endpoints by using the Arguments parameter in the CreateDevEndpoint or UpdateDevEndpoint APIs. If no arguments are provided, the version defaults to Python 2.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
NumberOfNodes 
The number of AWS Glue Data Processing Units (DPUs) allocated to this DevEndpoint.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
NumberOfWorkers 
The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated to the development endpoint.
The maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for G.1X, and 149 for G.2X. 
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
PublicKey 
The public key to be used by this DevEndpoint for authentication. This attribute is provided for backward compatibility because the recommended attribute to use is public keys.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
PublicKeys 
A list of public keys to be used by the DevEndpoints for authentication. Using this attribute is preferred over a single public key because the public keys allow you to have a different private key per client.
If you previously created an endpoint with a public key, you must remove that key to be able to set a list of public keys. Call the UpdateDevEndpoint API operation with the public key content in the deletePublicKeys attribute, and the list of new keys in the addPublicKeys attribute.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
RoleArn 
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used in this DevEndpoint.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
SecurityConfiguration 
The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with this DevEndpoint.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
SecurityGroupIds 
A list of security group identifiers used in this DevEndpoint.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
SubnetId 
The subnet ID for this DevEndpoint.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Tags 
The tags to use with this DevEndpoint.
Required: No
Type: Json
Update requires: No interruption
WorkerType 
The type of predefined worker that is allocated to the development endpoint. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.
 For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.
 For the G.1X worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.
 For the G.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory, 128 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.
Known issue: when a development endpoint is created with the G.2X WorkerType configuration, the Spark drivers for the development endpoint will run on 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, and a 64 GB disk. 
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the endpoint name.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
