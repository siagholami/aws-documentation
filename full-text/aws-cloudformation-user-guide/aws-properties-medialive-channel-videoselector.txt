Properties
ColorSpace 
Specifies the color space of an input. This setting works in tandem with colorSpaceConversion to determine if MediaLive will perform any conversion.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
ColorSpaceUsage 
Applies only if colorSpace is a value other than Follow. This field controls how the value in the colorSpace field is used. Fallback means that when the input does include color space data, that data is used, but when the input has no color space data, the value in colorSpace is used. Choose fallback if your input is sometimes missing color space data, but when it does have color space data, that data is correct. Force means to always use the value in colorSpace. Choose force if your input usually has no color space data or might have unreliable color space data.
