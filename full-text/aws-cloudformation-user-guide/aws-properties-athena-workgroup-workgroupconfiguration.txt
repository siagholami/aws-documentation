AWS::Athena::WorkGroup WorkGroupConfiguration
The configuration of the workgroup, which includes the location in Amazon S3 where query results are stored, the encryption option, if any, used for query results, whether Amazon CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for the workgroup, and the limit for the amount of bytes scanned (cutoff) per query, if it is specified. The EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration option determines whether workgroup settings override client-side query settings.

Properties
BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery 
The upper limit (cutoff) for the amount of bytes a single query in a workgroup is allowed to scan.
This property currently supports integer types. Support for long values is planned.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration 
If set to "true", the settings for the workgroup override client-side settings. If set to "false", client-side settings are used. For more information, see Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled 
Indicates that the Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled for the workgroup.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
RequesterPaysEnabled 
If set to true, allows members assigned to a workgroup to reference Amazon S3 Requester Pays buckets in queries. If set to false, workgroup members cannot query data from Requester Pays buckets, and queries that retrieve data from Requester Pays buckets cause an error. The default is false. For more information about Requester Pays buckets, see Requester Pays Buckets in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
ResultConfiguration 
Specifies the location in Amazon S3 where query results are stored and the encryption option, if any, used for query results. For more information, see Working with Query Results, Output Files, and Query History.
