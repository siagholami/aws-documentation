Properties
Idle 
An object that represents an idle timeout. An idle timeout bounds the amount of time that a connection may be idle. The default value is none.
Required: No
Type: Duration
Update requires: No interruption
PerRequest 
An object that represents a per request timeout. The default value is 15 seconds. If you set a higher timeout, then make sure that the higher value is set for each App Mesh resource in a conversation. For example, if a virtual node backend uses a virtual router provider to route to another virtual node, then the timeout should be greater than 15 seconds for the source and destination virtual node and the route.
