Properties
AllocatedCapacity 
The number of capacity units that are allocated to this job.
Required: No
Type: Double
Update requires: No interruption
Command 
The code that executes a job.
Required: Yes
Type: JobCommand
Update requires: No interruption
Connections 
The connections used for this job.
Required: No
Type: ConnectionsList
Update requires: No interruption
DefaultArguments 
The default arguments for this job, specified as name-value pairs.
You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, in addition to arguments that AWS Glue itself consumes.
For information about how to specify and consume your own job arguments, see Calling AWS Glue APIs in Python in the AWS Glue Developer Guide.
For information about the key-value pairs that AWS Glue consumes to set up your job, see Special Parameters Used by AWS Glue in the AWS Glue Developer Guide.
Required: No
Type: Json
Update requires: No interruption
Description 
A description of the job.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
ExecutionProperty 
The maximum number of concurrent runs that are allowed for this job.
Required: No
Type: ExecutionProperty
Update requires: No interruption
GlueVersion 
Glue version determines the versions of Apache Spark and Python that AWS Glue supports. The Python version indicates the version supported for jobs of type Spark. 
For more information about the available AWS Glue versions and corresponding Spark and Python versions, see Glue version in the developer guide.
Jobs that are created without specifying a Glue version default to Glue 0.9.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
LogUri 
This field is reserved for future use.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
MaxCapacity 
The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be allocated when this job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory.
Do not set Max Capacity if using WorkerType and NumberOfWorkers.
The value that can be allocated for MaxCapacity depends on whether you are running a Python shell job or an Apache Spark ETL job:
 When you specify a Python shell job (JobCommand.Name="pythonshell"), you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The default is 0.0625 DPU.
 When you specify an Apache Spark ETL job (JobCommand.Name="glueetl"), you can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs. The default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a fractional DPU allocation.
Required: No
Type: Double
Update requires: No interruption
MaxRetries 
The maximum number of times to retry this job after a JobRun fails.
Required: No
Type: Double
Update requires: No interruption
Name 
The name you assign to this job definition.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
NotificationProperty 
Specifies configuration properties of a notification.
Required: No
Type: NotificationProperty
Update requires: No interruption
NumberOfWorkers 
The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated when a job runs.
The maximum number of workers you can define are 299 for G.1X, and 149 for G.2X. 
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
Role 
The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role associated with this job.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
SecurityConfiguration 
The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with this job.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Tags 
The tags to use with this job.
Required: No
Type: Json
Update requires: No interruption
Timeout 
The job timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters TIMEOUT status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours).
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
WorkerType 
The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.
 For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.
 For the G.1X worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.
 For the G.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory, 128 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the job name.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
