Properties
EncryptionConfiguration 
The encryption configuration for the query results.
Required: No
Type: EncryptionConfiguration

OutputLocation 
The location in Amazon S3 where your query results are stored, such as s3://path/to/query/bucket/. For more information, see Query Results If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the location for the query results and the encryption configuration that are specified for the workgroup. The "workgroup settings override" is specified in EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration (true/false) in the WorkGroupConfiguration. See EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration.
Required: No
Type: String

RemoveEncryptionConfiguration 
If set to "true", indicates that the previously-specified encryption configuration (also known as the client-side setting) for queries in this workgroup should be ignored and set to null. If set to "false" or not set, and a value is present in the EncryptionConfiguration in ResultConfigurationUpdates (the client-side setting), the EncryptionConfiguration in the workgroup's ResultConfiguration will be updated with the new value. For more information, see Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings.
