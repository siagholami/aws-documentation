Properties
CacheDataEncrypted 
Indicates whether the cached responses are encrypted.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
CacheTtlInSeconds 
The time-to-live (TTL) period, in seconds, that specifies how long API Gateway caches responses.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
CachingEnabled 
Indicates whether responses are cached and returned for requests. You must enable a cache cluster on the stage to cache responses.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
DataTraceEnabled 
Indicates whether data trace logging is enabled for methods in the stage. API Gateway pushes these logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
Required: No

Update requires: No interruption
HttpMethod 
The HTTP method. You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to apply method settings to multiple methods.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
LoggingLevel 
The logging level for this method. For valid values, see the loggingLevel property of the Stage resource in the Amazon API Gateway API Reference.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
MetricsEnabled 
Indicates whether Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled for methods in the stage.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
ResourcePath 
The resource path for this method. Forward slashes (/) are encoded as ~1 and the initial slash must include a forward slash. For example, the path value /resource/subresource must be encoded as /~1resource~1subresource. To specify the root path, use only a slash (/). You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to apply method settings to multiple methods.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
ThrottlingBurstLimit 
The number of burst requests per second that API Gateway permits across all APIs, stages, and methods in your AWS account. For more information, see Manage API Request Throttling in the API Gateway Developer Guide.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
ThrottlingRateLimit 
The number of steady-state requests per second that API Gateway permits across all APIs, stages, and methods in your AWS account. For more information, see Manage API Request Throttling in the API Gateway Developer Guide. 
Required: No
Type: Double
Update requires: No interruption
