Signing up for an AWS account and pricing
Before you can use AWS CloudFormation or any Amazon Web Services, you must first sign up for an AWS account.
To sign up for an AWS account


Open https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.


Follow the online instructions.


Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.
After signing up for an AWS account, you can use AWS CloudFormation through the AWS Management Console, AWS CloudFormation API, or AWS CLI.
Pricing
AWS CloudFormation is a free service; however, you are charged for the AWS resources you include in your stacks at the current rates for each. For more information about AWS pricing, go to the detail page for each product on http://aws.amazon.com.
