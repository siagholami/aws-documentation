AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm
The AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm type specifies an alarm and associates it with the specified metric or metric math expression.
When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to INSUFFICIENT_DATA. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed.
When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

Properties
ActionsEnabled 
Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm state. The default is TRUE.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
AlarmActions 
The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an ALARM state from any other state. Specify each action as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information about creating alarms and the actions that you can specify, see PutMetricAlarm in the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Maximum: 5
Update requires: No interruption
AlarmDescription 
The description of the alarm.
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 0
Maximum: 1024
Update requires: No interruption
AlarmName 
The name of the alarm. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the alarm name. 
If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 255
Update requires: Replacement
ComparisonOperator 
The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.
You can specify the following values: GreaterThanThreshold, GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold, LessThanThreshold, or LessThanOrEqualToThreshold.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Allowed values: GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold | GreaterThanThreshold | GreaterThanUpperThreshold | LessThanLowerOrGreaterThanUpperThreshold | LessThanLowerThreshold | LessThanOrEqualToThreshold | LessThanThreshold
Update requires: No interruption
DatapointsToAlarm 
The number of datapoints that must be breaching to trigger the alarm. This is used only if you are setting an "M out of N" alarm. In that case, this value is the M, and the value that you set for EvaluationPeriods is the N value. For more information, see Evaluating an Alarm in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
If you omit this parameter, CloudWatch uses the same value here that you set for EvaluationPeriods, and the alarm goes to alarm state if that many consecutive periods are breaching.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Minimum: 1
Update requires: No interruption
Dimensions 
The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify Dimensions. Instead, you use Metrics.
Required: No
Type: List of Dimension
Maximum: 10
Update requires: No interruption
EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile 
Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If ignore, the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If evaluate or this parameter is not used, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available.
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 255
Update requires: No interruption
EvaluationPeriods 
The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold. If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value specifies that number. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm, this value is the N, and DatapointsToAlarm is the M.
For more information, see Evaluating an Alarm in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Required: Yes
Type: Integer
Minimum: 1
Update requires: No interruption
ExtendedStatistic 
The percentile statistic for the metric associated with the alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100.
For an alarm based on a metric, you must specify either Statistic or ExtendedStatistic but not both.
For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify ExtendedStatistic. Instead, you use Metrics.
Required: No
Type: String
Pattern: p(\d{1,2}(\.\d{0,2})?|100)
Update requires: No interruption
InsufficientDataActions 
The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the INSUFFICIENT_DATA state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
Required: No
Type: List of String
Maximum: 5
Update requires: No interruption
MetricName 
The name of the metric associated with the alarm. This is required for an alarm based on a metric. For an alarm based on a math expression, you use Metrics instead and you can't specify MetricName.
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 255
Update requires: No interruption
Metrics 
An array that enables you to create an alarm based on the result of a metric math expression. Each item in the array either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression.
If you specify the Metrics parameter, you cannot specify MetricName, Dimensions, Period, Namespace, Statistic, ExtendedStatistic, or Unit. 
Required: No
Type: List of MetricDataQuery
Update requires: No interruption
Namespace 
The namespace of the metric associated with the alarm. This is required for an alarm based on a metric. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify Namespace and you use Metrics instead.
For a list of namespaces for metrics from AWS services, see  AWS Services That Publish CloudWatch Metrics. 
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 255
Pattern: [^:].*
Update requires: No interruption
OKActions 
The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the OK state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
Required: No
Type: List of String
Maximum: 5
Update requires: No interruption
Period 
The period, in seconds, over which the statistic is applied. This is required for an alarm based on a metric. Valid values are 10, 30, 60, and any multiple of 60.
For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify Period, and instead you use the Metrics parameter.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Minimum: 10
Update requires: No interruption
Statistic 
The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ExtendedStatistic.
For an alarm based on a metric, you must specify either Statistic or ExtendedStatistic but not both.
For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify Statistic. Instead, you use Metrics.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: Average | Maximum | Minimum | SampleCount | Sum
Update requires: No interruption
Threshold 
The value to compare with the specified statistic.
Required: No
Type: Double
Update requires: No interruption
ThresholdMetricId 
In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is the ID of the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND function used as the threshold for the alarm.
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 255
Update requires: No interruption
TreatMissingData 
Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. Valid values are breaching, notBreaching, ignore, and missing. For more information, see  Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms Treat Missing Data in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
If you omit this parameter, the default behavior of missing is used.
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 255
Update requires: No interruption
Unit

Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the alarm name, such as TestAlarm.

The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

Arn 
The ARN of the CloudWatch alarm, such as arn:aws:cloudwatch:us-west-2:123456789012:alarm:myCloudWatchAlarm-CPUAlarm-UXMMZK36R55Z.
