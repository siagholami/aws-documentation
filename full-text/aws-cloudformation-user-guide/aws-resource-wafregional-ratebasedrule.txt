AWS::WAFRegional::RateBasedRule
A RateBasedRule is identical to a regular Rule, with one addition: a RateBasedRule counts the number of requests that arrive from a specified IP address every five minutes. For example, based on recent requests that you've seen from an attacker, you might create a RateBasedRule that includes the following conditions: 
 The requests come from 192.0.2.44.
 They contain the value BadBot in the User-Agent header.
In the rule, you also define the rate limit as 15,000.
Requests that meet both of these conditions and exceed 15,000 requests every five minutes trigger the rule's action (block or count), which is defined in the web ACL.
Note you can only create rate-based rules using a CloudFormation template. To add the rate-based rules created through CloudFormation to a web ACL, use the AWS WAF console, API, or command line interface (CLI). For more information, see UpdateWebACL.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::WAFRegional::RateBasedRule",
  "Properties" : {
      "[MatchPredicates](#cfn-wafregional-ratebasedrule-matchpredicates)" : [ Predicate, ... ],
      "[MetricName](#cfn-wafregional-ratebasedrule-metricname)" : String,
      "[Name](#cfn-wafregional-ratebasedrule-name)" : String,
      "[RateKey](#cfn-wafregional-ratebasedrule-ratekey)" : String,
      "[RateLimit](#cfn-wafregional-ratebasedrule-ratelimit)" : Integer
    }
}

Type: AWS::WAFRegional::RateBasedRule

  [MatchPredicates](#cfn-wafregional-ratebasedrule-matchpredicates): 
    - Predicate
  [MetricName](#cfn-wafregional-ratebasedrule-metricname): String

Properties
MatchPredicates 
The Predicates object contains one Predicate element for each ByteMatchSet, IPSet, or SqlInjectionMatchSet> object that you want to include in a RateBasedRule.
Required: No
Type: List of Predicate
Update requires: No interruption
MetricName 
A friendly name or description for the metrics for a RateBasedRule. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the name of the metric after you create the RateBasedRule.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 128
Pattern: .*\S.*
Update requires: Replacement
Name 
A friendly name or description for a RateBasedRule. You can't change the name of a RateBasedRule after you create it.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 128
Pattern: .*\S.*
Update requires: Replacement
RateKey 
The field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are likely arriving from single source and thus subject to rate monitoring. The only valid value for RateKey is IP. IP indicates that requests arriving from the same IP address are subject to the RateLimit that is specified in the RateBasedRule.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Allowed values: IP
Update requires: Replacement
RateLimit 
The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in the field specified by the RateKey, allowed in a five-minute period. If the number of requests exceeds the RateLimit and the other predicates specified in the rule are also met, AWS WAF triggers the action that is specified for this rule.
Required: Yes
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the resource physical ID, such as 1234a1a-a1b1-12a1-abcd-a123b123456.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Examples
Associate an IPSet with a Rate-Based Rule
The following example associates the MyIPSetBlacklist IPSet object with a rate-based rule.
