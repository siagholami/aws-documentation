AWS::ApiGateway::Account
The AWS::ApiGateway::Account resource specifies the IAM role that Amazon API Gateway uses to write API logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
Important
If an API Gateway resource has never been created in your AWS account, you must add a dependency on another API Gateway resource, such as an AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi or AWS::ApiGateway::ApiKey resource.
If an API Gateway resource has been created in your AWS account, no dependency is required (even if the resource was deleted).
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::ApiGateway::Account",
  "Properties" : {
      "[CloudWatchRoleArn](#cfn-apigateway-account-cloudwatchrolearn)" : String
    }
}

  [CloudWatchRoleArn](#cfn-apigateway-account-cloudwatchrolearn): String
Properties

Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the ID of the resource, such as mysta-accou-01234b567890example.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Examples
Associate account with IAM role
