Properties
UsageStrategy 
Indicates whether to use unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On-Demand capacity.
If you specify use-capacity-reservations-first, the fleet uses unused Capacity Reservations to fulfill On-Demand capacity up to the target On-Demand capacity. If multiple instance pools have unused Capacity Reservations, the On-Demand allocation strategy (lowest-price or prioritized) is applied. If the number of unused Capacity Reservations is less than the On-Demand target capacity, the remaining On-Demand target capacity is launched according to the On-Demand allocation strategy (lowest-price or prioritized).
If you do not specify a value, the fleet fulfils the On-Demand capacity according to the chosen On-Demand allocation strategy.
