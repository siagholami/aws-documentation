AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm
The AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm type creates or updates a composite alarm. When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are met.
The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include metric alarms and other composite alarms.
Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state.
Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms are notifying SNS topics.
When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to INSUFFICIENT_DATA. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the only time that the alarm can be in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.
When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

Properties
ActionsEnabled 
Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm state of the composite alarm. The default is TRUE.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
AlarmActions 
The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the ALARM state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information about creating alarms and the actions that you can specify, see PutCompositeAlarm in the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
AlarmDescription 
The description for the composite alarm.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
AlarmName 
The name for the composite alarm. This name must be unique within your AWS account.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
AlarmRule 
An expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated to determine this composite alarm's state. For each alarm that you reference, you designate a function that specifies whether that alarm needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. You can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple functions in a single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the functions in your expression.
You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be evaluated.
Functions can include the following:
  ALARM("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in ALARM state. 
  OK("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK state. 
  INSUFFICIENT_DATA("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. 
 TRUE always evaluates to TRUE.
 FALSE always evaluates to FALSE.
 TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex AlarmRule structure, and for testing your alarm actions.
For more information about AlarmRule syntax, see PutCompositeAlarm in the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
InsufficientDataActions 
The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the INSUFFICIENT_DATA state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information about creating alarms and the actions that you can specify, see PutCompositeAlarm in the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
OKActions 
The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the OK state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information about creating alarms and the actions that you can specify, see PutCompositeAlarm in the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the alarm name, such as MyCompositeAlarm.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

Arn 
The ARN of the composite alarm, such as arn:aws:cloudwatch:us-west-2:123456789012:alarm/CompositeAlarmName.
Examples
Composite alarm based on two metric alarms and another composite alarm
This example creates composite alarms named "HighResourceUsage" and "DeploymentInProgress", and also creates metrics alarms named "HighCPUUsage" and "HighMemoryUsage". "DeploymentInProgress" is an alarm that must be manually set to TRUE or FALSE. The "HighResourceUsage" alarm goes into ALARM state only if both "HighCPUUsage" and "HighMemoryUsage" are in ALARM state, and if "DeploymentInProgress" is FALSE. Only "HighResourceUsage" has the alarm action of notifying SNS. This reduces alarm noise, so that you are alerted only if both CPU usage and memory usage are high, and a deployment is not currently in progress.
