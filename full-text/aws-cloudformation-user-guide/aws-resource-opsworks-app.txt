Properties
AppSource 
A Source object that specifies the app repository.
Required: No
Type: Source
Update requires: No interruption
Attributes 
One or more user-defined key/value pairs to be added to the stack attributes.
Required: No
Type: Map of String
Update requires: No interruption
DataSources 
The app's data source.
Required: No
Type: List of DataSource

EnableSsl 
Whether to enable SSL for the app.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
Environment 
An array of EnvironmentVariable objects that specify environment variables to be associated with the app. After you deploy the app, these variables are defined on the associated app server instance. For more information, see  Environment Variables.
There is no specific limit on the number of environment variables. However, the size of the associated data structure - which includes the variables' names, values, and protected flag values - cannot exceed 20 KB. This limit should accommodate most if not all use cases. Exceeding it will cause an exception with the message, "Environment: is too large (maximum is 20KB)."
If you have specified one or more environment variables, you cannot modify the stack's Chef version.
Required: No
Type: List of EnvironmentVariable
Update requires: No interruption
Name 
The app name.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Shortname 
The app's short name.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
SslConfiguration 
An SslConfiguration object with the SSL configuration.
Required: No
Type: SslConfiguration
Update requires: No interruption
StackId 
The stack ID.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
Type 
The app type. Each supported type is associated with a particular layer. For example, PHP applications are associated with a PHP layer. AWS OpsWorks Stacks deploys an application to those instances that are members of the corresponding layer. If your app isn't one of the standard types, or you prefer to implement your own Deploy recipes, specify other.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Allowed values: aws-flow-ruby | java | nodejs | other | php | rails | static
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the resource name. For example: 
{ "Ref": "myApp" } 
For the AWS OpsWorks stack myApp, Ref returns the ID of the AWS OpsWorks app.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
