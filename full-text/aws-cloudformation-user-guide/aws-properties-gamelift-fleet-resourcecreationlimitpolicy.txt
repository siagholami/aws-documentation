AWS::GameLift::Fleet ResourceCreationLimitPolicy
A policy that limits the number of game sessions a player can create on the same fleet. This optional policy gives game owners control over how players can consume available game server resources. A resource creation policy makes the following statement: "An individual player can create a maximum number of new game sessions within a specified time period".
The policy is evaluated when a player tries to create a new game session. For example, assume you have a policy of 10 new game sessions and a time period of 60 minutes. On receiving a CreateGameSession request, Amazon GameLift checks that the player (identified by CreatorId) has created fewer than 10 game sessions in the past 60 minutes.
