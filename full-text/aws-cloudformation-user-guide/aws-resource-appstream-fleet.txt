Properties
ComputeCapacity 
The desired capacity for the fleet.
Required: Yes
Type: ComputeCapacity
Update requires: No interruption
Description 
The description to display.
Required: No
Type: String
Maximum: 256
Update requires: No interruption
DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds 
The amount of time that a streaming session remains active after users disconnect. If users try to reconnect to the streaming session after a disconnection or network interruption within this time interval, they are connected to their previous session. Otherwise, they are connected to a new session with a new streaming instance. 
Specify a value between 60 and 360000.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
DisplayName 
The fleet name to display.
Required: No
Type: String
Maximum: 100
Update requires: No interruption
DomainJoinInfo 
The name of the directory and organizational unit (OU) to use to join the fleet to a Microsoft Active Directory domain. 
Required: No
Type: DomainJoinInfo
Update requires: No interruption
EnableDefaultInternetAccess 
Enables or disables default internet access for the fleet.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
FleetType 
The fleet type.  
ALWAYS_ON
Provides users with instant-on access to their apps. You are charged for all running instances in your fleet, even if no users are streaming apps.
ON_DEMAND
Provide users with access to applications after they connect, which takes one to two minutes. You are charged for instance streaming when users are connected and a small hourly fee for instances that are not streaming apps.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: ALWAYS_ON | ON_DEMAND
Update requires: Replacement
IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds 
The amount of time that users can be idle (inactive) before they are disconnected from their streaming session and the DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds time interval begins. Users are notified before they are disconnected due to inactivity. If they try to reconnect to the streaming session before the time interval specified in DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are connected to their previous session. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads and downloads, audio in, audio out, and pixels changing do not qualify as user activity. If users continue to be idle after the time interval in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.
To prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and 3600.
If you enable this feature, we recommend that you specify a value that corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don't do this, the value is rounded to the nearest minute. For example, if you specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after 1 minute of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between two different minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you specify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes of inactivity. 
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
ImageArn 
The ARN of the public, private, or shared image to use.
Required: No
Type: String
Pattern: ^arn:aws(?:\-cn|\-iso\-b|\-iso|\-us\-gov)?:[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_/.-]{0,62}:[A-Za-z0-9_/.-]{0,63}:[A-Za-z0-9_/.-]{0,63}:[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9:_/=,@.\\-]{0,1023}$

 stream.graphics-pro.16xlarge
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Update requires: No interruption
MaxUserDurationInSeconds 
The maximum amount of time that a streaming session can remain active, in seconds. If users are still connected to a streaming instance five minutes before this limit is reached, they are prompted to save any open documents before being disconnected. After this time elapses, the instance is terminated and replaced by a new instance.
Specify a value between 600 and 360000.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
Name 
A unique name for the fleet.
Required: Yes
Type: String
