AWS::EC2::Host
Allocates a fully dedicated physical server for launching EC2 instances. Because the host is fully dedicated for your use, it can help you address compliance requirements and reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses. For more information, see  Dedicated Hosts in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
