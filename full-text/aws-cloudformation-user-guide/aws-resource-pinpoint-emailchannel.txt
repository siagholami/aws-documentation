AWS::Pinpoint::EmailChannel
A channel is a type of platform that you can deliver messages to. You can use the email channel to send email to users. Before you can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, you must enable the email channel for an Amazon Pinpoint application.
The AWS::Pinpoint::EmailChannel resource defines the status, identity, and other settings of the email channel for an application.
