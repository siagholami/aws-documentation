AWS CloudFormation quotas
Your AWS account has AWS CloudFormation quotas that you might need to know when authoring templates and creating stacks. By understanding these quotas, you can avoid limitation errors that would require you to redesign your templates or stacks.
AWS CloudFormation quotas 



Quotas
Description
Value
Tuning strategy




cfn-signal wait condition data
Maximum amount of data that cfn-signal can pass.
4,096 bytes
To pass a larger amount, send the data to an Amazon S3 bucket, and then use cfn-signal to pass the Amazon S3 URL to that bucket.


Custom resource response
Maximum amount of data that a custom resource provider can pass.
4,096 bytes



Mappings
Maximum number of mappings that you can declare in your AWS CloudFormation template.
100 mappings
To specify more mappings, separate your template into multiple templates by using, for example, nested stacks.


Mapping attributes
Maximum number of mapping attributes for each mapping that you can declare in your AWS CloudFormation template.
64 attributes
To specify more mapping attributes, separate the attributes into multiple mappings.


Mapping name and mapping attribute name
Maximum size of each mapping name.
255 characters



Outputs
Maximum number of outputs that you can declare in your AWS CloudFormation template.
60 outputs



Output name
Maximum size of an output name.
255 characters



Parameters
Maximum number of parameters that you can declare in your AWS CloudFormation template.
60 parameters
To specify more parameters, you can use mappings or lists in order to assign multiple values to a single parameter.


Parameter name
Maximum size of a parameter name.
255 characters



Parameter value
Maximum size of a parameter value.
4,096 bytes
To use a larger parameter value, create multiple parameters and then use Fn::Join to append the multiple values into a single value.


Resources
Maximum number of resources that you can declare in your AWS CloudFormation template.
200 resources
To specify more resources, separate your template into multiple templates by using, for example, nested stacks.


Resources in concurrent stack operations
Maximum number of resources you can have involved in stack operations (create, update, or delete operations) in your region at a given time.
Use the DescribeAccountLimits API to determine the current limit for an account in a specific region.



Resource name
Maximum size of a resource name.
255 characters



Stacks
Maximum number of AWS CloudFormation stacks that you can create.
200 stacks
To create more stacks, delete stacks that you don't need or request an increase in the maximum number of stacks in your AWS account. For more information, see AWS service quotas in the AWS General Reference.


Stack name
Maximum size of Stack name.
128 characters



StackSets
Maximum number of AWS CloudFormation stack sets you can create in your administrator account.
100 stack sets
To create more stack sets, delete stack sets that you don't need or request an increase in the maximum number of stack sets in your AWS account. For more information, see AWS service quotas in the AWS General Reference.


Stack instances
Maximum number of stack instances you can create per stack set.
2000 stack instances per stack set
To create more stack instances, delete stack instances that you don't need or request an increase in the maximum number of stack instances in your AWS account. For more information, see AWS service quotas in the AWS General Reference.


StackSets instance operations
Maximum number of stack instances, across all stack sets, that you can run operations on in each Region at the same time, per administrator account.
3500 operations
This limit applies across all stack sets involved in a Region. It includes stack instances affected by stack set creation and update operations, as well as creating, updating, or deleting stack instances directly.


Template body size in a request
Maximum size of a template body that you can pass in a CreateStack, UpdateStack, or ValidateTemplate request.
51,200 bytes
To use a larger template body, separate your template into multiple templates by using, for example, nested stacks. Or upload the template to an Amazon S3 bucket.


Template body size in an Amazon S3 object
Maximum size of a template body that you can pass in an Amazon S3 object for a CreateStack, UpdateStack, ValidateTemplate request with an Amazon S3 template URL.
460,800 bytes
To use a larger template body, separate your template into multiple templates by using, for example, nested stacks.


Template description
Maximum size of a template description.
1,024 bytes
