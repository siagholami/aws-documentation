Properties
AgentVersion 
The default AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent version. You have the following options:
  INHERIT - Use the stack's default agent version setting.
  version_number - Use the specified agent version. This value overrides the stack's default setting. To update the agent version, edit the instance configuration and specify a new version. AWS OpsWorks Stacks then automatically installs that version on the instance.
The default setting is INHERIT. To specify an agent version, you must use the complete version number, not the abbreviated number shown on the console. For a list of available agent version numbers, call DescribeAgentVersions. AgentVersion cannot be set to Chef 12.2.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
AmiId 
A custom AMI ID to be used to create the instance. The AMI should be based on one of the supported operating systems. For more information, see Using Custom AMIs.
If you specify a custom AMI, you must set Os to Custom.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Architecture 
The instance architecture. The default option is x86_64. Instance types do not necessarily support both architectures. For a list of the architectures that are supported by the different instance types, see Instance Families and Types.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: i386 | x86_64

AvailabilityZone 
The Availability Zone of the AWS OpsWorks instance, such as us-east-2a.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
BlockDeviceMappings 
An array of BlockDeviceMapping objects that specify the instance's block devices. For more information, see Block Device Mapping. Note that block device mappings are not supported for custom AMIs.

InstallUpdatesOnBoot 
Whether to install operating system and package updates when the instance boots. The default value is true. To control when updates are installed, set this value to false. You must then update your instances manually by using CreateDeployment to run the update_dependencies stack command or by manually running yum (Amazon Linux) or apt-get (Ubuntu) on the instances. 
We strongly recommend using the default value of true to ensure that your instances have the latest security updates.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
InstanceType 
The instance type, such as t2.micro. For a list of supported instance types, open the stack in the console, choose Instances, and choose  Instance. The Size list contains the currently supported types. For more information, see Instance Families and Types. The parameter values that you use to specify the various types are in the API Name column of the Available Instance Types table.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
LayerIds 
An array that contains the instance's layer IDs.
Required: Yes
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
Os 
The instance's operating system, which must be set to one of the following.
 A supported Linux operating system: An Amazon Linux version, such as Amazon Linux 2018.03, Amazon Linux 2017.09, Amazon Linux 2017.03, Amazon Linux 2016.09, Amazon Linux 2016.03, Amazon Linux 2015.09, or Amazon Linux 2015.03.

 A custom AMI: Custom.
For more information about the supported operating systems, see AWS OpsWorks Stacks Operating Systems.
The default option is the current Amazon Linux version. If you set this parameter to Custom, you must use the CreateInstance action's AmiId parameter to specify the custom AMI that you want to use. Block device mappings are not supported if the value is Custom. For more information about supported operating systems, see Operating SystemsFor more information about how to use custom AMIs with AWS OpsWorks Stacks, see Using Custom AMIs.

Tenancy 
The instance's tenancy option. The default option is no tenancy, or if the instance is running in a VPC, inherit tenancy settings from the VPC. The following are valid values for this parameter: dedicated, default, or host. Because there are costs associated with changes in tenancy options, we recommend that you research tenancy options before choosing them for your instances. For more information about dedicated hosts, see Dedicated Hosts Overview and Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts. For more information about dedicated instances, see Dedicated Instances and Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances.
Required: No
