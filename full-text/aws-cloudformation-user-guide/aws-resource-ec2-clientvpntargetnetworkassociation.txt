AWS::EC2::ClientVpnTargetNetworkAssociation
Specifies a target network to associate with a Client VPN endpoint. A target network is a subnet in a VPC. You can associate multiple subnets from the same VPC with a Client VPN endpoint. You can associate only one subnet in each Availability Zone. We recommend that you associate at least two subnets to provide Availability Zone redundancy.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON

  "Properties" : {
      "[ClientVpnEndpointId](#cfn-ec2-clientvpntargetnetworkassociation-clientvpnendpointid)" : String,
      "[SubnetId](#cfn-ec2-clientvpntargetnetworkassociation-subnetid)" : String
    }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::EC2::ClientVpnTargetNetworkAssociation
Properties: 
  [ClientVpnEndpointId](#cfn-ec2-clientvpntargetnetworkassociation-clientvpnendpointid): String
  [SubnetId](#cfn-ec2-clientvpntargetnetworkassociation-subnetid): String
Properties
ClientVpnEndpointId 
The ID of the Client VPN endpoint.

Examples
Associating a target subnet with a Client VPN endpoint
The following example associates a target network with a Client VPN endpoint.
YAML
myNetworkAssociation:
  Type: "AWS::EC2::ClientVpnTargetNetworkAssociation"
  Properties:
    ClientVpnEndpointId: 
      Ref: myClientVpnEndpoint
    SubnetId: 
      Ref: mySubnet
JSON
"myNetworkAssociation": {
    "Type": "AWS::EC2::ClientVpnTargetNetworkAssociation",
    "Properties": {
        "ClientVpnEndpointId": {
            "Ref": "myClientVpnEndpoint"
        },
        "SubnetId": {
            "Ref": "mySubnet"
        }
