CloudFormation resource provider schemas
In addition to the resource specification, CloudFormation makes available the resource provider schemas for the Amazon resources by region. Each resource provider schema is a JSON-formatted text file that defines the properties and attributes of a specific resource. 
For each region, CloudFormation offers a zip file containing the individual schema files for each resource available in that region. To download the resource provider schemas for a specific region, see the following table. You can also view a resource's provider schema using the CloudFormation registry.
Resource availability may vary by region. To check the availability of a resource in a given region, refer to the resource provider schemas for that region.
To learn more about resource provider schemas, including schema format and definitions, see Resource provider schema in the CloudFormation Command Line Interface User Guide.
