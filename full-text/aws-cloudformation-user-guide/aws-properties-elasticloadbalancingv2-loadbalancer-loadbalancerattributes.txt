The following attributes are supported by both Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers:
  access_logs.s3.enabled - Indicates whether access logs are enabled. The value is true or false. The default is false.
  access_logs.s3.bucket - The name of the S3 bucket for the access logs. This attribute is required if access logs are enabled. The bucket must exist in the same region as the load balancer and have a bucket policy that grants Elastic Load Balancing permissions to write to the bucket.

  routing.http.desync_mitigation_mode - Determines how the load balancer handles requests that might pose a security risk to your application. The possible values are monitor, defensive, and strictest. The default is defensive.
