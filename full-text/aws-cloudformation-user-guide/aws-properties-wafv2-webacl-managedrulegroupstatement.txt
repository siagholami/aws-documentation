AWS::WAFv2::WebACL ManagedRuleGroupStatement
Note
This is the latest version of AWS WAF, named AWS WAFV2, released in November, 2019. For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources from the prior release, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. 
A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a managed rule group. To use this, provide the vendor name and the name of the rule group in this statement. You can retrieve the required names by calling ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups.
You can't nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement, for example for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement. It can only be referenced as a top-level statement within a rule.
