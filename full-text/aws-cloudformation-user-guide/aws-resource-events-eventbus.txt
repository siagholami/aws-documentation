AWS::Events::EventBus
The AWS::Events::EventBus resource creates or updates a partner event bus or custom event bus. Partner event buses can receive events from applications and services created by AWS SaaS partners. You need to create a partner event bus for each partner event source that you want to receive events from. 
Custom event buses can receive events from your own custom applications.
To review the limit for how many rules each event bus may have, see Service Limits.
