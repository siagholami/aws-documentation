AWS::Pinpoint::SMSChannel
A channel is a type of platform that you can deliver messages to. To send an SMS text message, you send the message through the SMS channel. Before you can use Amazon Pinpoint to send text messages, you have to enable the SMS channel for an Amazon Pinpoint application.
The AWS::Pinpoint::SMSChannel resource defines the status, sender ID, and other settings of the SMS channel for an application.
