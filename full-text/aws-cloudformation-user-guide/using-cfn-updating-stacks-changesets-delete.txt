Deleting a change set
Deleting a change set removes it from the list of change sets for the stack. Deleting a change set prevents you or another user from accidentally executing a change set that shouldn't be applied. Unless you delete them, AWS CloudFormation retains all change sets until you update the stack.
To delete a change set (console)


In the AWS CloudFormation console, in Stacks, select the name of the stack that contains the change set that you want to delete.


In the navigation pane, choose Change Sets to view a list of the stack's change sets.


Select the name of the change set that you want delete.


On the change set's details page, choose Delete.



AWS CloudFormation immediately starts to delete the change set from the stack's list of change sets, and you're redirected to the Stacks page.
To delete a change set (AWS CLI)
 Run the aws cloudformation delete-change-set command, specifying the ID of the change set that you want to delete, as shown in the following example:
aws cloudformation delete-change-set --change-set-name arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:changeSet/SampleChangeSet/1a2345b6-0000-00a0-a123-00abc0abc000
