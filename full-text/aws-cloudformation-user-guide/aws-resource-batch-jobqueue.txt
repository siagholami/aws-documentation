AWS::Batch::JobQueue
The AWS::Batch::JobQueue resource specifies the parameters for an AWS Batch job queue definition. For more information, see Job Queues in the AWS Batch User Guide.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::Batch::JobQueue",
  "Properties" : {
      "[ComputeEnvironmentOrder](#cfn-batch-jobqueue-computeenvironmentorder)" : [ ComputeEnvironmentOrder, ... ],
      "[JobQueueName](#cfn-batch-jobqueue-jobqueuename)" : String,
      "[Priority](#cfn-batch-jobqueue-priority)" : Integer,
      "[State](#cfn-batch-jobqueue-state)" : String
    }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::Batch::JobQueue
Properties: 
  [ComputeEnvironmentOrder](#cfn-batch-jobqueue-computeenvironmentorder): 
    - ComputeEnvironmentOrder
  [JobQueueName](#cfn-batch-jobqueue-jobqueuename): String
  [Priority](#cfn-batch-jobqueue-priority): Integer
  [State](#cfn-batch-jobqueue-state): String
Properties
ComputeEnvironmentOrder 
The set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. The job scheduler uses this parameter to determine which compute environment should execute a given job. Compute environments must be in the VALID state before you can associate them with a job queue. You can associate up to three compute environments with a job queue.
Required: Yes
Type: List of ComputeEnvironmentOrder
Update requires: No interruption
JobQueueName 
The name of the job queue.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
Priority 
The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the priority parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order, for example, a job queue with a priority value of 10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of 1.
Required: Yes
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
State 
The state of the job queue. If the job queue state is ENABLED, it is able to accept jobs.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: DISABLED | ENABLED
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the job queue ARN, such as arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:111122223333:job-queue/HighPriority.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Examples
Job queue with two compute environments
The following example defines a job queue called HighPriority that has two compute environments mapped to it.

  "JobQueue": {
    "Type": "AWS::Batch::JobQueue",

    }
  }
