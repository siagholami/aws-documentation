AWS::CodeDeploy::Application
The AWS::CodeDeploy::Application resource creates an AWS CodeDeploy application. In CodeDeploy, an application is a name that functions as a container to ensure that the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment. You can use the AWS::CodeDeploy::DeploymentGroup resource to associate the application with a CodeDeploy deployment group. For more information, see CodeDeploy Deployments in the AWS CodeDeploy User Guide.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::CodeDeploy::Application",
  "Properties" : {
      "[ApplicationName](#cfn-codedeploy-application-applicationname)" : String,
      "[ComputePlatform](#cfn-codedeploy-application-computeplatform)" : String
    }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::CodeDeploy::Application
Properties: 
  [ApplicationName](#cfn-codedeploy-application-applicationname): String
  [ComputePlatform](#cfn-codedeploy-application-computeplatform): String
Properties
ApplicationName 
 A name for the application. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the application name. For more information, see Name Type. 
 Updates to ApplicationName are not supported. 
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 100
Update requires: Replacement
ComputePlatform 
The compute platform that CodeDeploy deploys the application to.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: ECS | Lambda | Server
Update requires: Replacement
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of an AWS::CodeDeploy::Application resource to the intrinsic Ref function, the function returns the application name, such as myapplication-a123d0d1.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Examples
Specify an application with a Lambda compute platform
The following example specifies a CodeDeploy application with a Lambda compute platform.
JSON
"CodeDeployApplication": {

  "Properties": {
    "ComputePlatform": "Lambda"
  }
}
YAML
CodeDeployApplication:
  Type: AWS::CodeDeploy::Application
  Properties:
    ComputePlatform: Lambda
Specify an application with a Server compute platform
The following example creates a CodeDeploy application with a Server compute platform.
JSON
"CodeDeployApplication": {
  "Type": "AWS::CodeDeploy::Application",
  "Properties": {
    "ComputePlatform": "Server"
  }
}
YAML
