AWS::Cognito::UserPool SmsConfiguration
The SMS configuration type that includes the settings the Cognito User Pool needs to call for the Amazon SNS service to send an SMS message from your AWS account. The Cognito User Pool makes the request to the Amazon SNS Service by using an AWS IAM role that you provide for your AWS account.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "[ExternalId](#cfn-cognito-userpool-smsconfiguration-externalid)" : String,
  "[SnsCallerArn](#cfn-cognito-userpool-smsconfiguration-snscallerarn)" : String
}
YAML
[ExternalId](#cfn-cognito-userpool-smsconfiguration-externalid): String
  [SnsCallerArn](#cfn-cognito-userpool-smsconfiguration-snscallerarn): String
Properties
ExternalId 
The external ID is a value. We recommend you use ExternalIdto add security to your IAM role, which is used to call Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for your user pool. If you provide an ExternalId, the Cognito User Pool uses it when attempting to assume your IAM role. You can also set your roles trust policy to require the ExternalID. If you use the Cognito Management Console to create a role for SMS MFA, Cognito creates a role with the required permissions and a trust policy that uses ExternalId.
