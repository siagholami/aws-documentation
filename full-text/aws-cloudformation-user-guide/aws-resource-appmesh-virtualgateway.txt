AWS::AppMesh::VirtualGateway
Creates a virtual gateway.
A virtual gateway allows resources outside your mesh to communicate to resources that are inside your mesh. The virtual gateway represents an Envoy proxy running in an Amazon ECS task, in a Kubernetes service, or on an Amazon EC2 instance. Unlike a virtual node, which represents an Envoy running with an application, a virtual gateway represents Envoy deployed by itself.
For more information about virtual gateways, see Virtual gateways.

Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the resource ARN. For example:
{ "Ref": "myVirtualGateway" } 
When you pass the logical ID of an AWS::AppMesh::VirtualGateway resource to the intrinsic Ref function, the function returns the gateway route ARN, such as arn:aws:appmesh:us-east-1:555555555555:virtualGateway/myVirtualGateway.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

Arn 
The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the virtual gateway.
MeshName 
The name of the service mesh that the virtual gateway resides in.
MeshOwner 
The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that shared the mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see Working with Shared Meshes.
ResourceOwner 
The AWS IAM account ID of the resource owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the mesh owner or of another account that the mesh is shared with. For more information about mesh sharing, see Working with Shared Meshes.
