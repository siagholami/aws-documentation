AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer
Specifies a Classic Load Balancer.
You can specify the AvailabilityZones or Subnets property, but not both.
If this resource has a public IP address and is also in a VPC that is defined in the same template, you must use the DependsOn attribute to declare a dependency on the VPC-gateway attachment.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

Properties
AccessLoggingPolicy 
Information about where and how access logs are stored for the load balancer.
Required: No
Type: AccessLoggingPolicy
Update requires: No interruption
AppCookieStickinessPolicy 
Information about a policy for application-controlled session stickiness.
Required: No
Type: List of AppCookieStickinessPolicy
Update requires: No interruption
AvailabilityZones 
The Availability Zones for the load balancer. For load balancers in a VPC, specify Subnets instead.
Update requires replacement if you did not previously specify an Availability Zone or if you are removing all Availability Zones. Otherwise, update requires no interruption.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: Some interruptions
ConnectionDrainingPolicy 
If enabled, the load balancer allows existing requests to complete before the load balancer shifts traffic away from a deregistered or unhealthy instance.
For more information, see Configure Connection Draining in the Classic Load Balancers Guide.
Required: No
Type: ConnectionDrainingPolicy
Update requires: No interruption
ConnectionSettings 
If enabled, the load balancer allows the connections to remain idle (no data is sent over the connection) for the specified duration.
By default, Elastic Load Balancing maintains a 60-second idle connection timeout for both front-end and back-end connections of your load balancer. For more information, see Configure Idle Connection Timeout in the Classic Load Balancers Guide.
Required: No
Type: ConnectionSettings
Update requires: No interruption
CrossZone 
If enabled, the load balancer routes the request traffic evenly across all instances regardless of the Availability Zones.
For more information, see Configure Cross-Zone Load Balancing in the Classic Load Balancers Guide.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
HealthCheck 
The health check settings to use when evaluating the health of your EC2 instances.
Update requires replacement if you did not previously specify health check settings or if you are removing the health check settings. Otherwise, update requires no interruption.
Required: No
Type: HealthCheck
Update requires: Some interruptions
Instances 
The IDs of the instances for the load balancer.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
LBCookieStickinessPolicy 
Information about a policy for duration-based session stickiness.
Required: No
Type: List of LBCookieStickinessPolicy
Update requires: No interruption
Listeners 
The listeners for the load balancer. You can specify at most one listener per port.
If you update the properties for a listener, AWS CloudFormation deletes the existing listener and creates a new one with the specified properties. While the new listener is being created, clients cannot connect to the load balancer.
Required: Yes
Type: List of Listeners
Update requires: No interruption
LoadBalancerName 
The name of the load balancer. This name must be unique within your set of load balancers for the region.
If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID for the load balancer. For more information, see Name Type. If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require replacement of this resource, but you can perform other updates. To replace the resource, specify a new name. 
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
Policies 
The policies defined for your Classic Load Balancer. Specify only back-end server policies.
Required: No
Type: List of Policies
Update requires: No interruption
Scheme 
The type of load balancer. Valid only for load balancers in a VPC.
If Scheme is internet-facing, the load balancer has a public DNS name that resolves to a public IP address.
If Scheme is internal, the load balancer has a public DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
SecurityGroups 
The security groups for the load balancer. Valid only for load balancers in a VPC.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
Subnets 
The IDs of the subnets for the load balancer. You can specify at most one subnet per Availability Zone.
Update requires replacement if you did not previously specify a subnet or if you are removing all subnets. Otherwise, update requires no interruption. To update to a different subnet in the current Availability Zone, you must first update to a subnet in a different Availability Zone, then update to the new subnet in the original Availability Zone.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: Some interruptions
Tags 
The tags associated with a load balancer.
Required: No
Type: List of Tag
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the name of the load balancer.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

CanonicalHostedZoneName 
The name of the Route 53 hosted zone that is associated with the load balancer. Internal-facing load balancers don't use this value, use DNSName instead.
CanonicalHostedZoneNameID 
The ID of the Route 53 hosted zone name that is associated with the load balancer.
DNSName 
The DNS name for the load balancer.
SourceSecurityGroup.GroupName 
The name of the security group that you can use as part of your inbound rules for your load balancer's back-end instances.
SourceSecurityGroup.OwnerAlias 
The owner of the source security group.
