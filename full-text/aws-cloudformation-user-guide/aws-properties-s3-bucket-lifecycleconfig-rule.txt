Properties
AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload 
Specifies a lifecycle rule that stops incomplete multipart uploads to an Amazon S3 bucket.
You must specify at least one of the following properties: AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload, ExpirationDate, ExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionTransition, NoncurrentVersionTransitions, Transition, or Transitions.
Required: Conditional
Type: AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload
Update requires: No interruption
ExpirationDate 
Indicates when objects are deleted from Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier. The date value must be in ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time.
You must specify at least one of the following properties: AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload, ExpirationDate, ExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionTransition, NoncurrentVersionTransitions, Transition, or Transitions.
Required: Conditional
Type: Timestamp
Update requires: No interruption
ExpirationInDays 
Indicates the number of days after creation when objects are deleted from Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time.
You must specify at least one of the following properties: AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload, ExpirationDate, ExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionTransition, NoncurrentVersionTransitions, Transition, or Transitions.
Required: Conditional
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
Id 
Unique identifier for the rule. The value can't be longer than 255 characters.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays 
For buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended), specifies the time, in days, between when a new version of the object is uploaded to the bucket and when old versions of the object expire. When object versions expire, Amazon S3 permanently deletes them. If you specify a transition and expiration time, the expiration time must be later than the transition time.
You must specify at least one of the following properties: AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload, ExpirationDate, ExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionTransition, NoncurrentVersionTransitions, Transition, or Transitions.
Required: Conditional
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
NoncurrentVersionTransition 
(Deprecated.) For buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended), specifies when non-current objects transition to a specified storage class. If you specify a transition and expiration time, the expiration time must be later than the transition time. If you specify this property, don't specify the NoncurrentVersionTransitions property.
You must specify at least one of the following properties: AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload, ExpirationDate, ExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionTransition, NoncurrentVersionTransitions, Transition, or Transitions.
Required: Conditional
Type: NoncurrentVersionTransition
Update requires: No interruption
NoncurrentVersionTransitions 
For buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended), one or more transition rules that specify when non-current objects transition to a specified storage class. If you specify a transition and expiration time, the expiration time must be later than the transition time. If you specify this property, don't specify the NoncurrentVersionTransition property.
You must specify at least one of the following properties: AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload, ExpirationDate, ExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionTransition, NoncurrentVersionTransitions, Transition, or Transitions.
Required: Conditional
Type: List of NoncurrentVersionTransition
Update requires: No interruption
Prefix 
Object key prefix that identifies one or more objects to which this rule applies.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Status 
If Enabled, the rule is currently being applied. If Disabled, the rule is not currently being applied.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Allowed values: Disabled | Enabled
Update requires: No interruption
TagFilters 
Tags to use to identify a subset of objects to which the lifecycle rule applies.
Required: No
Type: List of TagFilter
Update requires: No interruption
Transition 
(Deprecated.) Specifies when an object transitions to a specified storage class. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time. If you specify this property, don't specify the Transitions property.
You must specify at least one of the following properties: AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload, ExpirationDate, ExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionTransition, NoncurrentVersionTransitions, Transition, or Transitions.
Required: Conditional
Type: Transition
Update requires: No interruption
Transitions 
One or more transition rules that specify when an object transitions to a specified storage class. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time. If you specify this property, don't specify the Transition property.
You must specify at least one of the following properties: AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload, ExpirationDate, ExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays, NoncurrentVersionTransition, NoncurrentVersionTransitions, Transition, or Transitions.
Required: Conditional
Type: List of Transition
Update requires: No interruption
