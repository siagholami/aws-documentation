Are you a first-time AWS Health user?
If you are a first-time user of AWS Health, begin by reading the following sections:
 What is AWS Health?—This section describes the underlying data model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the service.
 Getting started with the AWS Personal Health Dashboard—The Personal Health Dashboard section describes using the Personal Health Dashboard to view events and affected entities and perform advanced filtering.
 Getting started with the AWS Health API—The AWS Health API section describes the operations that retrieve information about events and entities.
AWS Health provides a console, called the Personal Health Dashboard, to all customers. You do not need to write code or perform any actions to set up the dashboard. If you have a Business or Enterprise support plan, you can access the information presented on the dashboard programmatically. You can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or write code to make requests, by using either the REST API directly or the AWS SDKs.
For more information about using AWS Health with the AWS CLI, see the AWS CLI Reference for AWS Health. For instructions for installing the AWS CLI, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface.
