See the following information about how AWS Health works with traffic privacy.
You can enable AWS Health to work with AWS Organizations, so that you can view events from individual AWS accounts that are part of your organization. This feature provides you a centralized view for all AWS Health events, which includes operational issues, scheduled maintenance, and account notifications.
To do so, you must sign in with your organization's master account and enable this feature from the AWS Management Console or use the EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization API operation.
