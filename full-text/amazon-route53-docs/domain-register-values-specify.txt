Values that you specify when you register or transfer a domain
When you register a domain or transfer domain registration to Amazon Route 53, you specify the values that are described in this topic.
Note
If you're registering more than one domain, Route 53 uses the values that you specify for all of the domains that are in your shopping cart.
You can also change values for a domain that is currently registered with Route 53. Note the following:
 If you change contact information for the domain, we send an email notification to the registrant contact about the change. This email comes from route53-dev-admin@amazon.com. For most changes, the registrant contact is not required to respond.
 For changes to contact information that also constitute a change in ownership, we send the registrant contact an additional email. ICANN requires that the registrant contact confirm receiving the email. For more information, see First Name, Last Name and Organization later in this section.
For more information about changing settings for an existing domain, see Updating settings for a domain.

My Registrant, Administrative, and Technical contacts are all the same
Specifies whether you want to use the same contact information for the registrant of the domain, the administrative contact, and the technical contact. 
Contact Type
Category for this contact. Note the following:
 If you choose an option other than Person, you must enter an organization name.
 For some TLDs, the privacy protection available depends on the value that you choose for Contact Type. For the privacy protection settings for your TLD, see Domains that you can register with Amazon Route 53.
 For .es domains, the value of Contact Type must be Person for all three contacts.
First Name, Last Name
The first and last names of the contact.
For First Name and Last Name, we recommend that you specify the name on your official ID. For some changes to domain settings, you must provide proof of identity, and the name on your ID must match the name of the registrant contact for the domain.
If you're transferring a domain to Route 53 and the following are true, then you're changing the owner of the domain:
 The contact type is Person.
 You're changing the First Name and/or Last Name fields for the registrant contact from the current settings. 
In that case, ICANN requires that we email the registrant contact to get approval. The email comes from one of the following email addresses:    

[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
To determine who the registrar is for your TLD, see Domains that you can register with Amazon Route 53.
The registrant contact must follow the instructions in the email to confirm that the email was received, or we must suspend the domain as required by ICANN. When a domain is suspended, it's not accessible on the internet. 
If you change the email address of the registrant contact, this email is sent to the former email address and the new email address for the registrant contact.
Some TLD registrars charge a fee for changing the domain owner. When you change one of these values, the Route 53 console displays a message that tells you whether there is a fee.
Organization
The organization that is associated with the contact, if any. For the registrant and administrative contacts, this is typically the organization that is registering the domain. For the technical contact, this might be the organization that manages the domain.
When the contact type is any value except Person and you change the Organization field for the registrant contact, you change the owner of the domain. ICANN requires that we email the registrant contact to get approval. The email comes from one of the following email addresses:    

[See the AWS documentation website for more details]

If you change the email address for the registrant contact, we send a notification email to the former email address and the new email address. This email comes from route53-dev-admin@amazon.com. 
Phone
The phone number for the contact:
 If you're entering a phone number for locations in the United States or Canada, enter 1 in the first field and the 10-digit area code and phone number in the second field.

 .se
 .sg
 .co.uk, .me.uk, and .org.uk
In addition, many TLDs require a VAT identification number.
For information about valid values, see ExtraParam in the Amazon Route 53 API Reference.
Privacy Protection
Whether you want to conceal your contact information from WHOIS queries. If you select Hide contact information, WHOIS ("who is") queries will return contact information for the registrar or the value "Protected by policy."
You must specify the same privacy setting for the administrative, registrant, and technical contacts.
If you select Don't hide contact information, you'll get more email spam at the email address that you specified.
Anyone can send a WHOIS query for a domain and get back all of the contact information for that domain. The WHOIS command is available in many operating systems, and it's also available as a web application on many websites. 
Although there are legitimate users for the contact information associated with your domain, the most common users are spammers, who target domain contacts with unwanted email and bogus offers. In general, we recommend that you choose Hide contact information for Privacy Protection.
To enable or disable privacy protection for some domains, you must open a support case and request privacy protection.
For more information about privacy protection, see the following topics:

 Domains that you can register with Amazon Route 53
Auto Renew (Only available when editing domain settings)
Whether you want Route 53 to automatically renew the domain before it expires. The registration fee is charged to your AWS account. For more information, see Renewing registration for a domain.
If you disable automatic renewal, registration for the domain will not be renewed when the expiration date passes, and you might lose control of the domain name. 
The period during which you can renew a domain name varies by top-level domain (TLD). For an overview about renewing domains, see Renewing registration for a domain. For information about extending domain registration for a specified number of years, see Extending the registration period for a domain.
