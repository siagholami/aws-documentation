Amazon Route 53 pricing and billing
As with other AWS products, there are no contracts or minimum commitments for using Amazon Route 53. You pay only for the hosted zones that you configure and the number of DNS queries that Route 53 answers. For more information, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing.
For information about billing for AWS services, including how to view your bill and manage your account and payments, see the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
