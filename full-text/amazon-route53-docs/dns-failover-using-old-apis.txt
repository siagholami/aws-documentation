Using health checks with Amazon Route 53 API versions earlier than 2012-12-12
Health checks are supported starting with the 2012-12-12 version of the Amazon Route 53 API. If a hosted zone contains records that health checks are configured for, we recommend that you use only the 2012-12-12 API or later. Note the following restrictions on using health checks with earlier API versions.
 The ChangeResourceRecordSets action cannot create or delete records that include the EvaluateTargetHealth, Failover, or HealthCheckId elements.
 The ListResourceRecordSets action can list records that include these elements, but the elements are not included in the output. Instead, the Value element of the response contains a message that says the record includes an unsupported attribute.
