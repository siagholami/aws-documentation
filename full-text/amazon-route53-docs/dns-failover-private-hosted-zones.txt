Configuring failover in a private hosted zone
If you're creating failover records in a private hosted zone, note the following:
 RouteÂ 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC.
 You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server.
 You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the data stream for the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the EC2 StatusCheckFailed metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the data stream for the alarm. For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the CloudWatch console, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
