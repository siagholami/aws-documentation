Using Service Quotas to view and manage quotas
You can use the Service Quotas service to view quotas and to request quota increases for many AWS services. For more information, see the Service Quotas User Guide. (You can currently use Service Quotas to view and manage only Route 53 and Route 53 Resolver quotas. Domain registration quotas aren't available.) 
Note
To view quotas and request higher quotas for Route 53, you must change the Region to US East (N. Virginia). To view quotas and request higher quotas for Resolver, change to the applicable Region.
Quotas on entities
Amazon Route 53 entities are subject to the following quotas.
For information on getting current quotas (formerly referred to as "limits"), see the following Route 53 actions:
 GetAccountLimit – Gets quotas on health checks, hosted zones, reusable delegation sets, traffic flow policies, and traffic flow policy records
 GetHostedZoneLimit – Gets quotas on records in a hosted zone and on Amazon VPCs that you can associate with a private hosted zone
 GetReusableDelegationSetLimit – Gets the quota on the number of hosted zones that you can associate with a reusable delegation set

Hosted zones
500 per AWS account Request a higher quota.


Hosted zones that can use the same reusable delegation set
100 Request a higher quota.


Amazon VPCs that you can associate with a private hosted zone
100 Request a higher quota.


Private hosted zones that you can associate a VPC with
No quota *


Authorizations that you can create so you can associate VPCs that were created by one account with a hosted zone that was created by another account
100



* You can associate a VPC with any or all of the private hosted zones that you control through your AWS accounts. For example, suppose you have three AWS accounts and all three have the default quota of 500 hosted zones. If you create 500 private hosted zones for all three accounts, you can associate a VPC with all 1,500 private hosted zones.
Quotas on records

Records
10,000 per hosted zone Request a higher quota. For a quota greater than 10,000 records in a hosted zone, an additional charge applies.

100 records that have the same name and type


Geoproximity records

* The number of DNS queries per second (QPS) varies by the type of query, the size of the response, and the protocol in use. This limit is on a per elastic network interface (ENI) basis. For example, with a limit of 10,000 QPS, 2 ENIs would allow 20,000 QPS. From there you can scale out by adding more ENIs.

Maximums on API requests
Amazon Route 53 API requests are subject to the following maximums.
Topics
 Number of elements and characters in ChangeResourceRecordSets requests
 Frequency of Amazon Route 53 API requests
 Frequency of Route 53 Resolver API requests
Number of elements and characters in ChangeResourceRecordSets requests
ResourceRecord elements
A request cannot contain more than 1,000 ResourceRecord elements. When the value of the Action element is UPSERT, each ResourceRecord element is counted twice.
Maximum number of characters
The sum of the number of characters (including spaces) in all Value elements in a request cannot exceed 32,000 characters. When the value of the Action element is UPSERT, each character in a Value element is counted twice.
Frequency of Amazon Route 53 API requests
All requests
Five requests per second per AWS account. If you submit more than five requests per second, Amazon Route 53 returns an HTTP 400 error (Bad request). The response header also includes a Code element with a value of Throttling and a Message element with a value of Rate exceeded.
If your application exceeds this limit, we recommend that you implement exponential backoff for retries. For more information, see Error Retries and Exponential Backoff in AWS in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
ChangeResourceRecordSets requests
If Route 53 can't process a request before the next request arrives, it will reject subsequent requests for the same hosted zone and return an HTTP 400 error (Bad request). The response header also includes a Code element with a value of PriorRequestNotComplete and a Message element with a value of The request was rejected because Route 53 was still processing a prior request.
CreateHealthCheck requests
You can submit a maximum of 1,000 CreateHealthCheck requests in a 24-hour period.
Frequency of Route 53 Resolver API requests
All requests
Five requests per second per AWS account per Region. If you submit more than five requests per second in a Region, Resolver returns an HTTP 400 error (Bad request). The response header also includes a Code element with a value of Throttling and a Message element with a value of Rate exceeded.
If your application exceeds this limit, we recommend that you implement exponential backoff for retries. For more information, see Error Retries and Exponential Backoff in AWS in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
