Routing traffic to Amazon WorkMail
If you're using Amazon WorkMail for your business email and you're using Amazon Route 53 as your DNS service, you can use Route 53 to route traffic to your Amazon WorkMail email domain. The name of your Route 53 hosted zone (such as example.com) must match the name of an Amazon WorkMail domain.
Note
You can route traffic to an Amazon WorkMail domain only for public hosted zones.
To route traffic to Amazon WorkMail, perform the following four procedures.
