Viewing the status of a domain registration
ICANN, the organization that maintains a central database of domain names, has developed a set of domain name status codes (also known as EPP status codes) that tell you the status of a variety of operations, for example, registering a domain name, transferring a domain name to another registrar, renewing the registration for a domain name, and so on. All registrars use this same set of status codes.
To view the status code for your domains, perform the following procedure. 
To view the status of a domain


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the RouteÂ 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/.


In the navigation pane, choose Registered Domains.


Choose the name of your domain.


For the current status of your domain, see the value of the Domain name status field. 


For a current list of domain name status codes and an explanation of what each code means, go to the ICANN website and search for epp status codes. (Search on the ICANN website; web searches sometimes return an old version of the document.)
