Enabling or disabling automatic renewal for a domain
When you want to change whether Amazon Route 53 automatically renews registration for a domain shortly before the expiration date, or you want to see the current setting for automatic renewal, perform the following procedure.
Note that you can't use AWS credits to pay the fee for renewing registration for a domain.
To enable or disable automatic renewal for a domain


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/.


In the navigation pane, choose Registered Domains.


Choose the name of the domain that you want to update.


Choose Enable (to turn on automatic renewal) or Disable (to turn off automatic renewal).


Choose Save.


If you encounter issues while enabling or disabling automatic renewal, you can contact AWS Support for free. For more information, see Contacting AWS Support about domain registration issues.
