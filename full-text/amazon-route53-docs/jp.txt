Domain locking to prevent unauthorized transfers
Not supported. We recommend that you prevent unauthorized transfers by restricting access to the RetrieveDomainAuthCode API action. (When you restrict access to this Route 53 API, you also restrict who can generate an authorization code using the Route 53 console, AWS SDKs, and other programmatic methods.) For more information, see Identity and access management in Amazon Route 53.
