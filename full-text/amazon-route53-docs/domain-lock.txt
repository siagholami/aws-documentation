Locking a domain to prevent unauthorized transfer to another registrar
The domain registries for all generic TLDs and many geographic TLDs let you lock a domain to prevent someone from transferring the domain to another registrar without your permission. To determine whether the registry for your domain lets you lock the domain, see Domains that you can register with Amazon Route 53. If locking is supported and you want to lock your domain, perform the following procedure. You can also use the procedure to disable the lock if you want to transfer a domain to another registrar.
