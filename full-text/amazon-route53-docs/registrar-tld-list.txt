Domains that you can register with Amazon Route 53
The following lists of generic and geographic top-level domains show the top-level domains (TLDs) that you can use to register domains with Amazon Route 53. We continue to add support for more TLDs, and we decide which TLDs to add based in part on customer feedback. To suggest a TLD that you'd like us to add, enter a comment on the Amazon Route 53 Domain Registration forum.

Internationalized domain names
Not all TLDs support internationalized domain names (IDNs), meaning domain names that include characters other than ASCII characters a-z, 0-9, and - (hyphen). The listing for each TLD indicates whether that TLD supports IDNs. For more information about internationalized domain names, see DNS domain name format.
Registering geographic domains with TLDs
The rules for registration of geographic TLDs vary by country. Some countries are unrestricted, meaning that anyone in the world can register, while others have certain restrictions, such as residency. The listing for each geographic TLD indicates any restrictions.
