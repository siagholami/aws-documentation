Guidelines for using the BatchImportFindings API
When using the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html API operation to send findings to AWS Security Hub, use the following guidelines.
 Send the largest batch that you can. Security Hub accepts up to 100 findings or 240 KB per batch, whichever comes first.
 The throttle rate limit is 10 TPS, with a burst of 30 TPS.
 You must implement a mechanism to retain the state of findings if throttling or network issues exist. You also need the finding state so that you can submit finding updates as a finding moves in and out of compliance.
 For information about the maximum lengths of strings and other limitations, see AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF) in the AWS Security Hub User Guide.
