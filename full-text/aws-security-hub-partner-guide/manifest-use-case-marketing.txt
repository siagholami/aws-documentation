Use case and marketing information
The following use cases can help you configure AWS Security Hub for different purposes.
Finding providers and consumers use case
Required for independent software vendors (ISV).
To describe your use case around your integration with AWS Security Hub, answer the following questions. If you do not plan to either send or receive findings, note that in this section and then complete the next section.
The following information must be reflected in your documentation.
 Will you send findings, receive findings, or both?
 If you plan to send findings, what types of findings will you send? Will you send all findings or a specific subset of findings?
 If you plan to receive findings, what will you do with those findings? What types of findings will you receive? For example, will you receive all findings, findings of a certain type, or only specific findings that a customer selects?
 Do you plan to update findings? If so, which fields will you update? Security Hub recommends that you update findings instead of always creating new ones. Updating existing findings helps decrease the finding noise for customers.
To update a finding, you send a finding with a finding ID that is assigned to a finding that you already sent.
To get early feedback on your use case and datasets, contact the APN Partner or Security Hub team.
Consulting Partner (CP) use case
Required if you are a Security Hub Consulting Partner.
Provide two customer use cases for your work with Security Hub. These can be private use cases. The Security Hub team does not advertise them anywhere. They should describe either or both of the following actions.
 How do you help customers bootstrap Security Hub? For example, have you helped customers use professional services, a Terraform module, or an AWS CloudFormation template?
 How do you help customers operationalize and extend Security Hub? For example, have you provided response or remediation templates, built custom integrations, or used business intelligence tools to set up an executive dashboard?

How many finding updates per month (average and maximum) do you expect to send to Security Hub across your customer base? Orders of magnitude estimates are acceptable. 
Latency
