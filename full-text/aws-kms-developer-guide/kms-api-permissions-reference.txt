AWS KMS API permissions: Actions and resources reference
The Actions and Resources Table is designed to help you define access control in key policies and IAM policies. The columns provide the following information:
 API operations and actions (permissions) lists each AWS KMS API operation and the corresponding action (permission) that allows the operation. You specify actions in a policy's Action element. 
 Policy type indicates whether the permission can be used in a key policy or IAM policy. When the type is key policy, you can specify the permission explicitly in the key policy. Or, if the key policy contains the policy statement that enables IAM policies, you can specify the permission in an IAM policy. When the type is IAM policy, you can specify the permission only in an IAM policy.
 Resources lists the AWS KMS resources to which the permissions apply. AWS KMS supports two resource types: a customer master key (CMK) and an alias. In a key policy, the value of the Resource element is always *, which indicates the CMK to which the key policy is attached. 
Use the following values to represent an AWS KMS resource in an IAM policy.
CMK
When the resource is a customer master key (CMK), use its key ARN. For help, see Finding the key ID and ARN.
arn:AWS_partition_name:kms:AWS_Region:AWS_account_ID:key/key_ID
For example:
arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
Alias
When the resource is an alias, use its alias ARN. To get the alias ARN, use the ListAliases operation.
arn:AWS_partition_name:kms:AWS_region:AWS_account_ID:alias/alias_name
For example:
arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias
* (asterisk)
When the permission doesn't apply to a particular resource (CMK or alias), use an asterisk (*).
In an IAM policy for an AWS KMS permission, an asterisk in the Resource element indicates all AWS KMS resources (CMKs and aliases). You can also use an asterisk in the Resource element when the AWS KMS permission doesn't apply to any particular CMKs or aliases. For example, when allowing or denying kms:CreateKey or kms:ListKeys permission, you can set the Resource element to * or to an account-specific variation, such as arn:AWS_partition_name:kms:AWS_region:AWS_account_ID:*.
 AWS KMS condition keys lists the AWS KMS condition keys that you can use to control access to the operation. You specify conditions in a policy's Condition element. For more information, see AWS KMS condition keys. This column also includes AWS global condition keys that are supported by AWS KMS, but not by all AWS services.
