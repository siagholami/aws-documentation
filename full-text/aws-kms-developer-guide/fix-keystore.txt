How to fix unavailable CMKs
The key state of customer master keys (CMKs) in a custom key store is typically Enabled. Like all CMKs, the key state changes when you disable the CMKs in a custom key store or schedule them for deletion. However, unlike other CMKs, the CMKs in a custom key store can also have a key state of Unavailable. 
A key state of Unavailable indicates that the CMK is in a custom key store that was intentionally disconnected from its AWS CloudHSM cluster and attempts to reconnect it, if any, failed. While a CMK is unavailable, you can view and manage the CMK, but you cannot use it for cryptographic operations.
To find the key state of a CMK, on the Customer managed keys page, view the Status field of the CMK. Or, use the DescribeKey operation and view the KeyState element in the response. For details, see Viewing keys.
The CMKs in a disconnected custom key store will have a key state of Unavailable or PendingDeletion. CMKs that are scheduled for deletion from a custom key store have a Pending Deletion key state, even when the custom key store is disconnected from its AWS CloudHSM cluster. This allows you to cancel the scheduled key deletion without reconnecting the custom key store. 
To fix an unavailable CMK, reconnect the custom key store. After the custom key store is reconnected, the key state of the CMKs in the custom key store is automatically restored to its previous state, such as Enabled or Disabled. CMKs that are pending deletion remain in the PendingDeletion state. However, while the problem persists, enabling and disabling an unavailable CMK does not change its key state. The enable or disable action takes effect only when the key becomes available.
For help with failed connections, see How to fix a connection failure. 
How to fix a failing CMK
Problems with creating and using CMKs in custom key stores can be caused by a problem with your custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster, the CMK, or its key material. 
When a custom key store is disconnected from its AWS CloudHSM cluster, the key state of CMKs in the custom key store is Unavailable. All requests to create CMKs in a disconnected custom key store return a CustomKeyStoreInvalidStateException exception. All requests to encrypt, decrypt, re-encrypt, or generate data keys return a KMSInvalidStateException exception. To fix the problem, reconnect the custom key store.
However, your attempts to use a custom key store CMK for cryptographic operations might fail even when its key state is Enabled and the connection status of the custom key store is Connected. This might be caused by any of the following conditions.
 The key material for the CMK might have been deleted from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. To investigate, find the key handle of the key material for a CMK and, if necessary, try to recover the key material.
 All HSMs were deleted from the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store. To use a CMK in a custom key store in a cryptographic operation, its AWS CloudHSM cluster must contain at least one active HSM. To verify the number and state of HSMs in an AWS CloudHSM cluster, use the AWS CloudHSM console or the DescribeClusters operation. To add an HSM to the cluster, use the AWS CloudHSM console or the CreateHsm operation.
 The AWS CloudHSM cluster associated with the custom key store was deleted. To fix the problem, create a cluster from a backup that is related to the original cluster, such as a backup of the original cluster, or a backup that was used to create the original cluster. Then, edit the cluster ID in the custom key store settings. For instructions, see How to recover deleted key material for a CMK.
How to fix a connection failure
If you try to connect a custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, but the operation fails, the connection status of the custom key store changes to FAILED. To find the status of a custom key store, view the Status column of the custom key store in the AWS Management Console or the ConnectionState element the DescribeCustomKeyStores response. 
Alternatively, some connection attempts fail quickly due to easily detected cluster configuration errors. In this case, the Status or ConnectionState is still DISCONNECTED. These failures return an error message or exception that explains why the attempt failed. Review the exception description and cluster requirements, fix the problem, update the custom key store, if necessary, and try to connect again.
When the connection status is FAILED, run the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the ConnectionErrorCode element in the response.
Note
When the connection status of a custom key store is FAILED, you must disconnect the custom key store before attempting to reconnect it. You cannot connect a custom key store with a FAILED connection status.
 CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND indicates that AWS KMS cannot find an AWS CloudHSM cluster with the specified cluster ID. This might occur because the wrong cluster ID was provided to an API operation or the cluster was deleted and not replaced. To fix this error, verify the cluster ID, such as by using the AWS CloudHSM console or the DescribeClusters operation. If the cluster was deleted, create a cluster from a recent backup of the original. Then, disconnect the custom key store, edit the custom key store cluster ID setting, and reconnect the custom key store to the cluster.
 INSUFFICIENT_CLOUDHSM_HSMS indicates that the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster does not contain any HSMs. To connect, the cluster must have at least one HSM. To find the number of HSMs in the cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. To resolve this error, add at least one HSM to the cluster. If you add multiple HSMs, it's best to create them in different Availability Zones.
 INTERNAL_ERROR indicates that AWS KMS could not complete the request due to an internal error. Retry the request. For ConnectCustomKeyStore requests, disconnect the custom key store before trying to connect again.
 INVALID_CREDENTIALS indicates that AWS KMS cannot log into the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster because it doesn't have the correct kmsuser account password. For help with this error, see How to fix invalid kmsuser credentials.
 NETWORK_ERRORS usually indicates transient network issues. Disconnect the custom key store, wait a few minutes, and try to connect again.
 SUBNET_NOT_FOUND indicates that at least one subnet in the AWS CloudHSM cluster configuration was deleted. If AWS KMS cannot find all of the subnets in the cluster configuration, attempts to connect the custom key store to the AWS CloudHSM cluster fail. 
To fix this error, create a cluster from a recent backup of the same AWS CloudHSM cluster. (This process creates a new cluster configuration with a VPC and private subnets.) Verify that the new cluster meets the requirements for a custom key store, and note the new cluster ID. Then, to associate the new cluster with your custom key store, disconnect the custom key store, change the cluster ID of the custom key store to the ID of the new cluster, and try to connect again.
Tip
To avoid resetting the kmsuser password, use the most recent backup of the AWS CloudHSM cluster.
 USER_LOCKED_OUT indicates that the kmsuser crypto user (CU) account is locked out of the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster due to too many failed password attempts. For help with this error, see How to fix invalid kmsuser credentials.
To fix this error, disconnect the custom key store and use the changePswd command in cloudhsm_mgmt_util to change the kmsuser account password. Then, edit the kmsuser password setting for the custom key store, and try to connect again. For help, use the procedure described in the How to fix invalid kmsuser credentials topic.
 USER_LOGGED_IN indicates that the kmsuser CU account is logged into the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from rotating the kmsuser account password and logging into the cluster. To fix this error, log the kmsuser CU out of the cluster. If you changed the kmsuser password to log into the cluster, you must also and update the key store password value for the custom key store. For help, see How to log out and reconnect.
 USER_NOT_FOUND indicates that AWS KMS cannot find a kmsuser CU account in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. To fix this error, create a kmsuser CU account in the cluster, and then update the key store password value for the custom key store. For help, see How to fix invalid kmsuser credentials.
How to fix invalid kmsuser credentials
When you connect a custom key store, AWS KMS logs into the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster as the kmsuser crypto user (CU). It remains logged in until the custom key store is disconnected. The DescribeCustomKeyStores response shows a ConnectionState of FAILED and ConnectionErrorCode value of INVALID_CREDENTIALS, as shown in the following example.
If you disconnect the custom key store and change the kmsuser password, AWS KMS cannot log into the AWS CloudHSM cluster with the credentials of the kmsuser CU account. As a result, all attempts to connect the custom key store fail. The DescribeCustomKeyStores response shows a ConnectionState of FAILED and ConnectionErrorCode value of INVALID_CREDENTIALS, as shown in the following example.
$ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores --custom-key-store-name ExampleKeyStore
{
   "CustomKeyStores": [
      "CloudHsmClusterId": "cluster-1a23b4cdefg",
      "ConnectionErrorCode": "INVALID_CREDENTIALS"
      "CustomKeyStoreId": "cks-1234567890abcdef0",
      "CustomKeyStoreName": "ExampleKeyStore",
      "TrustAnchorCertificate": "<certificate string appears here>",
      "CreationDate": "1.499288695918E9",
      "ConnectionState": "FAILED"
   ],
}
Also, after five failed attempts to log into the cluster with an incorrect password, AWS CloudHSM locks the user account. To log into the cluster, you must change the account password. 
If AWS KMS gets a lockout response when it tries to log into the cluster as the kmsuser CU, the request to connect the custom key store fails. The DescribeCustomKeyStores response includes a ConnectionState of FAILED and ConnectionErrorCode value of USER_LOCKED_OUT, as shown in the following example.
$ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores --custom-key-store-name ExampleKeyStore
{
   "CustomKeyStores": [
      "CloudHsmClusterId": "cluster-1a23b4cdefg",
      "ConnectionErrorCode": "USER_LOCKED_OUT"
      "CustomKeyStoreId": "cks-1234567890abcdef0",
      "CustomKeyStoreName": "ExampleKeyStore",
      "TrustAnchorCertificate": "<certificate string appears here>",
      "CreationDate": "1.499288695918E9",
      "ConnectionState": "FAILED"
   ],
}
To repair any of these conditions, use the following procedure. 


Disconnect the custom key store. 


Run the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and view the value of the ConnectionErrorCode element in the response. 
    If the ConnectionErrorCode value is INVALID_CREDENTIALS, determine the current password for the kmsuser account. If necessary, use the changePswd command in cloudhsm_mgmt_util to set the password to a known value.
    If the ConnectionErrorCode value is USER_LOCKED_OUT, you must use the changePswd command in cloudhsm_mgmt_util to change the kmsuser password.


Edit the kmsuser password setting so it matches the current kmsuser password in the cluster. This action tells AWS KMS which password to use to log into the cluster. It does not change the kmsuser password in the cluster.


Connect the custom key store.


How to delete orphaned key material
After scheduling deletion of a CMK from a custom key store, you might need to manually delete the corresponding key material from the associated cluster. 
When you create a CMK in a custom key store, AWS KMS creates the CMK metadata in AWS KMS and generates the key material in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. When you schedule deletion of a CMK in a custom key store, after the waiting period, AWS KMS deletes the CMK metadata. Then AWS KMS makes a best effort to delete the corresponding key material from the cluster. AWS KMS does not attempt to delete key material from cluster backups.
If AWS KMS cannot delete the key material, such as when the custom key store is disconnected, AWS KMS writes an entry to your AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the CMK ID, the AWS CloudHSM cluster ID, and the key handle of the key material.
To delete the key material from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster, use a procedure like the following one. This example uses the AWS CLI and AWS CloudHSM command line tools, but you can use the AWS Management Console instead of the CLI.


Disconnect the custom key store, if it is not already disconnected, then log into the key_mgmt_util, as explained in How to disconnect and log in.


Use the deleteKey command in key_mgmt_util to delete the key from the HSMs in the cluster.


For example, this command deletes key 262162 from the HSMs in the cluster. The key handle is listed in the CloudTrail log entry.
```
   Command: deleteKey -k 262162
       Cfm3DeleteKey returned: 0x00 : HSM Return: SUCCESS

       Cluster Error Status
       Node id 0 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
       Node id 1 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
       Node id 2 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS

```

Log out of key_mgmt_util and reconnect the custom key store as described in How to log out and reconnect.

How to recover deleted key material for a CMK
If the key material for a customer master key is deleted, the CMK is unusable and all ciphertext that was encrypted under the CMK cannot be decrypted. This can happen if the key material for a CMK in a custom key store is deleted from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. However, it might be possible to recover the key material.
When you create a customer master key (CMK) in a custom key store, AWS KMS logs into the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster and creates the key material for the CMK. It also changes the password to a value that only it knows and remains logged in as long as the custom key store is connected. Because only the key owner, that is, the CU who created a key, can delete the key, it is unlikely that the key will be deleted from the HSMs accidentally. 
However, if the key material for a CMK is deleted from the HSMs in a cluster, the CMK key state eventually changes to UNAVAILABLE. If you attempt to use the CMK for a cryptographic operation, the operation fails with a KMSInvalidStateException exception. Most importantly, any data that was encrypted under the CMK cannot be decrypted.
Under certain circumstances, you can recover deleted key material by creating a cluster from a backup that contains the key material. This strategy works only when at least one backup was created while the key existed and before it was deleted. 
Use the following process to recover the key material.

Find a cluster backup that contains the key material. The backup must also contain all users and keys that you need to support the cluster and its encrypted data.

Use the DescribeBackups operation to list the backups for a cluster. Then use the backup timestamp to help you select a backup. To limit the output to the cluster that is associated with the custom key store, use the Filters parameter, as shown in the following example. 
$ aws cloudhsmv2 describe-backups --filters clusterIds=<cluster ID>
   {
       "Backups": [
           {
               "ClusterId": "cluster-1a23b4cdefg",
               "BackupId": "backup-9g87f6edcba",
               "CreateTimestamp": 1536667238.328,
               "BackupState": "READY"
           },
                ...
       ]
   }


Create a cluster from the selected backup. Verify that the backup contains the deleted key and other users and keys that the cluster requires. 


Disconnect the custom key store so you can edit its properties.


Edit the cluster ID of the custom key store. Enter the cluster ID of the cluster that you created from the backup. Because the cluster shares a backup history with the original cluster, the new cluster ID should be valid. 


Reconnect the custom key store.


How to log in as kmsuser
To create and manage the key material in the AWS CloudHSM cluster for your custom key store, AWS KMS uses the kmsuser crypto user (CU) account. You create the kmsuser CU account in your cluster and provide its password to AWS KMS when you create your custom key store.
In general, AWS KMS manages the kmsuser account. However, for some tasks, you need to disconnect the custom key store, log into the cluster as the kmsuser CU, and use the cloudhsm_mgmt_util and key_mgmt_util command line tools.
Note
While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create customer master keys (CMKs) in the custom key store or to use existing CMKs in cryptographic operations will fail. This action can prevent users from storing and accessing sensitive data.
This topic explains how to disconnect your custom key store and log in as kmsuser, run the AWS CloudHSM command line tool, and log out and reconnect your custom key store.

How to disconnect and log in
Use the following procedure each time to need to log into an associated cluster as the kmsuser CU.

Disconnect the custom key store, if it is not already disconnected. You can use the AWS Management Console or AWS KMS API. 

While your custom key is connected, AWS KMS is logged in as the kmsuser. This prevents you from logging in as kmsuser or changing the kmsuser password.
For example, this command uses DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect an example key store. Replace the example custom key store ID with a valid one.
$ aws kms disconnect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0


Start cloudhsm_mgmt_util. Use the procedure described in Prepare to run cloudhsm_mgmt_util section of the AWS CloudHSM User Guide.


Log into cloudhsm_mgmt_util on the AWS CloudHSM cluster as a crypto officer (CO). 


For example, this command logs in as a CO named admin. Replace the example CO user name and password with valid values.
aws-cloudhsm>loginHSM CO admin <password>
   loginHSM success on server 0(10.0.2.9)
   loginHSM success on server 1(10.0.3.11)
   loginHSM success on server 2(10.0.1.12)

Use the changePswd command to change the password of the kmsuser account to one that you know. (AWS KMS rotates the password when you connect your custom key store.) The password must consist of 7-32 alphanumeric characters. It is case-sensitive and cannot contain any special characters.

For example, this command changes the kmsuser password to tempPassword.
```
   aws-cloudhsm>changePswd CU kmsuser tempPassword
****CAUTION****
   This is a CRITICAL operation, should be done on all nodes in the
   cluster. Cav server does NOT synchronize these changes with the
   nodes on which this operation is not executed or failed, please
   ensure this operation is executed on all nodes in the cluster.
   *********

   ```

Log into key_mgmt_util or cloudhsm_mgmt_util as kmsuser using the password that you set. For detailed instructions, see Getting Started with cloudhsm_mgmt_util and Getting Started with key_mgmt_util. The tool that you use depends on your task.

For example, this command logs into key_mgmt_util.
```
   Command: loginHSM -u CU -s kmsuser -p tempPassword
   Cfm3LoginHSM returned: 0x00 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
Cluster Error Status
   Node id 0 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
   Node id 1 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
   Node id 2 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
   ```
How to log out and reconnect

Perform the task, then log out of the command line tool. If you do not log out, attempts to reconnect your custom key store will fail.

```
   Command:  logoutHSM
   Cfm3LogoutHSM returned: 0x00 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
Cluster Error Status
   Node id 0 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
   Node id 1 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
   ```

Edit the kmsuser password setting for the custom key store. 

This tells AWS KMS the current password for kmsuser in the cluster. If you omit this step, AWS KMS will not be able to log into the cluster as kmsuser, and all attempts to reconnect your custom key store will fail. You can use the AWS Management Console or the KeyStorePassword parameter of the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation.
For example, this command tells AWS KMS that the current password is tempPassword. Replace the example password with the actual one. 
$ aws kms update-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 --key-store-password tempPassword

Reconnect the custom key store to AWS KMS. Replace the example custom key store ID with a valid one. During the connection process, AWS KMS changes the kmsuser password to a value that only it knows.

The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation returns quickly, but the connection process can take an extended period of time. The initial response does not indicate the success of the connection process.
$ aws kms connect-custom-key-store --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0

Use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation to verify that the custom key store is connected. Replace the example custom key store ID with a valid one.

In this example, the connection state field shows that the custom key store is now connected.
$ aws kms describe-custom-key-stores --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0
   {
      "CustomKeyStores": [
         "CustomKeyStoreId": "cks-1234567890abcdef0",
         "CustomKeyStoreName": "ExampleKeyStore",
         "CloudHsmClusterId": "cluster-1a23b4cdefg",
         "TrustAnchorCertificate": "<certificate string appears here>",
         "CreationDate": "1.499288695918E9",
         "ConnectionState": "CONNECTED"
      ],
   }
