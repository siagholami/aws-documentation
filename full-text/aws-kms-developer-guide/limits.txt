Quotas
To make AWS KMS responsive and performant for all users, AWS KMS applies two types of quotas. Each quota is calculated independently for each Region of each AWS account.
Important
If you need to exceed a quota, you can request a quota increase in Service Quotas. Use the Service Quotas console or the RequestServiceQuotaIncrease operation. For details, see Requesting a quota increase in the Service Quotas User Guide. If Service Quotas for AWS KMS are not available in the AWS Region, please visit the AWS Support Center and create a case. 
For help requesting an increase in an AWS KMS quota, see Request an AWS KMS Quota Increase.
 Resource quotas: Limit the number of each type of AWS KMS resource. 
 Request quotas: Limit the number of requests for AWS KMS API operations in a specified interval.
