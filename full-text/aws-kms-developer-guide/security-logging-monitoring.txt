Logging and monitoring in AWS Key Management Service
Monitoring is an important part of understanding the availability, state, and usage of your customer master keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS. Monitoring helps maintain the security, reliability, availability, and performance of your AWS solutions. AWS provides several tools for monitoring your CMKs.
AWS CloudTrail Logs
Every call to a AWS KMS API operation is captured as an event in a AWS CloudTrail log. These logs record all API calls from the AWS KMS console, and calls made by AWS KMS and other AWS services. Cross-account API calls, such as a call to use a CMK in a different AWS account, are recorded in the CloudTrail logs of both accounts.
When troubleshooting or auditing, you can use the log to reconstruct the lifecycle of a CMK. You can also view its management and use of the CMK in cryptographic operations. For more information, see Logging AWS KMS API calls with AWS CloudTrail.
Amazon CloudWatch Logs
Monitor, store, and access your log files from AWS CloudTrail and other sources. For more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
For AWS KMS, CloudWatch stores the seconds until key material expires, which is used for imported key material. For more information, see Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch.
Amazon CloudWatch Events
AWS KMS generates CloudWatch events when your CMK is rotated or deleted or the imported key material in your CMK expires. Search for AWS KMS events (API operations) and route them to one or more target functions or streams to capture state information. For more information, see AWS KMS events and the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide.
Amazon CloudWatch Metrics
You can monitor your customer master keys (CMKs) using CloudWatch metrics, which collects and processes raw data from AWS KMS into performance metrics. The data are recorded in two-week intervals so you can view trends of current and historical information. This helps you to understand how your CMKs are used and how their use changes over time. For information about using CloudWatch metrics to monitor CMKs, see AWS KMS metrics and dimensions.
Amazon CloudWatch Alarms
Watch a single metric change over a time period that you specify. Then perform actions based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold over a number of time periods. For example, you can create a CloudWatch alarm that is triggered when someone tries to use a CMK that is scheduled to be deleted in a cryptographic operation. This indicates that the CMK is still being used and probably should not be deleted. For more information, see Creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to detect usage of a customer master key that is pending deletion.
