Identity and access management for AWS Key Management Service
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) helps an administrator securely control access to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to use AWS KMS resources. For more information, see Using IAM policies with AWS KMS.
Key policies are the primary mechanism for controlling access to customer master keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS. Every CMK must have a key policy. You can also use IAM policies and grants, along with key policies, to control access to your CMKs. For more information, see Authentication and access control for AWS KMS.
If you are using an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can create an interface VPC endpoint to AWS KMS powered by AWS PrivateLink. You can also use VPC endpoint policies to determine which principals can access your AWS KMS endpoint, which API calls they can make, and which CMKs they can access. For details, see Controlling access to a VPC endpoint.
