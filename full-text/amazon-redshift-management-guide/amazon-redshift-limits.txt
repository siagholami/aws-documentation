Amazon Redshift Spectrum quotas and limits
Amazon Redshift Spectrum has the following quotas and limits: 
 The maximum number of databases per AWS account when using an AWS Glue Data Catalog. For this value, see AWS Glue service quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. 
 The maximum number of tables per database when using an AWS Glue Data Catalog. For this value, see AWS Glue service quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. 
 The maximum number of partitions per table when using an AWS Glue Data Catalog. For this value, see AWS Glue service quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. 
 The maximum number of partitions per AWS account when using an AWS Glue Data Catalog. For this value, see AWS Glue service quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. 
 The maximum number of columns for external tables when using an AWS Glue Data Catalog, 1,598 when pseudocolumns are enabled, and 1,600 when pseudocolumns aren't enabled. 
 The maximum size of a string value in an ION or JSON file when using an AWS Glue Data Catalog is 16 KB. 
 You can add a maximum of 100 partitions using a single ALTER TABLE statement.
 All S3 data must be located in the same AWS Region as the Amazon Redshift cluster. 
 Timestamps in ION and JSON must use ISO8601 format. 
 External compression of ORC files is not supported. 
 Text, OpenCSV, and Regex SERDEs do not support octal delimiters larger than '\177'. 
 You must specify a predicate on the partition column to avoid reads from all partitions. 
For example, the following predicate filters on the column ship_dtm, but doesn't apply the filter to the partition column ship_yyyymm:
WHERE ship_dtm > '2018-04-01'.
To skip unneeded partitions you need to add a predicate WHERE ship_yymmm = '201804'. This predicate limits read operations to the partition \ship_yyyymm=201804\.
These limits don't apply to an Apache Hive metastore.
