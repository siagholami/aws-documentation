Amazon Redshift API permissions reference
When you set up Access control, you write permission policies that you can attach to an IAM identity (identity-based policies). For detailed reference information, see Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Redshift in the IAM User Guide. This reference contains information about which Amazon Redshift API operations can be used in an IAM policy. It also includes the AWS resource for which you can grant the permissions, and condition keys that you can include for fine-grained access control. For more information about conditions, see Using IAM policy conditions for fine-grained access control. 
You specify the actions in the policy's Action field, the resource value in the policy's Resource field, and conditions in the policy's Condition field. To specify an action, use the redshift: prefix followed by the API operation name (for example, redshift:CreateCluster).
