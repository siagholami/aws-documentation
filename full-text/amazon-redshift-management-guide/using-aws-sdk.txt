Using the Amazon Redshift management interfaces
Amazon Redshift supports several management interfaces that you can use to create, manage, and delete Amazon Redshift clusters: the AWS SDKs, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and the Amazon Redshift management API.
The Amazon Redshift API – You can call this Amazon Redshift management API by submitting a request. Requests are HTTP or HTTPS requests that use the HTTP verbs GET or POST with a parameter named Action. Calling the Amazon Redshift API is the most direct way to access the Amazon Redshift service. However, it requires that your application handle low-level details such as error handling and generating a hash to sign the request.
 For information about building and signing an Amazon Redshift API request, see Signing an HTTP request.
 For information about the Amazon Redshift API actions and data types for Amazon Redshift, see the Amazon Redshift API reference.
AWS SDKs – You can use the AWS SDKs to perform Amazon Redshift cluster-related operations. Several of the SDK libraries wrap the underlying Amazon Redshift API. They integrate the API functionality into the specific programming language and handle many of the low-level details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. Calling the wrapper functions in the SDK libraries can greatly simplify the process of writing an application to manage an Amazon Redshift cluster.
 Amazon Redshift is supported by the AWS SDKs for Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js. The wrapper functions for Amazon Redshift are documented in the reference manual for each SDK. For a list of the AWS SDKs and links to their documentation, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.
 This guide provides examples of working with Amazon Redshift using the Java SDK. For more general AWS SDK code examples, see Sample code & libraries.
AWS CLI – The CLI provides a set of command line tools that you can use to manage AWS services from Windows, Mac, and Linux computers. The AWS CLI includes commands based on the Amazon Redshift API actions.
