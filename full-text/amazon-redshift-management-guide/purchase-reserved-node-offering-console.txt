Purchasing a reserved node offering with the Amazon Redshift console
You use the Reserved Nodes page in the Amazon Redshift console to purchase reserved node offerings, and to view current and past reservations. 
After you purchase an offering, the Reserved Node list displays your reservations and the details of each one, such as the node type, number of nodes, and status of the reservation. For more information about the reservation details, see How reserved nodes work. 
Note
A new console is available for Amazon Redshift. Choose either the New console or the Original console instructions based on the console that you are using. The New console instructions are open by default.

Upgrade a reserved node from DC1 to DC2
You can upgrade your DC1 reserved nodes to DC2 nodes for the remainder of your current term at no cost. DC2 is designed for demanding data warehousing workloads that require low latency and high throughput. 
Prerequisites
Migrate the cluster that includes the node you plan to upgrade before upgrading the reserved nodes. To migrate your DC1 cluster to DC2, use the resize or restore operation. If your cluster is a DC1.large cluster, you can restore to a new DC2.large cluster using an existing snapshot. If your cluster is a DC1.8xlage cluster, you can resize it to be a DC2.8xlarge cluster. Make sure that the DC1 cluster is shut down before you upgrade the reserved nodes. The DC2 cluster accrues on-demand pricing until you upgrade the DC1 reserved nodes. 
For more information about restoring from a snapshot, see Amazon Redshift snapshots. For more information about resizing a cluster, see Resizing clusters in Amazon Redshift.

Upgrading reserved nodes with the AWS CLI
To upgrade a reserved node reservation with the AWS CLI

Obtain a list of ReservedNodeOfferingID's for offerings that meet your requirements for payment type, term, and charges. The following example illustrates this step. 

aws redshift get-reserved-node-exchange-offerings --reserved-node-id xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   {
       "ReservedNodeOfferings": [
           {
               "Duration": 31536000,
               "ReservedNodeOfferingId": "yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy",
               "UsagePrice": 0.0,
               "NodeType": "dc2.large",
               "RecurringCharges": [
                   {
                       "RecurringChargeFrequency": "Hourly",
                       "RecurringChargeAmount": 0.2
                   }
               ],
               "CurrencyCode": "USD",
               "OfferingType": "No Upfront",
               "ReservedNodeOfferingType": "Regular",
               "FixedPrice": 0.0
           }
       ]
   }

Call accept-reserved-node-exchange and provide the ID for the DC1 reserved node that you want to exchange along with the ReservedNodeOfferingID you obtained in the previous step.

The following example illustrates this step.
aws redshift accept-reserved-node-exchange --reserved-node-id xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx --target-reserved-node-offering-id yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyyy
   {
       "ExchangedReservedNode": {
           "UsagePrice": 0.0,
           "OfferingType": "No Upfront",
           "State": "exchanging",
           "FixedPrice": 0.0,
           "CurrencyCode": "USD",
           "ReservedNodeId": "zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz",
           "NodeType": "dc2.large",
           "NodeCount": 1,
           "RecurringCharges": [
               {
                   "RecurringChargeFrequency": "Hourly",
                   "RecurringChargeAmount": 0.2
               }
           ],
           "ReservedNodeOfferingType": "Regular",
           "StartTime": "2018-06-27T18:02:58Z",
           "ReservedNodeOfferingId": "yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyyy",
           "Duration": 31536000
       }
   }
You can confirm that the exchange is complete by calling describe-reserved-nodes and checking the value for Node type.
