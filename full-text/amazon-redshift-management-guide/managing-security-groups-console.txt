Managing cluster security groups using the console
You can create, modify, and delete cluster security groups by using the Amazon Redshift console. You can also manage the default cluster security group in the Amazon Redshift console. All of the tasks start from the cluster security group list. You must choose a cluster security group to manage it.
You can't delete the default cluster security group, but you can modify it by authorizing or revoking ingress access.

Associating a cluster security group with a cluster
If you are on the EC2-VPC platform, see Managing VPC security groups for a cluster for more information about associating VPC security groups with your cluster. We recommend that you launch your cluster in an EC2-VPC platform. However, you can restore an EC2-Classic snapshot to an EC2-VPC cluster using the Amazon Redshift console. For more information, see Restoring a cluster from a snapshot.
Each cluster you provision on the EC2-Classic platform has one or more cluster security groups associated with it. You can associate a cluster security group with a cluster when you create the cluster, or you can associate a cluster security group later by modifying the cluster. For more information, see Creating a cluster by using a launch cluster and To modify a cluster.
