Managing cluster subnet groups using the console
You can manage your cluster subnet groups using the Amazon Redshift console. You can create a cluster subnet group, manage an existing one, or delete one. All of these tasks start from the cluster subnet group list. You must select a cluster subnet group to manage it.
You can provision a cluster on one of the subnets that you provide the subnet group. A cluster subnet group enables you to specify a set of subnets in your virtual private cloud (VPC). 
Creating a cluster subnet group
You must have at least one cluster subnet group defined to provision a cluster in a VPC.
