Managing parameter groups using the console
You can view, create, modify, and delete parameter groups on the Amazon Redshift console. 
You can view any of your parameter groups to see a summary of the values for parameters and workload management (WLM) configuration. Group parameters appear on the Parameters tab, and Workload queues appear on the Workload Management tab. 
Creating a parameter group
If you want to set parameter values that are different from the default parameter group, you can create your own parameter group, 
Note
A new console is available for Amazon Redshift. Choose either the New console or the Original console instructions based on the console that you are using. The New console instructions are open by default.

New console
To modify a parameter group


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.


On the navigation menu, choose CONFIG, then choose Workload management to display the Workload management page. 


Choose the parameter group that you want to modify to display the details page, with tabs for Parameters and Workload management. 


Choose the Parameters tab to view the current parameter settings. 


Choose Edit parameters to enable changing settings for these parameters: 
    auto_analyze
    datestyle
    enable_user_activity_logging
    extra_float_digits
    max_concurrency_scaling_clusters
    max_cursor_result_set_size
    query_group
    require_ssl
    search_path
    statement_timeout
    use_fips_ssl


For more information about these parameters, see Amazon Redshift parameter groups. 

Enter your changes and then choose Save to update the parameter group. 

To modify the WLM configuration for a parameter group


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.


On the navigation menu, choose CONFIG, then choose Workload management to display the Workload management page. 


Choose the parameter group that you want to modify to display the details page with tabs for Parameters and Workload management. 


Choose the Workload management tab to view the current WLM configuration. 


Choose Edit workload queues to edit the WLM configuration, 


(Optional) Select Enable short query acceleration to enable short query acceleration (SQA).


When you enable SQA, Maximum run time for short queries (1 to 20 seconds) is set to Dynamic by default. To set the maximum runtime to a fixed value, choose a value of 1–20.


Do one or more of the following to modify the queue configuration: 
    Choose Switch WLM mode to choose between Automatic WLM and Manual WLM.
With Automatic WLM, the Memory and Concurrency on main values are set to auto.
    To create a queue, choose Edit workload queues, then choose Add Queue.
    To modify a queue, change property values in the table. Depending on the type of queue, properties can include the following:
  Queue name can be changed. 
  Memory (%)
  Concurrency on main cluster
  Concurrency scaling mode can be off or auto
  Timeout (ms)
  User groups
  Query groups
For more information about these properties, see Properties for the wlm_json_configuration parameter.
Important
If you change a queue name, the QueueName dimension value of WLM queue metrics (such as, WLMQueueLength, WLMQueueWaitTime, WLMQueriesCompletedPerSecond, WLMQueryDuration, WLMRunningQueries, and so on) also changes. So, if you change the name of a queue, you might need to change CloudWatch alarms you have set up. 
    To change the order of queues, choose the Up and Down arrow buttons. 
    To delete a queue, choose Delete in the queue's row in the table.


(Optional) Select Defer dynamic changes until reboot to have the changes applied to clusters after their next reboot.
Note
Some changes require a cluster reboot regardless of this setting. For more information, see WLM dynamic and static properties.


Choose Save.


Original console

Creating or modifying a query monitoring rule using the console
You can use the Amazon Redshift console to create and modify WLM query monitoring rules. Query monitoring rules are part of the WLM configuration parameter for a parameter group. For more information, see WLM query monitoring rules. 
When you create a rule, you define the rule name, one or more predicates, and an action. 
When you save WLM configuration that includes a rule, you can view the JSON code for the rule definition as part of the JSON for the WLM configuration parameter. 
Note
A new console is available for Amazon Redshift. Choose either the New console or the Original console instructions based on the console that you are using. The New console instructions are open by default.
New console
To create a query monitoring rule


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.


On the navigation menu, choose CONFIG, then choose Workload management to display the Workload management page. 


Choose the parameter group that you want to modify to display the details page with tabs for Parameters and Workload management. 


Choose the Workload management tab, and choose Edit workload queues to edit the WLM configuration,


Add a new rule either by using a predefined template or from scratch. 


To use a predefined template, do the following: 


Choose Add rule from template in the Query monitoring rules group. The list of rule templates is displayed. 


Choose one or more rule templates. When you choose Save, WLM creates one rule for each template that you choose. 


Enter or confirm values for the rule, including Rule names, Predicates and Actions. 


Choose Save. 


To add a new rule from scratch, do the following:


To add additional predicates, choose Add predicate. You can have up to three predicates for each rule. If all of the predicates are met, WLM triggers the associated action. 


Choose an Action. Each rule has one action.


Choose Save.


Amazon Redshift generates your WLM configuration parameter in JSON format and displays it in the JSON section. 
Original console
To create a query monitoring rule


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.


In the navigation pane, choose Workload management.


For Parameter groups, choose the parameter group that you want to modify.
Note
You can't modify the default parameter group.


To edit the WLM configuration (to add a rule), choose Edit. 


To create a new rule using a predefined template, in the Rules for Queue 1 group, choose Add Rule from Templates. The Rule Templates dialog box appears, as shown in the following screenshot. 



Choose one or more rule templates. WLM creates one rule for each template you choose. For this example, choose Long running query with high I/O skew and then choose Select.


A new rule appears with two predicates, as shown in the following screenshot. 



Enter a value for Rule name. The name can be up to 32 alphanumeric characters and must not contain spaces or quotation mark characters. For this example, enter HighIOskew.


(Optional) Modify the rule predicates.


Choose a value for Action. Each rule has one action. For this example, choose Hop. Hop terminates the query and WLM routes the query to the next matching queue, if one is available. 


Choose Save. 



To modify the rules for a queue, choose Edit.


To add a new rule from scratch, choose Add Custom Rule. You can have a maximum of five rules per queue, and a total of eight rules for all queues.


Enter a Rule name, for example NestedLoop. 


Define a Predicate value. Choose a predicate name, an operator, and a value. For this example, choose Nested loop join count (rows). Leave the operator at greater than ( > ), and for the value type 1000. The following screen shot shows the new rule with one predicate. 



To add additional predicates, choose the add icon to the right of the predicates. You can have up to three predicates per rule. If all of the predicates are met, WLM triggers the associated action. 


Choose an Action. Each rule has one action. For this example, accept the default action, Log. The Log action writes a record to the STL_WLM_RULE_ACTION system table and leaves the query running in the queue. 


Choose Done Editing. The queue details collapse.


Choose Save.


Amazon Redshift generates your WLM configuration parameter in JSON format and displays the JSON in a window at the bottom of the screen, as shown in the following screenshot.

Deleting a parameter group
You can delete a parameter group if you no longer need it and it is not associated with any clusters. You can only delete custom parameter groups.
