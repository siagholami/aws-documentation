Internetwork traffic privacy
To route traffic between Amazon Redshift and clients and applications on a corporate network:
 Set up a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and your corporate network. Set up either an IPsec VPN connection over the internet or a private physical connection using AWS Direct Connect connection. AWS Direct Connect enables you to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premises network directly to your Amazon VPC, providing you with a private, high-bandwidth network connection between your network and your VPC. With multiple virtual interfaces, you can even establish private connectivity to multiple VPCs while maintaining network isolation. For more information, see What is AWS Site-to-Site VPN? and What is AWS Direct Connect? 
To route traffic between an Amazon Redshift cluster in a VPC and Amazon S3 buckets in the same AWS Region:
 Set up an Amazon S3 private VPC endpoint to privately access Amazon S3 data from an ETL load or unload. For more information, see Endpoints for Amazon S3. 
 Enable “Enhanced VPC routing” for an Amazon Redshift cluster, specifying a target Amazon S3 VPC endpoint. Traffic generated by Amazon Redshift COPY, UNLOAD, or CREATE LIBRARY commands are then routed through the private endpoint. For more information, see Enabling enhanced VPC routing.
