Managing snapshots using the console
Amazon Redshift takes automatic, incremental snapshots of your data periodically and saves them to Amazon S3. Additionally, you can take manual snapshots of your data whenever you want. In this section, you can find how to manage your snapshots from the Amazon Redshift console. For more information about snapshots, see Amazon Redshift snapshots.
All snapshot tasks in the Amazon Redshift console start from the snapshot list. You can filter the list by using a time range, the snapshot type, and the cluster associated with the snapshot. In addition, you can sort the list by date, size, and snapshot type.  Depending on the snapshot type that you select, you might have different options available for working with the snapshot.

   Alphabetic characters must be lowercase.
   The first character must be a letter.
   They cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
   They must be unique for all clusters within an AWS account.


In the Port box, accept the port from the snapshot or change the value as appropriate.


Select Allow Version Upgrade as appropriate.


In Cluster Subnet Group, select the subnet group into which you want to restore the cluster. 
This option only appears if you restore the cluster into the EC2-VPC platform.


For Publicly Accessible, select Yes if you want the cluster to have a public IP address that can be accessed over a public connection to the Internet. Select No if you want the cluster to have a private IP address that can only be accessed from within the VPC. If your AWS account allows you to create EC2-Classic clusters, the default is No. Otherwise, the default is Yes. 
This option only appears if you restore the cluster into the EC2-VPC platform.


In Choose a Public IP Address, select Yes if you want to select an elastic IP (EIP) address that you already have configured. Otherwise, select No to have Amazon Redshift create an EIP for your instance. 
This option only appears if you restore the cluster into the EC2-VPC platform.


In Elastic IP, select an EIP to use to connect to the cluster from outside of the VPC. 
This option only appears if you restore the cluster into the EC2-VPC platform and you select Yes in Choose a Public IP Address.


In the Availability Zone box, accept the Availability Zone from the snapshot or change the value as appropriate.


In Cluster Parameter Group, select a parameter group to associate with the cluster.

Choose Save to save your changes, or Cancel to roll back the changes.


Configuring cross-Region snapshot copy for a nonencrypted cluster
You can configure Amazon Redshift to copy snapshots for a cluster to another AWS Region. To configure cross-Region snapshot copy, you need to enable this copy feature for each cluster and configure where to copy snapshots and how long to keep copied automated snapshots in the destination AWS Region. When cross-Region copy is enabled for a cluster, all new manual and automated snapshots are copied to the specified AWS Region. Copied snapshot names are prefixed with copy:.
Note
A new console is available for Amazon Redshift. Choose either the New console or the Original console instructions based on the console that you are using. The New console instructions are open by default.

Configure cross-Region snapshot copy for an AWS KMSâ€“encrypted cluster
When you launch an Amazon Redshift cluster, you can choose to encrypt it with a master key from the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). AWS KMS keys are specific to an AWS Region. If you want to enable cross-Region snapshot copy for an AWS KMSâ€“encrypted cluster, you must configure a snapshot copy grant for a master key in the destination AWS Region. By doing this, you enable Amazon Redshift to perform encryption operations in the destination AWS Region.
The following procedure describes the process of enabling cross-Region snapshot copy for an AWS KMS-encrypted cluster. For more information about encryption in Amazon Redshift and snapshot copy grants, see Copying AWS KMSâ€“encrypted snapshots to another AWS Region. 
Note
A new console is available for Amazon Redshift. Choose either the New console or the Original console instructions based on the console that you are using. The New console instructions are open by default.

Choose Yes to choose an existing snapshot copy grant from the destination AWS Region. Then choose a grant from Snapshot Copy Grant.


Choose Save.


Modifying the retention period for cross-Region snapshot copy
After you configure cross-Region snapshot copy, you might want to change the settings. You can easily change the retention period by selecting a new number of days and saving the changes. 
Warning
You can't modify the destination AWS Region after cross-Region snapshot copy is configured. 
If you want to copy snapshots to a different AWS Region, first disable cross-Region snapshot copy. Then re-enable it with a new destination AWS Region and retention period. Any copied automated snapshots are deleted after you disable cross-Region snapshot copy. Thus, you should determine if there are any that you want to keep and copy them to manual snapshots before disabling cross-Region snapshot copy.
