February 4, 2019


Deferred maintenance
If you need to reschedule your cluster's maintenance window, you have the option to defer maintenance by up to 14 days. If we need to update hardware or make other mandatory updates during your period of deferment, we notify you and make the required changes. Your cluster isn't available during these updates. For more information, see Deferring maintenance.
November 20, 2018


Advance notification
Amazon Redshift provides notification in advance for some events. These events have an event category of pending. For example, we send an advance notification if a hardware update is required for one of the nodes in your cluster. You can subscribe to pending events the same as other Amazon Redshift events. For more information, see Subscribing to Amazon Redshift event notifications.
November 20, 2018


Elastic resize
Elastic resize is the fastest method to resize a cluster. Elastic resize adds or removes nodes on an existing cluster, then automatically redistributes the data to the new nodes. Because it doesn't create a new cluster, the elastic resize operation completes quickly, usually in a few minutes. For more information, see Resizing clusters.
November 15, 2018


New ODBC drivers
Amazon Redshift ODBC drivers have been updated to version 1.4.3.1000. For more information, see Configure an ODBC connection.

November 2, 2018


Modify cluster to change encryption
You can modify an unencrypted cluster to use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption, using either an AWS-managed key or a customer-managed key (CMK). When you modify your cluster to enable KMS encryption, Amazon Redshift automatically migrates your data to a new encrypted cluster. You can also migrate an unencrypted cluster to an encrypted cluster by modifying the cluster.
October 16, 2018

IAM Role Chaining
If an IAM role attached to your cluster doesn't have access to the necessary resources, you can chain another role, possibly belonging to another account. Your cluster then temporarily assumes the chained role to access the data. You can also grant cross-account access by chaining roles. Each role in the chain assumes the next role in the chain, until the cluster assumes the role at the end of chain. You can chain a maximum of 10 roles. For more information, see Chaining IAM roles in Amazon Redshift.
February 23, 2018
