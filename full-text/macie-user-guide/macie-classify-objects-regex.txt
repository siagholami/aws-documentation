Regex
Once Macie begins monitoring your data, it uses several automatic content classification methods to identify and prioritize your sensitive and critical data and to accurately assign business value to your data. One of these methods is classifying by regex.
Object classification by regex is based on specific data or data patterns that Macie searches for as it examines the contents of data objects. Macie offers a set of managed regexes, each with a designated risk level between 1 and 10, with 10 being the highest risk and 1 being the lowest.
Macie can assign one or more regexes to an object.
You can't modify existing or add new regexes. You can enable or disable any existing regexes, thus enabling or disabling Macie to assign them to your objects during the classification process.
To view, enable, or disable regexes


In the Macie console, navigate to the Settings page.


In the Classify data section, choose Regex.


Choose any of the listed managed regexes to view its details.


To enable or disable a regex, on its details page, use the Enabled/Disabled dropdown and choose Save.
The following is the complete list of regexes that Macie can assign to your objects during classification.
