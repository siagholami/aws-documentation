Service-Linked Roles for Amazon Macie
Amazon Macie uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)  service-linked roles to call other AWS services on your behalf. Service-linked roles provide a secure way to delegate permissions to Macie because only Macie can assume the service-linked role.
Permissions Granted by the Service-Linked Role
Macie uses the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie. It allows Amazon Macie to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS on your behalf.
The role trusts the macie.amazonaws.com service to assume it.
The role is configured with the following AWS managed policy.

Creating a Service-Linked Role for Macie
You don't need to manually create the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie role. Macie creates this role on your behalf as follows:
 Master account — The AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie role is created for you when you enable Macie for the first time.
 Member accounts — The AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie role is created for you when the master account associates the member account with Macie. The service-linked role that is created for the master Macie account doesn't apply to the member Macie accounts.
For Macie to create the service-linked role on your behalf, you must have the required permissions. To grant the required permissions to an IAM entity, such as a user, group, or role, attach the AmazonMacieFullAccess policy. For more information, see Predefined AWS Managed Policies for Macie and Service-Linked Role Permissions in the IAM User Guide.
You can also create the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie role manually. For more information, see Creating a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
Legacy Roles for Macie
If you used Macie before June 21, 2018, when it began supporting service-linked roles, the IAM roles that grant Macie access to call other AWS services on your behalf already exist in your AWS account (Macie master or member). These roles are AmazonMacieServiceRole and AmazonMacieSetupRole. They were created when you launched either the Macie AWS CloudFormation template for a master account or the Macie AWS CloudFormation template for a member account as part of setting up Macie.
The service-linked role replaces these previously created IAM roles (in master and member accounts). The previously created roles were not deleted, but they're no longer used to grant Macie permission to call other services on your behalf. You can use the IAM console to delete the previously created roles.
Editing a Service-Linked Role for Macie
After you create a service-linked role, you can't change the name of the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
Deleting a Service-Linked Role for Macie
If you no longer need to use Amazon Macie, we recommend that you delete the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie role.
For a master account, you can delete the Macie service-linked role only after disabling Macie. This ensures that you can't inadvertently remove permissions to access Macie resources. For member accounts, the master account must first disassociate them from Macie. For more information, see Disabling Amazon Macie and Deleting Collected Metadata.
When you disable Macie, the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie role is not deleted. If you enable Macie again, it uses the existing AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie role.
You can use the IAM console, the IAM CLI, or the IAM API to delete the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonMacie role. For more information, see Deleting a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
