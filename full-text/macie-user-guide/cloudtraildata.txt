Analyzing CloudTrail Search Results
The following section describes the elements of the search results that get displayed when you use the Research tab to investigate your Macie-monitored CloudTrail data.
Complete the following steps in the Research tab.


Select CloudTrail data in the first filter dropdown.


For this example, select Top 10 in the second filter dropdown.


For this example, select Past 90 days in the third filter dropdown.


Choose the button with the looking glass icon to start the search.


Your search produces the following elements:
 The total number of results that matched your CloudTrail data search for the selected time range.
 The graphical representation of CloudTrail data search results for the selected time range. 
Note
If your dataset is very large and you specify a very wide time range, your data might not render properly, and this graph might not appear as one of the resulting elements of your search.
Important
You can use the graph to further narrow your search and generate and run a query that produces a subset of the results generated by your original selections in the preceding steps. Double-click any of the graph's results and your selection is translated into a new query that automatically appears in the query parser, and the Research tab is refreshed with the results of this new query. 
 Search results summary â€“ A list of the most significant fields from your search. The first line includes the top (or bottom) three values for each field. The second line includes the top (or bottom) 10 values for each field. 
Important
You can use the fields in the search results summary to further narrow your search and generate and run a query that produces a subset of the results generated by your original selections in the preceding steps. Choose the first or the second line of results for any field, and in the expanded results breakdown, choose the looking glass icon next to any of the results. Your choices are then translated into a new query that automatically appears in the query parser, and the Research tab is refreshed with the results of this new query.
 A list of user sessions (5-minute aggregates of CloudTrail data) that match your search criteria. Choose any user session to expand it and view its details. 
CloudTrail Data Fields and Sample Queries
The following tables include the fields that can appear in the results of your CloudTrail data searches.
 The first table includes the fields that Macie extracts from CloudTrail. These fields also include Amazon S3 data events. For example, accountId in Macie corresponds to userIdentity.accountId in CloudTrail, and eventNameErrorCode.key in Macie corresponds to eventName in CloudTrail. 
 The second table includes the fields that Macie generates to provide further security intelligence and context based on the examined CloudTrail data. For example, isp.key describes the organization or the ISP that the API request against your AWS resources is coming from, and sourceIPAddress.ip_intel.type describes the IP address history: for example, whether it's a Tor exit node that is being used to initiate API requests against your AWS resources. 
CloudTrail Data Fields That Macie Extracts
Note
For this data repository (CloudTrail), your search always returns a list of user sessions: 5-minute aggregates of raw CloudTrail data. A user session is determined by the Macie unique ID: a format that is unique to Macie for specifying users. Macie unique ID is a combination of the IAM UserIdentity element and the recipientAccountId.
