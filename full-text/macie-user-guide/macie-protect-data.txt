Protecting Data with Amazon Macie
Macie can help you monitor how your sensitive and business-critical data stored in the cloud is being used. Macie applies artificial intelligence to understand historical data access patterns and automatically assesses activity of users, applications, and service accounts. This can help you detect unauthorized access and avoid data leaks.
After you enable Macie, it uses the following automated methods to protect your data.

AWS CloudTrail Events
Macie analyzes and processes a subset of data that CloudTrail logs and management events (API calls) that can occur in your infrastructure. Macie designates a risk level between 1 and 10 for each of the supported CloudTrail events.
