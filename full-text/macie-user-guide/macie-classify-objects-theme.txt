Theme
Once Macie begins monitoring your data, it uses several automatic content classification methods to identify and prioritize your sensitive and critical data and to accurately assign business value to your data. One of these methods is classifying by theme.
Object classification by theme is based on keywords that Macie searches for as it examines the contents of data objects. Macie offers a set of managed themes, each with a designated risk level between 1 and 10, with 10 being the highest risk and 1 being the lowest.
Macie can assign one or more themes to an object.
You can't modify existing or add new themes. You can enable or disable any existing themes, thus enabling or disabling Macie to assign them to your objects during the classification process.
To view, enable, or disable themes


In the Macie console, navigate to the Settings page.


In the Classify data section, choose Themes.


Choose any of the listed managed themes to view its details.


To enable or disable a theme, on its details page, use the Enabled/Disabled dropdown and then choose Save.
The following is the complete list of themes that Macie can assign to your objects during classification.
