Task List: Serving Private Content
To configure CloudFront to serve private content, do the following tasks:

(Optional but recommended) Require your users to access your content only through CloudFront. The method that you use depends on whether you're using Amazon S3 or custom origins:
    Amazon S3 – See Restricting Access to Amazon S3 Content by Using an Origin Access Identity.
    Custom origin – See  Restricting Access to Files on Custom Origins.

Custom origins include Amazon EC2, Amazon S3 buckets configured as website endpoints, Elastic Load Balancing, and your own HTTP web servers.
