Setting IAM Permissions and Roles for Lambda@Edge
To configure Lambda@Edge, you must set up specific IAM permissions and an IAM execution role. Lambda@Edge also creates service-linked roles to replicate Lambda functions to CloudFront Regions and to enable CloudWatch to use CloudFront log files.

IAM Permissions Required to Associate Lambda Functions with CloudFront Distributions
In addition to the IAM permissions that you need to use AWS Lambda, the IAM user needs the following IAM permissions to associate Lambda functions with CloudFront distributions:
 lambda:GetFunction
Allows the user to get configuration information for the Lambda function and a presigned URL to download a .zip file that contains the function.
For the resource, specify the ARN of the function version that you want to execute when a CloudFront event occurs, as shown in the following example:
arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:TestFunction:2
 lambda:EnableReplication*
Adds a permission to the resource policy that gives the Lambda replication service permission to get function code and configuration.
Important
The asterisk (*) at the end of the permission is required: lambda:EnableReplication*
For the resource, specify the ARN of the function (without the version number) that you want to execute when a CloudFront event occurs, as shown in the following example:
arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:TestFunction
 iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole
Allows the user to create a service linked role that is used by Lambda@Edge to replicate Lambda functions in CloudFront. After this role has been created by the first distribution you use with Lambda@Edge, you don’t need to add permission to other distributions that you use with Lambda@Edge.
 cloudfront:UpdateDistribution or cloudfront:CreateDistribution
Use cloudfront:UpdateDistribution to update a distribution or cloudfront:CreateDistribution to create a distribution.
For more information, see the following documentation:
 Identity and Access Management in CloudFront in this guide.
 Authentication and Access Control for AWS Lambda in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide
Function Execution Role for Service Principals
You must create an IAM role that can be assumed by the service principals lambda.amazonaws.com and edgelambda.amazonaws.com. This role is assumed by the service principals when they execute your function. For more information, see Creating the Roles and Attaching the Policies (Console) in the topic "AWS Managed Policies for Job Functions" in the IAM User Guide.
You add this role under the Trust Relationship tab in IAM (do not add it under the Permissions tab).
Here's an example role trust policy:
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
            "Service": [
               "lambda.amazonaws.com",
               "edgelambda.amazonaws.com"
            ]
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
   ]
}
For information about the permissions that you need to grant to the execution role, see Manage Permissions: Using an IAM Role (Execution Role) in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Note the following:
 By default, whenever a CloudFront event triggers a Lambda function, data is written to CloudWatch Logs. If you want to use these logs, the execution role needs permission to write data to CloudWatch Logs. You can use the predefined AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole to grant permission to the execution role.
For more information about CloudWatch Logs, see CloudWatch Metrics and CloudWatch Logs for Lambda Functions.
 If your Lambda function code accesses other AWS resources, such as reading an object from an S3 bucket, the execution role needs permission to perform that operation. 
Service-Linked Roles for Lambda@Edge
Lambda@Edge uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to a service. Service-linked roles are predefined by the service and include all of the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.
Lambda@Edge uses the following IAM service-linked role:
 AWSServiceRoleForLambdaReplicator–Lambda@Edge uses this role to allow Lambda@Edge to replicate functions to AWS Regions.
 AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger–CloudFront uses this role to push log files into your CloudWatch account, to help you to debug Lambda@Edge validation errors.
When you first add a Lambda@Edge trigger in CloudFront, a role named AWSServiceRoleForLambdaReplicator is automatically created to allow Lambda@Edge to replicate functions to AWS Regions. This role is required for using Lambda@Edge functions. The ARN for the AWSServiceRoleForLambdaReplicator role looks like this:
arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-service-role/replicator.lambda.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForLambdaReplicator
The second role, named AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger, is created automatically when you add Lambda@Edge function association to allow CloudFront to push Lambda@Edge error log files to CloudWatch. The ARN for the AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger role looks like this:
arn:aws:iam::account_number:role/aws-service-role/logger.cloudfront.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger
A service-linked role makes setting up and using Lambda@Edge easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions. Lambda@Edge defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and only Lambda@Edge can assume the roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy. The permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.
You must remove any associated CloudFront or Lambda@Edge resources before you can delete a service-linked role. This helps protect your Lambda@Edge resources by making sure that you don't remove a service-linked role that is still required to access active resources.
For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS Services That Work with IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column.
Service-Linked Role Permissions for Lambda@Edge
Lambda@Edge uses two service-linked roles, named AWSServiceRoleForLambdaReplicator and AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger. The following sections describe the permissions for each of these roles.
Service-Linked Role Permissions for Lambda Replicator
This service-linked role allows Lambda to replicate Lambda@Edge functions to AWS Regions.
The AWSServiceRoleForLambdaReplicator service-linked role trusts the following service to assume the role:
 replicator.lambda.amazonaws.com
The role permissions policy allows Lambda@Edge to complete the following actions on the specified resources:
 Action: lambda:CreateFunction on arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:*
 Action: lambda:DeleteFunction on arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:*
 Action: lambda:DisableReplication on arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:*
 Action: iam:PassRole on all AWS resources
 Action: cloudfront:ListDistributionsByLambdaFunction on all AWS resources
Service-Linked Role Permissions for CloudFront Logger
This service-linked role allows CloudFront to push log files into your CloudWatch account, to help you to debug Lambda@Edge validation errors.
The AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger service-linked role trusts the following service to assume the role:
 logger.cloudfront.amazonaws.com
The role permissions policy allows Lambda@Edge to complete the following actions on the specified resources:
 Action: logs:CreateLogGroup on arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/cloudfront/*
 Action: logs:CreateLogStream on arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/cloudfront/*
 Action: logs:PutLogEvents on arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/cloudfront/*
You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to delete the Lambda@Edge service-linked roles. For more information, see Service-Linked Role Permissions in the IAM User Guide.
Creating Service-Linked Roles for Lambda@Edge
You don’t typically manually create the service-linked roles for Lambda@Edge. The service creates the roles for you automatically in the following scenarios:
 When you first create a trigger, the service creates a role, AWSServiceRoleForLambdaReplicator, if the role doesn’t already exist, that allows Lambda to replicate Lambda@Edge functions to AWS Regions.
If you delete the service-linked role, the role will be created again when you add a new trigger for Lambda@Edge in a distribution.
 When you update or create a CloudFront distribution that has a Lambda@Edge association, the service creates a role, AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger, if the role doesn’t already exist, that allows CloudFront to push your log files to CloudWatch.
If you delete the service-linked role, the role will be created again when you update or create a CloudFront distribution that has a Lambda@Edge association.
If you must manually create these service-linked roles, run the following commands using the AWS CLI:
To create the AWSServiceRoleForLambdaReplicator role
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name replicator.lambda.amazonaws.com
To create the AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger role
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name logger.cloudfront.amazonaws.com
Editing Lambda@Edge Service-Linked Roles
Lambda@Edge does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForLambdaReplicator or AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger service-linked roles. After the service has created a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of a role by using IAM. For more information, see Editing a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
Deleting Lambda@Edge Service-Linked Roles
If you no longer need to use Lambda@Edge, we recommend that you delete the service-linked roles. That way you don’t have unused entities that are not actively monitored or maintained. However, you must clean up the Lambda@Edge resources in your account before you can manually delete the roles.
To remove all Lambda@Edge associations from your distributions, update your distributions to remove all Lambda@Edge function triggers, or remove the distributions that use Lambda@Edge functions. For more information, see Deleting Lambda@Edge Functions and Replicas.
After you have removed all Lambda@Edge function associations from your distributions and CloudFront has removed the function replicas from AWS locations, then you can delete the service-linked roles.
Note
If CloudFront hasn't finished updating, service-linked role deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes, and then try the deletion steps again.
You must follow separate procedures to manually delete each service-linked role: 
 You delete the AWSServiceRoleForLambdaReplicator role by using the CloudFront console.
 You delete the AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger role by using the IAM console.
To manually delete the AWSServiceRoleForLambdaReplicator service-linked role


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/.


On the CloudFront Distributions page, click the avatar in the upper right.



Choose Delete.



To manually delete the AWSServiceRoleForCloudFrontLogger service-linked roles


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Roles. Then select the check box next to the role name that you want to delete, not the name or row itself.


For Role actions at the top of the page, choose Delete role.


In the confirmation dialog box, review the service last accessed data, which shows when each of the selected roles last accessed an AWS service. This helps you to confirm whether the role is currently active. If you want to proceed, choose Yes, Delete to submit the service-linked role for deletion.


Watch the IAM console notifications to monitor the progress of the service-linked role deletion. Because the IAM service-linked role deletion is asynchronous, after you submit the role for deletion, the deletion task can succeed or fail. For more information, see Deleting a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
