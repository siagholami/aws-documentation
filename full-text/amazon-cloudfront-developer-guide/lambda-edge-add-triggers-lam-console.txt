Adding Triggers by Using the Lambda Console
To add triggers to a Lambda@Edge function (AWS Lambda console)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.


In the Region list at the top of the page, choose US East (N. Virginia).


On the Functions page, choose the name of the function that you want to add triggers for.


Choose Qualifiers, and then choose the Versions tab.


Choose the version that you want to add triggers to.
Important
You can't create triggers for the $LATEST version, you must create them for a numbered version.


After you choose a version, the name of the button changes to Version: $LATEST or Version: version number.


Choose the Triggers tab.


Choose Add triggers.


In the Add trigger dialog box, choose the dotted box, and then choose CloudFront.
Note
If you've already created one or more triggers, CloudFront is the default service.


Specify the following values to indicate when you want the Lambda function to execute.
Distribution ID
Choose the ID of the distribution that you want to add the trigger to.
Cache behavior
Choose the cache behavior that specifies the objects that you want to execute the function on.
If you specify * for the cache behavior, the Lambda function deploys to the default cache behavior.
CloudFront event
Choose the CloudFront event that causes the function to execute.
Include body
Select this check box if you want to access the request body in your function. 
Enable trigger and replicate
Select this check box so that AWS Lambda replicates the function to Regions globally.


Choose Submit.


The function starts to process requests for the specified CloudFront events when the updated CloudFront distribution is deployed. To determine whether a distribution is deployed, choose Distributions in the navigation pane. When a distribution is deployed, the value of the Status column for the distribution changes from In Progress to Deployed.
