You can access Amazon CloudFront in the following ways:
 AWS Management Console – The procedures throughout this guide explain how to use the AWS Management Console to perform tasks.
 AWS SDKs – If you're using a programming language that AWS provides an SDK for, you can use an SDK to access CloudFront. SDKs simplify authentication, integrate easily with your development environment, and provide access to CloudFront commands. For more information, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.
