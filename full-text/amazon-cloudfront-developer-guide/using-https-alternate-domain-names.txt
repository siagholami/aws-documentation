Using Alternate Domain Names and HTTPS
If you want to use your own domain name in the URLs for your files (for example, https://www.example.com/image.jpg) and you want your viewers to use HTTPS, you must complete the steps in this topic. (If you use the default CloudFront distribution domain name in your URLs, for example, https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/image.jpg, follow the guidance in the following topic instead:  Requiring HTTPS for Communication Between Viewers and CloudFront.)
Important
When you add a certificate to your distribution, CloudFront immediately propagates the certificate to all of its edge locations. As new edge locations become available, CloudFront propagates the certificate to those locations, too. You can't restrict the edge locations that CloudFront propagates the certificates to.
