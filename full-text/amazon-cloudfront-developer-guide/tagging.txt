Tagging Amazon CloudFront Distributions
Tags are words or phrases that you can use to identify and organize your AWS resources. You can add multiple tags to each resource, and each tag includes a key and a value that you define. For example, the key might be "domain" and the value might be "example.com". You can search and filter your resources based on the tags you add. 
The following are two examples of how it can be useful to work with tags in CloudFront: 
 Use tags to track billing information in different categories. When you apply tags to CloudFront distributions or other AWS resources (such as Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon S3 buckets) and activate the tags, AWS generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV file) with your usage and costs aggregated by your active tags. You can apply tags that represent business categories (such as cost centers, application names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services. For more information about using tags for cost allocation, see Use Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
 Use tags to enforce tag-based permissions on CloudFront distributions. For more information, see  Tag-Based Policies.
Note the following:
 You can tag web and RTMP distributions, but you can't tag origin access identities or invalidations.
 Tag Editor and Resource Groups are currently not supported for CloudFront. 
For the current maximum number of tags that you can add to a distribution, see Quotas. To request a higher quota (formerly known as limit), create a case with the AWS Support Center.
You can also apply tags to resources by using the CloudFront API, AWS CLI, SDKs, and AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell. For more information, see the following documentation:
 CloudFront API – See the following operations in the Amazon CloudFront API Reference:
   ListTagsForResource 
   TagResource 
   UntagResource 
 AWS CLI – See cloudfront in the AWS CLI Command Reference
 SDKs – See the applicable SDK documentation on the AWS Documentation page
 Tools for Windows PowerShell – See Amazon CloudFront in the AWS Tools for PowerShell Cmdlet Reference
