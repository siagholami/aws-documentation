Task List for Streaming Media Files Using RTMP
Note
Adobe designated Flash as end-of-life at the end of 2020. As a result, Amazon CloudFront will no longer support Adobe Flash Media Server and will be deprecating Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) distributions by December 31, 2020. For more information, read the full announcement on the Amazon CloudFront discussion forum.
The following task list summarizes the process for creating a distribution for video on demand (VOD) streaming using the Adobe RTMP protocol for any media player.
To Create an RTMP Distribution

Create an Amazon S3 bucket for your media files. If you are using a different Amazon S3 bucket for your media player, create an Amazon S3 bucket for the media player files, too.

The names of your buckets must be all lowercase and cannot contain spaces.


Choose and configure a media player to play your media files. For more information, refer to the documentation for the media player.


Upload the files for your media player to the origin from which you want CloudFront to get the files. If you are using an Amazon S3 bucket as the origin for the media player, make the files (not the bucket) publicly readable.


Create a web distribution for your media player. (You can also use an existing distribution.) For more information, see Steps for Creating a Distribution (Overview).


Upload your media files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you created for the media files, and make the content (not the bucket) publicly readable.
Important
Media files in a Flash Video container must include the .flv filename extension, or the media will not stream.


You can put media player files and media files in the same bucket.
