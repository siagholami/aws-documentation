CloudFront Returns an InvalidViewerCertificate Error When I Try to Add an Alternate Domain Name
If CloudFront returns an InvalidViewerCertificate error when you try to add an alternate domain name (CNAME) to your distribution, review the following information to help troubleshoot the problem. This error can indicate that one of the following issues must be resolved before you can successfully add the alternate domain name. 
The following errors are listed in the order in which CloudFront checks for authorization to add an alternate domain name. This can help you troubleshoot issues because based on the error that CloudFront returns, you can tell which verification checks have completed successfully.
There's no certificate attached to your distribution.
To add an alternate domain name (CNAME), you must attach a trusted, valid certificate to your distribution. Please review the requirements, obtain a valid certificate that meets them, attach it to your distribution, and then try again. For more information, see  Requirements for Using Alternate Domain Names.
There are too many certificates in the certificate chain for the certificate that you've attached.
You can only have up to five certificates in a certificate chain. Reduce the number of certificates in the chain, and then try again.
The certificate chain includes one or more certificates that aren't valid for the current date.
The certificate chain for a certificate that you have added has one or more certificates that aren't valid, either because a certificate isn't valid yet or a certificate has expired. Check the Not Valid Before and Not Valid After fields in the certificates in your certificate chain to make sure that all of the certificates are valid based on the dates that you’ve listed.
The certificate that you've attached isn't signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
The certificate that you attach to CloudFront to verify an alternate domain name cannot be a self-signed certificate. It must be signed by a trusted CA. For more information, see  Requirements for Using Alternate Domain Names.
The certificate that you've attached isn't formatted correctly
The domain name and IP address format that are included in the certificate, and the format of the certificate itself, must follow the standard for certificates.
There was a CloudFront internal error.
CloudFront was blocked by an internal issue and couldn't make validation checks for certificates. In this scenario, CloudFront returns an HTTP 500 status code and indicates that there is an internal CloudFront problem with attaching the certificate. Wait a few minutes, and then try again to add the alternate domain name with the certificate.
The certificate that you've attached doesn't cover the alternate domain name that you’re trying to add.
For each alternate domain name that you add, CloudFront requires that you attach a valid SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) that covers the domain name, to validate your authorization to use it. Please update your certificate to include a domain name that covers the CNAME that you’re trying to add. For more information and examples of using domain names with wildcards, see  Requirements for Using Alternate Domain Names.
I Can't View the Files in My Distribution
If you can't view the files in your CloudFront distribution, see the following topics for some common solutions.
Did You Sign Up for Both CloudFront and Amazon S3?
To use Amazon CloudFront with an Amazon S3 origin, you must sign up for both CloudFront and Amazon S3, separately. For more information about signing up for CloudFront and Amazon S3, see Setting up Amazon CloudFront.
Are Your Amazon S3 Bucket and Object Permissions Set Correctly?
If you are using CloudFront with an Amazon S3 origin, the original versions of your content are stored in an S3 bucket. The easiest way to use CloudFront with Amazon S3 is to make all of your objects publicly readable in Amazon S3. To do this, you must explicitly enable public read privileges for each object that you upload to Amazon S3.
If your content is not publicly readable, you must create a CloudFront origin access identity (OAI) so that CloudFront can access it. For more information about CloudFront origin access identities, see Restricting Access to Amazon S3 Content by Using an Origin Access Identity.
Object properties and bucket properties are independent. You must explicitly grant privileges to each object in Amazon S3. Objects do not inherit properties from buckets, and object properties must be set independently of the bucket.
Is Your Alternate Domain Name (CNAME) Correctly Configured?
If you already have an existing CNAME record for your domain name, update that record or replace it with a new one that points to your distribution's domain name.
Also, make sure that your CNAME record points to your distribution's domain name, not your Amazon S3 bucket. You can confirm that the CNAME record in your DNS system points to your distribution's domain name. To do so, use a DNS tool like dig. For information about dig, see http://www.kloth.net/services/dig.php.
The following example shows a dig request for a domain name called images.example.com and the relevant part of the response. Under ANSWER SECTION, see the line that contains CNAME. The CNAME record for your domain name is set up correctly if the value on the right side of CNAME is your CloudFront distribution's domain name. If it's your Amazon S3 origin server bucket or some other domain name, then the CNAME record is set up incorrectly.

For more information about CNAMEs, see Using Custom URLs for Files by Adding Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs).
Are You Referencing the Correct URL for Your CloudFront Distribution?
Make sure that the URL that you're referencing uses the domain name (or CNAME) of your CloudFront distribution, not your Amazon S3 bucket or custom origin. 
Do You Need Help Troubleshooting a Custom Origin?
If you need AWS to help you troubleshoot a custom origin, we probably will need to inspect the X-Amz-Cf-Id header entries from your requests. If you are not already logging these entries, you might want to consider it for the future. For more information, see Using Amazon EC2 or Other Custom Origins. For further help, see the AWS Support Center.
I Can't View the Files in My RTMP Distribution
If you can't view the files in your RTMP distribution, are your URL and your playback client correctly configured? RTMP distributions require you to use an RTMP protocol instead of HTTP, and you must make a few minor configuration changes to your playback client. For information about creating RTMP distributions, see Task List for Streaming Media Files Using RTMP. 
Error Message: Certificate:  Is Being Used by CloudFront
Problem: You're trying to delete an SSL/TLS certificate from the IAM certificate store, and you're getting the message "Certificate:  is being used by CloudFront."
Solution: Every CloudFront web distribution must be associated either with the default CloudFront certificate or with a custom SSL/TLS certificate. Before you can delete an SSL/TLS certificate, you must either rotate the certificate (replace the current custom SSL/TLS certificate with another custom SSL/TLS certificate) or revert from using a custom SSL/TLS certificate to using the default CloudFront certificate. To fix that, complete the steps in one of the following procedures:
 Rotating SSL/TLS Certificates
 Reverting from a Custom SSL/TLS Certificate to the Default CloudFront Certificate
