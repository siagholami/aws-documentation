CloudFront Usage Reports
The Amazon CloudFront console can display a graphical representation of your CloudFront usage that is based on a subset of the usage report data. You can display charts for a specified date range in the last 60 days, with data points every hour or every day. You can usually view data about requests that CloudFront received as recently as four hours ago, but data can occasionally be delayed by as much as 24 hours.
For more information, see How the Usage Charts Are Related to Data in the CloudFront Usage Report.
To display CloudFront usage charts


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/.


In navigation pane, click Usage Reports.


In the CloudFront Usage Reports pane, for Start Date and End Date, select the date range for which you want to display usage charts. Available ranges depend on the value that you select for Granularity:
    Daily — To display charts with one data point per day, select any date range in the previous 60 days. 
    Hourly — To display charts with one data point every hour, select any date range of up to 14 days within the previous 60 days. 


Dates and times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).


For Granularity, specify whether to display one data point per day or one data point per hour in the charts. If you specify a date range greater than 14 days, the option to specify one data point per hour is not available.


For Billing Region, choose the CloudFront billing region that has the data you want to view, or choose All Regions. Usage charts include data for requests that CloudFront processes in edge locations in the specified region. The region where CloudFront processes requests might or might not correspond with the location of your users. 


Select only regions that are included in the price class for your distribution; otherwise, the usage charts probably won't contain any data. For example, if you chose Price Class 200 for your distribution, the South America and Australia billing regions are not included, so CloudFront generally won't process your requests from those regions. For more information about price classes, see Choosing the price class for a CloudFront distribution.


In the Distribution list, select the distributions for which you want to display data in the usage charts: 
    An individual web distribution — The charts display data for the selected CloudFront distribution. The Distribution list displays the distribution ID and alternate domain names (CNAMEs) for the distribution, if any. If a distribution has no alternate domain names, the list includes origin domain names for the distribution.
    All Web Distributions (excludes deleted) — The charts display summed data for all web distributions that are associated with the current AWS account, excluding web distributions that you have deleted.
    All Deleted Distributions — The charts display summed data for all web distributions that are associated with the current AWS account and that were deleted in the last 60 days.


Click Update Graphs.


To view data for a daily or hourly data point within a chart, move your mouse pointer over the data point. 


For charts that show data transferred, note that you can change the vertical scale to gigabytes, megabytes, or kilobytes for each chart.
