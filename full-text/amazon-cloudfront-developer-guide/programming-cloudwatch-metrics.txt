Getting metrics using the CloudWatch API
You can use the Amazon CloudWatch API or CLI to get the CloudFront metrics in programs or applications that you build. You can use the raw data to build your own custom dashboards, your own alarming tools, and so on. To get the CloudFront metrics from the CloudWatch API, you must use the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1). You also need to know certain values and types for each metric.
Topics
 Values for all CloudFront metrics
 Values for individual CloudFront metrics
Values for all CloudFront metrics
The following values apply to all CloudFront metrics:
Namespace
The value for Namespace is always AWS/CloudFront.
Dimensions
Each CloudFront metric has the following two dimensions:  
DistributionId
The value for DistributionId is the ID of the CloudFront distribution for which you want to get metrics.
Region
The value for Region is always Global, because CloudFront is a global service.
Note
To get the CloudFront metrics from the CloudWatch API, you must use the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1).
Values for individual CloudFront metrics
Use information from the following list to get details about specific CloudFront metrics from the CloudWatch API. Some of these metrics are available only when you have enabled additional metrics for the distribution.
Note
Only one statistic, Average or Sum, is applicable for each metric. The following list specifies which statistic is applicable to that metric.
4xx error rate
The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response’s HTTP status code is 4xx.
 Metric name: 4xxErrorRate
 Valid statistic: Average
 Unit: Percent
401 error rate
The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response’s HTTP status code is 401. To get this metric, you must first enable additional metrics.
 Metric name: 401ErrorRate
 Valid statistic: Average
 Unit: Percent
403 error rate
The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response’s HTTP status code is 403. To get this metric, you must first enable additional metrics.
 Metric name: 403ErrorRate
 Valid statistic: Average
 Unit: Percent
404 error rate
The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response’s HTTP status code is 404. To get this metric, you must first enable additional metrics.
 Metric name: 404ErrorRate
 Valid statistic: Average
 Unit: Percent
5xx error rate
The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response’s HTTP status code is 5xx.
 Metric name: 5xxErrorRate
 Valid statistic: Average
 Unit: Percent
502 error rate
The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response’s HTTP status code is 502. To get this metric, you must first enable additional metrics.
 Metric name: 502ErrorRate
 Valid statistic: Average
 Unit: Percent
503 error rate
The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response’s HTTP status code is 503. To get this metric, you must first enable additional metrics.
 Metric name: 503ErrorRate
 Valid statistic: Average
 Unit: Percent
504 error rate
The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response’s HTTP status code is 504. To get this metric, you must first enable additional metrics.
 Metric name: 504ErrorRate
 Valid statistic: Average
 Unit: Percent
Bytes downloaded
The total number of bytes downloaded by viewers for GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests.
 Metric name: BytesDownloaded
 Valid statistic: Sum
 Unit: None
Bytes uploaded
The total number of bytes that viewers uploaded to your origin with CloudFront, using POST and PUT requests.
 Metric name: BytesUploaded
 Valid statistic: Sum
 Unit: None
Cache hit rate
The percentage of all cacheable requests for which CloudFront served the content from its cache. HTTP POST and PUT requests, and errors, are not considered cacheable requests. To get this metric, you must first enable additional metrics.
 Metric name: CacheHitRate
 Valid statistic: Average
 Unit: Percent
Origin latency
The total time spent, in milliseconds, from when CloudFront receives a request to when it starts providing a response to the network (not the viewer), for requests that are served from the origin, not the CloudFront cache. This is also known as first byte latency, or time-to-first-byte. To get this metric, you must first enable additional metrics.
 Metric name: OriginLatency
 Valid statistic: Percentile
 Unit: Milliseconds
To get a Percentile statistic from the CloudWatch API, use the ExtendedStatistics parameter, not Statistics. For more information, see GetMetricStatistics in the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference, or the reference documentation for the AWS SDKs.
Requests
The total number of viewer requests received by CloudFront, for all HTTP methods and for both HTTP and HTTPS requests.
 Metric name: Requests
 Valid statistic: Sum
 Unit: None
Total error rate
The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response’s HTTP status code is 4xx or 5xx.
 Metric name: TotalErrorRate
 Valid statistic: Average
 Unit: Percent
