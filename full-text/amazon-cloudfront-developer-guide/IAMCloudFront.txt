AWS Identity and Access Management
Amazon CloudFront integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), a service that lets your organization do the following:
 Create users and groups under your organization's AWS account
 Easily share your AWS account resources among the users in the account
 Assign unique security credentials to each user
 Granularly control user access to services and resources
For example, you can use IAM with CloudFront to control which users in your AWS account can create a new distribution or update cache behavior settings.
