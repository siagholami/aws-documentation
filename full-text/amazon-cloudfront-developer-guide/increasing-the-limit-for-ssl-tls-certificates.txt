Increasing the Quotas for SSL/TLS Certificates
There are quotas (formerly known as limits) on the number of SSL/TLS certificates that you can import into AWS Certificate Manager or upload to AWS Identity and Access Management. There also is a quota on the number of SSL/TLS certificates that you can use with an AWS account when you configure CloudFront to serve HTTPS requests by using dedicated IP addresses. However, you can request higher quotas.
