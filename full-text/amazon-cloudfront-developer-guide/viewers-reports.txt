CloudFront Viewers Reports
The CloudFront console can display four reports about the physical devices (desktop computers, mobile devices) and about the viewers (typically web browsers) that are accessing your content:
 Devices – The type of the devices that your users use most frequently to access your content, for example, Desktop or Mobile. 
 Browsers – The name (or the name and version) of the browsers that your users use most frequently to access your content, for example, Chrome or Firefox. The report lists the top 10 browsers.
 Operating Systems – The name (or the name and version) of the operating system that viewers run on most frequently when accessing your content, for example, Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows. The report lists the top 10 operating systems.
 Locations – The locations, by country or by U.S. state/territory, of the viewers that access your content most frequently. The report lists the top 50 countries or U.S. states/territories.
You can display all four Viewers reports for any date range in the previous 60 days. For the Locations report, you can also display the report with data points every hour for any date range of up to 14 days in the previous 60 days.

You don't need to enable access logging to view Viewers charts and reports.

Displaying Viewers Charts and Reports
To display CloudFront Viewers charts and reports, perform the following procedure.
To display CloudFront Viewers charts and reports


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/.


In the navigation pane, click Viewers.


In the CloudFront Viewers pane, for Start Date and End Date, select the date range for which you want to display viewer charts and reports. 


For the Locations chart, available ranges depend on the value that you select for Granularity:
    Daily – To display charts with one data point per day, select any date range in the previous 60 days.
    Hourly – To display charts with one data point every hour, select any date range of up to 14 days within the previous 60 days.
Dates and times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).


(Browsers and Operating Systems charts only) For Grouping, specify whether you want to group browsers and operating systems by name (Chrome, Firefox) or by name and version (Chrome 40.0, Firefox 35.0). 


(Locations chart only) For Granularity, specify whether to display one data point per day or one data point per hour in the charts. If you specify a date range greater than 14 days, the option to specify one data point per hour is not available.


(Locations chart only) For Details, specify whether to display the top locations by countries or by U.S. states.


In the Distribution list, select the distribution for which you want to display data in the usage charts:
    An individual web distribution – The charts display data for the selected CloudFront web distribution. The Distribution list displays the distribution ID and an alternate domain name (CNAME) for the distribution, if any. If a distribution has no alternate domain names, the list includes an origin domain name for the distribution.
    All Web Distributions (excludes deleted) – The charts display summed data for all web distributions that are associated with the current AWS account, excluding web distributions that you have deleted.


Click Update.


To view data for a daily or hourly data point within a chart, move your mouse pointer over the data point.

How Data in the Locations Report Is Related to Data in the CloudFront Access Logs
The following list shows how data in the Locations report in the CloudFront console corresponds with values in CloudFront access logs. For more information about CloudFront access logs, see Configuring and Using Standard Logs (Access Logs).
Location
The country or U.S. state that the viewer is in. In access logs, the c-ip column contains the IP address of the device that the viewer is running on. We use geolocation data to identify the geographic location of the device based on the IP address.
If you're displaying the Locations report by country, note that the country list is based on ISO 3166-2, Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions – Part 2: Country subdivision code. The country list includes the following additional values:
 Anonymous Proxy – The request originated from an anonymous proxy.
 Satellite Provider – The request originated from a satellite provider that provides internet service to multiple countries. Users might be in countries with a high risk of fraud.
 Europe (Unknown) – The request originated from an IP in a block that is used by multiple European countries. The country that the request originated from cannot be determined. CloudFront uses Europe (Unknown) as the default. 
 Asia/Pacific (Unknown) – The request originated from an IP in a block that is used by multiple countries in the Asia/Pacific region. The country that the request originated from cannot be determined. CloudFront uses Asia/Pacific (Unknown) as the default. 
If you display the Locations report by U.S. state, note that the report can include U.S. territories and U.S. Armed Forces regions.
If CloudFront can't determine a user's location, the location will appear as Unknown in viewer reports.
Request Count
The total number of requests from the country or U.S. state that the viewer is in, for the specified distribution and period. This value generally corresponds closely with the number of GET requests from IP addresses in that country or state in CloudFront access logs. 
Request %
One of the following, depending on the value that you selected for Details:
 Countries – The requests from this country as a percentage of the total number of requests. 
 U.S. States – The requests from this state as a percentage of the total number of requests from the United States.
If requests came from more than 50 countries, then you can't calculate Request % based on the data in this table because the Request Count column doesn't include all of the requests during the specified period.
Bytes
The number of bytes that CloudFront served to viewers in this country or state, for the specified distribution and period. To change the display of data in this column to KB, MB, or GB, click the link in the column heading.
