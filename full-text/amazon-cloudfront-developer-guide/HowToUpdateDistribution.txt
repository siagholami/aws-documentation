Updating a Distribution
In the CloudFront console, you can see the CloudFront distributions that are associated with your AWS account, view the settings for a distribution, and update most settings. Be aware that settings changes that you make won't take effect until the distribution has propagated to the AWS edge locations.
To Update a CloudFront Distribution


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/.


Select the ID of a distribution. The list includes all of the distributions associated with the AWS account that you used to sign in to the CloudFront console.


To edit settings for a distribution, choose the Distribution Settings tab.


To make updates, do one of the following:


To update general settings, choose Edit. Otherwise, choose the tab for the settings that you want to update: Origins or Behaviors.


For settings for an RTMP distribution, choose Edit, and then update values.
For information about the fields, see Values that You Specify When You Create or Update an RTMP Distribution.


Make the updates, and then, to save your changes, choose Yes, Edit. For information about the fields, see the following topics: 
    General settings: Distribution Settings
    Origin settings: Origin Settings
    Cache behavior settings: Cache Behavior Settings


If you want to delete an origin in your distribution, do the following:


Choose Behaviors, and then make sure you have moved any default cache behaviors associated with the origin to another origin.


Choose Origins, and then select an origin.


Choose Delete.


You can also update a distribution by using the CloudFront API:
 To update a distribution, see UpdateDistribution in the Amazon CloudFront API Reference.
Important
When you update your distribution, be aware that a number of additional fields are required that are not required to create a distribution. For a summary of the fields required for when you create or update a distribution, see Required fields for creating and updating distributions. To help make sure that all of the required fields are included when you update a distribution by using the CloudFront API, follow the steps described in UpdateDistribution in the Amazon CloudFront API Reference.
When you save changes to your distribution configuration, CloudFront starts to propagate the changes to all edge locations. Until your configuration is updated in an edge location, CloudFront continues to serve your content from that location based on the previous configuration. After your configuration is updated in an edge location, CloudFront immediately starts to serve your content from that location based on the new configuration.
Your changes don't propagate to every edge location instantaneously. When propagation is complete, the status of your distribution changes from InProgress to Deployed. While CloudFront is propagating your changes, we unfortunately can't determine whether a given edge location is serving your content based on the previous configuration or the new configuration.
