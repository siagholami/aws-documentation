Monitoring CloudFront with Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudFront is integrated with Amazon CloudWatch, and automatically publishes six operational metrics per distribution, which are displayed in a set of graphs in the CloudFront console, or accessible by using the CloudFront API or CLI. Each Lambda@Edge function associated with a distribution also publishes operational metrics, some of which you can view in the CloudFront console. The CloudFront metrics don’t count against CloudWatch quotas (formerly known as limits) and don’t incur any additional cost.
In addition to the default metrics, you can enable additional metrics for an additional cost. The additional metrics apply to CloudFront distributions, and must be enabled for each distribution separately. For more information about the cost, see Estimating cost for the additional CloudFront metrics.
Viewing these metrics can help you troubleshoot, track, and debug issues. To view these metrics in the CloudFront console, see the Monitoring page. To view graphs about the activity for a specific CloudFront distribution or Lambda@Edge function, choose one, and then choose to view the metrics.
You can also set alarms based on these metrics in the CloudFront console, or in the CloudWatch console, API, or CLI (standard CloudWatch pricing applies). For example, you can set an alarm based on the 5xxErrorRate metric, which represents the percentage of all viewer requests for which the response’s HTTP status code is in the range of 500 to 599, inclusive. When the error rate reaches a certain value for a certain amount of time—for example, 5% of requests for 5 continuous minutes—the alarm is triggered. You specify the alarm’s value and its time unit when you create the alarm. For more information, see Setting alarms.
