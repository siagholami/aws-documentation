Delivering Live Streaming Video with CloudFront and AWS Media Services
To use AWS Media Services with CloudFront to deliver live content to a global audience, follow the guidance included in this section.
Use AWS Elemental MediaLive to encode live video streams in real time. To encode a large video stream, MediaLive compresses it into smaller versions (encodes) that can be distributed to your viewers.
After you compress a live video stream, you can use either of the following two main options to prepare and serve the content:
 Convert your content into required formats, and then serve it: If you require content in multiple formats, use AWS Elemental MediaPackage to package the content for different device types. When you package the content, you can also implement extra features and add digital rights management (DRM) to prevent unauthorized use of your content. For step-by-step instructions for using CloudFront to serve content that MediaPackage formatted, see Serving Live Video Formatted with AWS Elemental MediaPackage.
 Store and serve your content using scalable origin: If MediaLive encoded content in the formats required by all of the devices that your viewers use, use a highly scalable origin like AWS Elemental MediaStore to serve the content. For step-by-step instructions for using CloudFront to serve content that is stored in a MediaStore container, see Serving Video Using AWS Elemental MediaStore as the Origin.
After you’ve set up your origin by using one of these options, you can distribute live streaming video to viewers by using CloudFront.
Tip
You can learn about an AWS solution that automatically deploys services for building a highly available real-time viewing experience. To see the steps to automatically deploy this solution, see Live Streaming Automated Deployment.

Serving Video Using AWS Elemental MediaStore as the Origin
If you have video stored in an AWS Elemental MediaStore container, you can create a CloudFront distribution to serve the content.
To get started, you grant CloudFront access to your MediaStore container. Then you create a CloudFront distribution and configure it to work with MediaStore.
To serve content from an AWS Elemental MediaStore container


Follow the procedure at  Allowing Amazon CloudFront to Access Your MediaStore Container, and then return to these steps to create your distribution.


Create a distribution with the following settings:
Origin Domain Name
The data endpoint that is assigned to your MediaStore container. From the dropdown list, choose the MediaStore container for your live video. The format of a MediaStore origin is Container-OriginEndpointURL. For example, mymediastore.data.mediastore.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. For more information, see Origin Domain Name.
Origin Path
The folder structure in the MediaStore container where your objects are stored. For more information, see Origin Path.
Origin Custom Headers
Add header names and values if you want CloudFront to include custom headers when it forwards requests to your origin.
Viewer Protocol Policy
Choose Redirect HTTP to HTTPS. For more information, see Viewer Protocol Policy. 
Object Caching
If the encoder that you use can’t set cache controls on all objects, choose Customize. If your encoder can set cache controls on all objects, choose Origin Cache Headers. 
Minimum TTL, Maximum TTL, and Default TTL
Set as appropriate for your caching needs and segment durations.
Error Caching Minimum TTL
Set to 5 seconds or less, to help prevent serving stale content.


For the other settings, you can set specific values based on other technical requirements or the needs of your business. For a list of all the options for web distributions and information about setting them, see Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution.


After CloudFront provisions your distribution, edit the cache behavior to set up cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for your origin:


Select the distribution, and then choose Distribution Settings.


Choose Behaviors, select your origin, and then choose Edit.


Under Cache Based on Selected Request Headers, choose Whitelist, and then, under Whitelist Headers, select Origin.


To learn more about CORS, see Configuring CloudFront to Respect Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Settings in Caching Content Based on Request Headers.

For links in your application (for example, a media player), specify the name of the media file in the same format that you use for other objects that you're distributing using CloudFront.

Serving Live Video Formatted with AWS Elemental MediaPackage
If you formatted a live stream by using AWS Elemental MediaPackage, you can create a CloudFront distribution and configure cache behaviors to serve the live stream. The following process assumes that you have already  created a channel and added endpoints for your live video using MediaPackage.
Note
Instead of using the following process, you can choose to automatically create a CloudFront distribution when you save a channel in MediaPackage. For more information, see Creating a Distribution from AWS Elemental MediaPackage in the AWS Elemental MediaPackage User Guide.
To create a CloudFront distribution for MediaPackage manually, follow these steps:
Topics
 Step 1: Create and configure a CloudFront distribution
 Step 2: Add the other endpoints as origins
 Step 3: Configure cache behaviors for all endpoints
 Step 4: Use CloudFront to serve the live stream channel
Step 1: Create and configure a CloudFront distribution
Complete the following procedure to set up a CloudFront distribution for the live video channel that you created with MediaPackage.
To create a distribution for your live video channel


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/.


Choose Create Distribution.


On the Select a delivery method for your content page, in the Web section, choose Get Started.


Choose the settings for the distribution, including the following:
Origin Domain Name
The origin where your MediaPackage live video channel and endpoints are. Choose the text field, then from the dropdown list, choose the MediaPackage channel for your live video. You can map one channel to several origin endpoints.
If you created your channel using another AWS account, type the origin URL value into the field. The origin must be an HTTPS URL.
For more information, see Origin Domain Name in the Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution.
Origin Path
The path to the MediaPackage endpoint from where the content is served. When you choose an origin domain name, CloudFront populates the origin path.
If you used a channel from another AWS account for Origin Domain Name, the Origin Path field is not filled in for you. You must get the correct origin path from the other account so that you can enter it manually.
For more information about how an origin path works, see Origin Path in Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution.


For the other distribution settings, set specific values based on other technical requirements or the needs of your business. For a list of all the options for distributions and information about setting them, see Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution.
When you finish choosing the other distribution settings, choose Create Distribution.


Choose the distribution that you just created, then choose the Behaviors tab.


Choose the default cache behavior, and specify the correct cache behavior settings for the channel that you chose for the origin. Later, you’ll add one or more additional origins and edit cache behavior settings for them.


Go to the CloudFront Distributions page.


Wait until the value of the Status column for your distribution has changed from In Progress to Deployed, indicating that CloudFront has created your distribution.


Step 2: Add the other endpoints as origins
Repeat the steps here to add each of your MediaPackage channel endpoints to your distribution.
To add other endpoints as origins


On the CloudFront console, choose the distribution that you created for your channel.


Choose the Origins and Origin Groups tab, then choose Create Origin.


For Origin Domain Name, in the dropdown list, choose a MediaPackage endpoint for your channel. CloudFront automatically completes the Origin Path field.


For the other settings, set the values based on other technical requirements or the needs of your business. For more information, see Origin Settings in Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution.


Choose Create.


Step 3: Configure cache behaviors for all endpoints
For each endpoint, you must configure cache behaviors to add path patterns that route requests correctly. The path patterns that you specify depend on the video format that you’re serving. The following procedure includes the path pattern information to use for Apple HLS, CMAF, DASH, and Microsoft Smooth Streaming formats.
You typically set up two cache behaviors for each endpoint:
 The parent manifest, which is the index to your files.
 The segments, which are the files of the video content.
To create a cache behavior for an endpoint


On the CloudFront console, choose the distribution that you created for your channel.


Choose the Behaviors tab, then choose Create Behavior.


In the Cache Behavior Settings section, populate Path Pattern with the first pattern indicated in the following guidance for each endpoint type. For example, for a DASH endpoint, type *.mpd for Path Pattern.
Path Patterns
For an HLS endpoint, create the following two cache behaviors:
    For parent and child manifests, use *.m3u8.
    For the content segments, use *.ts.
For a CMAF endpoint, create the following two cache behaviors:
    For parent and child manifests, use *.m3u8.
    For the content segments, use *.mp4.
For a DASH endpoint, create the following two cache behaviors:
    For the parent manifest, use *.mpd.
    For the content segments, use *.mp4.
For a Microsoft Smooth Streaming endpoint, only a manifest is served, so you create only one cache behavior: index.ism/*.


For each cache behavior, specify values for the following settings:
Viewer Protocol Policy
Choose Redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
Cache Based on Selected Request Headers
Choose None (improves caching).
For more information about improving caching, see Increasing the Proportion of Requests that Are Served from CloudFront Edge Caches (Cache Hit Ratio).
Object Caching
MediaPackage sets default Cache-Control headers that ensure correct playback behavior. If you want to use those values, choose Use Origin Cache Headers. However, you can increase cache times for video segments. For more information about customizing the time that objects stay in the CloudFront cache, see Object Caching in the Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution.
Minimum TTL
Set to 5 seconds or less, to help prevent serving stale content.
Query String Forwarding and Caching
Choose Forward all, cache based on whitelist.
Query String Whitelist
Specify m as the query string parameter that you want CloudFront to use as the basis for caching. The MediaPackage response always includes the tag ?m=### to capture the modified time of the endpoint. If content is already cached with a different value for this tag, CloudFront requests a new manifest instead of serving the cached version.
If you’re using the time-shifted viewing functionality in MediaPackage, specify start and end as additional query string parameters on the cache behavior for manifest requests (*.m3u8, *.mpd, and index.ism/*). This way, content is served that’s specific to the requested time period in the manifest request. For more information about time-shifted viewing and formatting content start and end request parameters, see  Time-shifted Viewing in the AWS Elemental MediaPackage User Guide.
If you’re using the manifest filtering feature in MediaPackage, specify aws.manifestfilter as an additional query string parameter on the cache behavior for manifest requests (*.m3u8, *.mpd, and index.ism/*). This configures your distribution to forward the aws.manifestfilter query string to your MediaPackage origin, which is required for the manifest filtering feature to work. For more information, see Manifest Filtering in the AWS Elemental MediaPackage User Guide.


Choose Create.


If your endpoint is not a Microsoft Smooth Streaming endpoint, choose Create Behavior, and then repeat these steps to create a second cache behavior.


Step 4: Use CloudFront to serve the live stream channel
After you create the distribution, add the origins, and create the cache behaviors, you can serve the live stream channel using CloudFront. CloudFront routes requests from viewers to the correct MediaPackage endpoints based on the settings that you configured for the cache behaviors.
For links in your application (for example, a media player), specify the URL for the media file in the standard format for CloudFront URLs. For more information, see Customizing the URL Format for Files in CloudFront.
