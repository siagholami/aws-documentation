__call__(frame, comparison_dict, name1="frame1", name2="frame2", transformation_ctx = "", info = None, stageThreshold = 0, totalThreshold = 0)
Splits one or more rows in a DynamicFrame off into a new DynamicFrame.
 frame – The source DynamicFrame to split into two new ones (required).
 comparison_dict – A dictionary where the key is the full path to a column, and the value is another dictionary mapping comparators to the value to which the column values are compared. For example, {"age": {">": 10, "<": 20}} splits rows where the value of "age" is between 10 and 20, exclusive, from rows where "age" is outside that range (required).
 name1 – The name to assign to the DynamicFrame that will contain the rows to be split off (optional).
 name2 – The name to assign to the DynamicFrame that will contain the rows that remain after the specified rows are split off (optional).
 transformation_ctx – A unique string that is used to identify state information (optional).
 info – A string associated with errors in the transformation (optional).
 stageThreshold – The maximum number of errors that can occur in the transformation before it errors out (optional; the default is zero).
 totalThreshold – The maximum number of errors that can occur overall before processing errors out (optional; the default is zero).
Returns a DynamicFrameCollection that contains two DynamicFrames: one contains only the specified rows to be split, and the other contains all remaining rows.
