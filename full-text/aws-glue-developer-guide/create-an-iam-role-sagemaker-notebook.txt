Step 7: Create an IAM Role for Amazon SageMaker Notebooks
If you plan to use Amazon SageMaker notebooks with development endpoints, you need to grant the IAM role permissions. You provide those permissions by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), through an IAM role.
To create an IAM role for Amazon SageMaker notebooks


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Roles.


Choose Create role.


For role type, choose AWS Service, find and choose SageMaker, and then choose the SageMaker - Execution use case. Then choose Next: Permissions.


On the Attach permissions policy page, choose the policies that contain the required permissions; for example, AmazonSageMakerFullAccess.   Choose Next: Review.


If you plan to access Amazon S3 sources and targets that are encrypted with SSE-KMS, attach a policy that allows notebooks to decrypt the data, as shown in the following example. For more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS). 
{  
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement":[  
         {  
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":[  
               "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource":[  
               "arn:aws:kms:*:account-id-without-hyphens:key/key-id"
            ]
         }
      ]
   }

For Role name, enter a name for your role. To allow the role to be passed from console users to Amazon SageMaker, use a name that is prefixed with the string AWSGlueServiceSageMakerNotebookRole. AWS Glue provided policies expect IAM roles to begin with AWSGlueServiceSageMakerNotebookRole. Otherwise you must add a policy to your users to allow the iam:PassRole permission for IAM roles to match your naming convention. 

For example, enter AWSGlueServiceSageMakerNotebookRole-Default, and then choose Create role. 

After you create the role, attach the policy that allows additional permissions required to create Amazon SageMaker notebooks from AWS Glue.

Open the role that you just created, AWSGlueServiceSageMakerNotebookRole-Default, and choose Attach policies. Attach the policy that you created named AWSGlueSageMakerNotebook to the role.
