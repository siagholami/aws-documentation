Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch
You can monitor AWS Glue using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from AWS Glue into readable, near-real-time metrics. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks so that you can access historical information for a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing. By default, AWS Glue metrics data is sent to CloudWatch automatically. For more information, see What Is Amazon CloudWatch? in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide, and AWS Glue Metrics.
AWS Glue also supports real-time continuous logging for AWS Glue jobs. When continuous logging is enabled for a job, you can view the real-time logs on the AWS Glue console or the CloudWatch console dashboard. For more information, see Continuous Logging for AWS Glue Jobs.
