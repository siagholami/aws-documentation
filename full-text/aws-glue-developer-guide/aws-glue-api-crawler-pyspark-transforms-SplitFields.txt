__call__(frame, paths, name1 = None, name2 = None, transformation_ctx = "", info = "", stageThreshold = 0, totalThreshold = 0)
Splits one or more fields in a DynamicFrame off into a new DynamicFrame and creates another new DynamicFrame containing the fields that remain.
 frame – The source DynamicFrame to split into two new ones (required).
 paths – A list of full paths to the fields to be split (required).
 name1 – The name to assign to the DynamicFrame that will contain the fields to be split off (optional). If no name is supplied, the name of the source frame is used with "1" appended.
 name2 – The name to assign to the DynamicFrame that will contain the fields that remain after the specified fields are split off (optional). If no name is provided, the name of the source frame is used with "2" appended.
 transformation_ctx – A unique string that is used to identify state information (optional).
 info – A string associated with errors in the transformation (optional).
 stageThreshold – The maximum number of errors that can occur in the transformation before it errors out (optional; the default is zero).
 totalThreshold – The maximum number of errors that can occur overall before processing errors out (optional; the default is zero).
Returns a DynamicFrameCollection containing two DynamicFrames: one contains only the specified fields to split off, and the other contains the remaining fields.
