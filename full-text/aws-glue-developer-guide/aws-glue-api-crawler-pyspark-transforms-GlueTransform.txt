GlueTransform Base Class
The base class that all the awsglue.transforms classes inherit from.
The classes all define a __call__ method. They either override the GlueTransform class methods listed in the following sections, or they are called using the class name by default.
Methods

apply(cls, *args, **kwargs)
name(cls)
describeArgs(cls)
describeReturn(cls)
describeTransform(cls)
describeErrors(cls)
describe(cls)

apply(cls, *args, **kwargs)
Applies the transform by calling the transform class, and returns the result.
 cls – The self class object.
name(cls)
Returns the name of the derived transform class.
 cls – The self class object.
describeArgs(cls)

cls – The self class object.

Returns a list of dictionaries, each corresponding to a named argument, in the following format:
[
  {
    "name": "(name of argument)",
    "type": "(type of argument)",
    "description": "(description of argument)",
    "optional": "(Boolean, True if the argument is optional)",
    "defaultValue": "(Default value string, or None)(String; the default value, or None)"
  },
...
]
Raises a NotImplementedError exception when called in a derived transform where it is not implemented.
describeReturn(cls)

cls – The self class object.

Returns a dictionary with information about the return type, in the following format:
{
  "type": "(return type)",
  "description": "(description of output)"
}
Raises a NotImplementedError exception when called in a derived transform where it is not implemented.
describeTransform(cls)
Returns a string describing the transform.
 cls – The self class object.
Raises a NotImplementedError exception when called in a derived transform where it is not implemented.
describeErrors(cls)

cls – The self class object.

Returns a list of dictionaries, each describing a possible exception thrown by this transform, in the following format:
[
  {
    "type": "(type of error)",
    "description": "(description of error)"
  },
...
]
describe(cls)

cls – The self class object.

Returns an object with the following format:
{
  "transform" : {
    "name" : cls.name( ),
    "args" : cls.describeArgs( ),
    "returns" : cls.describeReturn( ),
    "raises" : cls.describeErrors( ),
    "location" : "internal"
  }
}
