   This role needs AWS Glue service role permissions to allow access to resources in AWS Glue. See Attach a Policy to IAM Users That Access AWS Glue.
   This role needs permission to your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) sources, targets, temporary directory, scripts, and any libraries used by the task run for this transform.
 GlueVersion – UTF-8 string, not less than 1 or more than 255 bytes long, matching the Custom string pattern #13.
This value determines which version of AWS Glue this machine learning transform is compatible with. Glue 1.0 is recommended for most customers. If the value is not set, the Glue compatibility defaults to Glue 0.9. For more information, see AWS Glue Versions in the developer guide.
 MaxCapacity – Number (double).
The number of AWS Glue data processing units (DPUs) that are allocated to task runs for this transform. You can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the AWS Glue pricing page. 
MaxCapacity is a mutually exclusive option with NumberOfWorkers and WorkerType.
   If either NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType is set, then MaxCapacity cannot be set.
   If MaxCapacity is set then neither NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType can be set.
   If WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice versa).
   MaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.
When the WorkerType field is set to a value other than Standard, the MaxCapacity field is set automatically and becomes read-only.
 WorkerType – UTF-8 string (valid values: Standard="" | G.1X="" | G.2X="").
The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a task of this transform runs. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.
   For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.
   For the G.1X worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.
   For the G.2X worker type, each worker provides 8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.
MaxCapacity is a mutually exclusive option with NumberOfWorkers and WorkerType.

   If MaxCapacity is set then neither NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType can be set.
   If WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice versa).
   MaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.
 NumberOfWorkers – Number (integer).
The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated when a task of the transform runs.
If WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice versa).
 Timeout – Number (integer), at least 1.
The timeout in minutes of the machine learning transform.
 MaxRetries – Number (integer).
The maximum number of times to retry after an MLTaskRun of the machine learning transform fails.
FindMatchesParameters Structure
The parameters to configure the find matches transform.
Fields
 PrimaryKeyColumnName – UTF-8 string, not less than 1 or more than 1024 bytes long, matching the Single-line string pattern.
The name of a column that uniquely identifies rows in the source table. Used to help identify matching records.
 PrecisionRecallTradeoff – Number (double), not more than 1.0.
The value selected when tuning your transform for a balance between precision and recall. A value of 0.5 means no preference; a value of 1.0 means a bias purely for precision, and a value of 0.0 means a bias for recall. Because this is a tradeoff, choosing values close to 1.0 means very low recall, and choosing values close to 0.0 results in very low precision.
The precision metric indicates how often your model is correct when it predicts a match. 
The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how often your model predicts the match.
 AccuracyCostTradeoff – Number (double), not more than 1.0.
The value that is selected when tuning your transform for a balance between accuracy and cost. A value of 0.5 means that the system balances accuracy and cost concerns. A value of 1.0 means a bias purely for accuracy, which typically results in a higher cost, sometimes substantially higher. A value of 0.0 means a bias purely for cost, which results in a less accurate FindMatches transform, sometimes with unacceptable accuracy.
Accuracy measures how well the transform finds true positives and true negatives. Increasing accuracy requires more machine resources and cost. But it also results in increased recall. 
Cost measures how many compute resources, and thus money, are consumed to run the transform.
 EnforceProvidedLabels – Boolean.
The value to switch on or off to force the output to match the provided labels from users. If the value is True, the find matches transform forces the output to match the provided labels. The results override the normal conflation results. If the value is False, the find matches transform does not ensure all the labels provided are respected, and the results rely on the trained model.
Note that setting this value to true may increase the conflation execution time.
FindMatchesMetrics Structure
The evaluation metrics for the find matches algorithm. The quality of your machine learning transform is measured by getting your transform to predict some matches and comparing the results to known matches from the same dataset. The quality metrics are based on a subset of your data, so they are not precise.
Fields
 AreaUnderPRCurve – Number (double), not more than 1.0.
The area under the precision/recall curve (AUPRC) is a single number measuring the overall quality of the transform, that is independent of the choice made for precision vs. recall. Higher values indicate that you have a more attractive precision vs. recall tradeoff.
For more information, see Precision and recall in Wikipedia.
 Precision – Number (double), not more than 1.0.
The precision metric indicates when often your transform is correct when it predicts a match. Specifically, it measures how well the transform finds true positives from the total true positives possible.
For more information, see Precision and recall in Wikipedia.
 Recall – Number (double), not more than 1.0.
The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how often your transform predicts the match. Specifically, it measures how well the transform finds true positives from the total records in the source data.
For more information, see Precision and recall in Wikipedia.
 F1 – Number (double), not more than 1.0.
The maximum F1 metric indicates the transform's accuracy between 0 and 1, where 1 is the best accuracy.
For more information, see F1 score in Wikipedia.
 ConfusionMatrix – A ConfusionMatrix object.

 WorkerType – UTF-8 string (valid values: Standard="" | G.1X="" | G.2X="").
The type of predefined worker that is allocated when this task runs. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.
   For the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.
   For the G.1X worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.
   For the G.2X worker type, each worker provides 8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.
 NumberOfWorkers – Number (integer).
The number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated when this task runs.
 Timeout – Number (integer), at least 1.
The timeout for a task run for this transform in minutes. This is the maximum time that a task run for this transform can consume resources before it is terminated and enters TIMEOUT status. The default is 2,880 minutes (48 hours).
 MaxRetries – Number (integer).
The maximum number of times to retry a task for this transform after a task run fails.

StartExportLabelsTaskRun Action (Python: start_export_labels_task_run)
Begins an asynchronous task to export all labeled data for a particular transform. This task is the only label-related API call that is not part of the typical active learning workflow. You typically use StartExportLabelsTaskRun when you want to work with all of your existing labels at the same time, such as when you want to remove or change labels that were previously submitted as truth. This API operation accepts the TransformId whose labels you want to export and an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path to export the labels to. The operation returns a TaskRunId. You can check on the status of your task run by calling the GetMLTaskRun API.
Request
 TransformId – Required: UTF-8 string, not less than 1 or more than 255 bytes long, matching the Single-line string pattern.
The unique identifier of the machine learning transform.
 OutputS3Path – Required: UTF-8 string.

StartImportLabelsTaskRun Action (Python: start_import_labels_task_run)
Enables you to provide additional labels (examples of truth) to be used to teach the machine learning transform and improve its quality. This API operation is generally used as part of the active learning workflow that starts with the StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun call and that ultimately results in improving the quality of your machine learning transform. 
After the StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun finishes, AWS Glue machine learning will have generated a series of questions for humans to answer. (Answering these questions is often called 'labeling' in the machine learning workflows). In the case of the FindMatches transform, these questions are of the form, "What is the correct way to group these rows together into groups composed entirely of matching records?" After the labeling process is finished, users upload their answers/labels with a call to StartImportLabelsTaskRun. After StartImportLabelsTaskRun finishes, all future runs of the machine learning transform use the new and improved labels and perform a higher-quality transformation.
By default, StartMLLabelingSetGenerationTaskRun continually learns from and combines all labels that you upload unless you set Replace to true. If you set Replace to true, StartImportLabelsTaskRun deletes and forgets all previously uploaded labels and learns only from the exact set that you upload. Replacing labels can be helpful if you realize that you previously uploaded incorrect labels, and you believe that they are having a negative effect on your transform quality.
You can check on the status of your task run by calling the GetMLTaskRun operation. 
Request
 TransformId – Required: UTF-8 string, not less than 1 or more than 255 bytes long, matching the Single-line string pattern.
The unique identifier of the machine learning transform.
 InputS3Path – Required: UTF-8 string.
