Accessing Your Development Endpoint
When you create a development endpoint in a virtual private cloud (VPC), AWS Glue returns only a private IP address. The public IP address field is not populated. When you create a non-VPC development endpoint, AWS Glue returns only a public IP address.
If your development endpoint has a Public address, confirm that it is reachable with the SSH private key for the development endpoint, as in the following example.
ssh -i dev-endpoint-private-key.pem glue@public-address
Suppose that your development endpoint has a Private address, your VPC subnet is routable from the public internet, and its security groups allow inbound access from your client. In this case, follow these steps to attach an Elastic IP address to a development endpoint to allow access from the internet.
Note
If you want to use Elastic IP addresses, the subnet that is being used requires an internet gateway associated through the route table.
To access a development endpoint by attaching an Elastic IP address


Open the AWS Glue console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/.


In the navigation pane, choose Dev endpoints, and navigate to the development endpoint details page. Record the Private address for use in the next step. 


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, under Network & Security, choose Network Interfaces. 


Search for the Private DNS (IPv4) that corresponds to the Private address on the AWS Glue console development endpoint details page. 


You might need to modify which columns are displayed on your Amazon EC2 console. Note the Network interface ID (ENI) for this address (for example, eni-12345678).


On the Amazon EC2 console, under Network & Security, choose Elastic IPs. 


Choose Allocate new address, and then choose Allocate to allocate a new Elastic IP address.


On the Elastic IPs page, choose the newly allocated Elastic IP. Then choose Actions, Associate address.


On the Associate address page, do the following:
    For Resource type, choose Network interface.
    In the Network interface box, enter the Network interface ID (ENI) for the private address.
    Choose Associate.


Confirm that the newly associated Elastic IP address is reachable with the SSH private key that is associated with the development endpoint, as in the following example. 


ssh -i dev-endpoint-private-key.pem glue@elastic-ip
For information about using a bastion host to get SSH access to the development endpointâ€™s private address, see the AWS Security Blog post Securely Connect to Linux Instances Running in a Private Amazon VPC.
