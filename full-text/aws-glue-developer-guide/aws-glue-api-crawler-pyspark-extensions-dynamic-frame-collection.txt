DynamicFrameCollection Class
A DynamicFrameCollection is a dictionary of DynamicFrame Class objects, in which the keys are the names of the DynamicFrames and the values are the DynamicFrame objects.
__init__
__init__(dynamic_frames, glue_ctx)
 dynamic_frames – A dictionary of DynamicFrame Class objects.
 glue_ctx – A GlueContext Class object.
keys
keys( ) – Returns a list of the keys in this collection, which generally consists of the names of the corresponding DynamicFrame values.
values
values(key) – Returns a list of the DynamicFrame values in this collection.
select
select(key)
Returns the DynamicFrame that corresponds to the specfied key (which is generally the name of the DynamicFrame).
 key – A key in the DynamicFrameCollection, which usually represents the name of a DynamicFrame.
map
map(callable, transformation_ctx="")
Uses a passed-in function to create and return a new DynamicFrameCollection based on the DynamicFrames in this collection.
 callable – A function that takes a DynamicFrame and the specified transformation context as parameters and returns a DynamicFrame.
 transformation_ctx – A transformation context to be used by the callable (optional).
flatmap
flatmap(f, transformation_ctx="")
Uses a passed-in function to create and return a new DynamicFrameCollection based on the DynamicFrames in this collection.
 f – A function that takes a DynamicFrame as a parameter and returns a DynamicFrame or DynamicFrameCollection.
 transformation_ctx – A transformation context to be used by the function (optional).
