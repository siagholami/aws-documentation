Viewing Continuous Logging for AWS Glue Jobs
You can view real-time logs using the AWS Glue console or the Amazon CloudWatch console.
To view real-time logs using the AWS Glue console dashboard


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Glue console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/.


In the navigation pane, choose Jobs.


Add or start an existing job. Choose Action, Run job.


When you start running a job, you navigate to a page that contains information about the running job:
    The Logs tab shows the older aggregated application logs.
    The Continuous logging tab shows a real-time progress bar when the job is running with glueContext initialized.
    The Continuous logging tab also contains the Driver logs, which capture real-time Apache Spark driver logs, and application logs from the script logged using the AWS Glue application logger when the job is running.

For older jobs, you can also view the real-time logs under the Job History view by choosing Logs. This action takes you to the CloudWatch console that shows all Spark driver, executor, and progress bar log streams for that job run.

To view real-time logs using the CloudWatch console dashboard


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Log.


Choose the /aws-glue/jobs/logs-v2/ log group.


In the Filter box, paste the job run ID.


You can view the driver logs, executor logs, and progress bar (if using the Standard filter).
