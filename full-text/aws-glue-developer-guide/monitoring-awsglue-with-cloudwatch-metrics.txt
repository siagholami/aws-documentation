Monitoring AWS Glue Using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics
You can profile and monitor AWS Glue operations using AWS Glue job profiler. It collects and processes raw data from AWS Glue jobs into readable, near real-time metrics stored in Amazon CloudWatch. These statistics are retained and aggregated in CloudWatch so that you can access historical information for a better perspective on how your application is performing.
AWS Glue Metrics Overview
When you interact with AWS Glue, it sends metrics to CloudWatch. You can view these metrics using the AWS Glue console (the preferred method), the CloudWatch console dashboard, or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). 
To view metrics using the AWS Glue console dashboard
You can view summary or detailed graphs of metrics for a job, or detailed graphs for a job run. For details about the graphs and metrics you can access in the AWS Glue console dashboard, see Working with Jobs on the AWS Glue Console.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Glue console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/.


In the navigation pane, choose Jobs.


Select a job from the Jobs list.


Choose the Metrics tab.


Choose View additional metrics to see more detailed metrics.


To view metrics using the CloudWatch console dashboard
Metrics are grouped first by the service namespace, and then by the various dimension combinations within each namespace.


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Metrics.


Choose the Glue namespace.


To view metrics using the AWS CLI
 At a command prompt, use the following command.
1. aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "Glue"
AWS Glue reports metrics to CloudWatch every 30 seconds, and the CloudWatch metrics dashboards are configured to display them every minute. The AWS Glue metrics represent delta values from the previously reported values. Where appropriate, metrics dashboards aggregate (sum) the 30-second values to obtain a value for the entire last minute. AWS Glue metrics are enabled at initialization of a GlueContext in a script and are generally updated only at the end of an Apache Spark task. They represent the aggregate values across all completed Spark tasks so far.
However, the Spark metrics that AWS Glue passes on to CloudWatch are generally absolute values representing the current state at the time they are reported. AWS Glue reports them to CloudWatch every 30 seconds, and the metrics dashboards generally show the average across the data points received in the last 1 minute.
AWS Glue metrics names are all preceded by one of the following types of prefix:
 glue.driver. – Metrics whose names begin with this prefix either represent AWS Glue metrics that are aggregated from all executors at the Spark driver, or Spark metrics corresponding to the Spark driver.
 glue.executorId. – The executorId is the number of a specific Spark executor. It corresponds with the executors listed in the logs.
 glue.ALL. – Metrics whose names begin with this prefix aggregate values from all Spark executors.
AWS Glue Metrics
AWS Glue profiles and sends the following metrics to CloudWatch every 30 seconds, and the AWS Glue Metrics Dashboard report them once a minute:
