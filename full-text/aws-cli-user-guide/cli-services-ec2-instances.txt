Launching, listing, and terminating Amazon EC2 instances
You can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to launch, list, and terminate Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. You need a key pair and a security group. You also need to select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and make a note of the AMI ID. For more information, see Finding a Suitable AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
If you launch an instance that isn't within the AWS Free Tier, you are billed after you launch the instance and charged for the time that the instance is running, even if it remains idle.
Note
The following examples assume that you have already configured your default credentials.

Launch your instance
To launch an Amazon EC2 instance using the AMI you selected, use the run-instances command. You can launch the instance into a virtual private cloud (VPC), or if your account supports it, into EC2-Classic.
Initially, your instance appears in the pending state, but changes to the running state after a few minutes.
EC2-VPC
The following example shows how to launch a t2.micro instance in the specified subnet of a VPC. Replace the italicized parameter values with your own.
$ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-xxxxxxxx --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name MyKeyPair --security-group-ids sg-903004f8 --subnet-id subnet-6e7f829e

Add a block device to your instance
Each instance that you launch has an associated root device volume. You can use block device mapping to specify additional Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes or instance store volumes to attach to an instance when it's launched.
To add a block device to your instance, specify the --block-device-mappings option when you use run-instances.
The following example parameter provisions a standard Amazon EBS volume that is 20 GB in size, and maps it to your instance using the identifier /dev/sdf.
--block-device-mappings "[{\"DeviceName\":\"/dev/sdf\",\"Ebs\":{\"VolumeSize\":20,\"DeleteOnTermination\":false}}]"
The following example adds an Amazon EBS volume, mapped to /dev/sdf, based on an existing snapshot. A snapshot represents an image that is loaded onto the volume for you. When you specify a snapshot, you don't have to specify a volume size; it will be large enough to hold your image. However, if you do specify a size, it must be greater than or equal to the size of the snapshot.
--block-device-mappings "[{\"DeviceName\":\"/dev/sdf\",\"Ebs\":{\"SnapshotId\":\"snap-a1b2c3d4\"}}]"
The following example adds two volumes to your instance. The number of volumes available to your instance depends on its instance type.
--block-device-mappings "[{\"DeviceName\":\"/dev/sdf\",\"VirtualName\":\"ephemeral0\"},{\"DeviceName\":\"/dev/sdg\",\"VirtualName\":\"ephemeral1\"}]"
The following example creates the mapping (/dev/sdj), but doesn't provision a volume for the instance.
--block-device-mappings "[{\"DeviceName\":\"/dev/sdj\",\"NoDevice\":\"\"}]"
For more information, see Block Device Mapping in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Add a tag to your instance
A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. It enables you to add metadata to your resources that you can use for a variety of purposes. For more information, see Tagging Your Resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
The following example shows how to add a tag with the key name "Name and the value "MyInstance" to the specified instance, by using the create-tags command.
$ aws ec2 create-tags --resources i-5203422c --tags Key=Name,Value=MyInstance
Connect to your instance
When your instance is running, you can connect to it and use it just as you'd use a computer sitting in front of you. For more information, see Connect to Your Amazon EC2 Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
List your instances
You can use the AWS CLI to list your instances and view information about them. You can list all your instances, or filter the results based on the instances that you're interested in.
The following examples show how to use the describe-instances command.
The following command filters the list to only your t2.micro instances and outputs only the InstanceId values for each match.
$ aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-type,Values=t2.micro" --query "Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId"
[
    "i-05e998023d9c69f9a"
]
The following command lists any of your instances that have the tag Name=MyInstance.
$ aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=MyInstance"
The following command lists your instances that were launched using any of the following AMIs: ami-x0123456, ami-y0123456, and ami-z0123456.
$ aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=image-id,Values=ami-x0123456,ami-y0123456,ami-z0123456"
Terminate your instance
Terminating an instance deletes it. You can't reconnect to an instance after you've terminated it. 
As soon as the state of the instance changes to shutting-down or terminated, you stop incurring charges for that instance. If you want to reconnect to an instance later, use stop-instances instead of terminate-instances. For more information, see Terminate Your Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
When you finish with an instance, you can use the command terminate-instances to delete it.
$ aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-5203422c

        {
            "InstanceId": "i-5203422c",
