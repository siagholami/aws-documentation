Installing the AWS CLI version 1
This topic provides links to information about how to install version 1 of the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For information on the latest releases of AWS CLI version 1, see the AWS CLI version 1 change notes on GitHub.
We recommend that you use AWS CLI version 2 instead. For information about how to install version 2, see Installing the AWS CLI version 2.
Important
AWS CLI version 1 no longer supports Python versions 2.6 and 3.3. All versions of the AWS CLI version 1 released after January 10th, 2020, starting with 1.17, require Python 2.7, Python 3.4, or a later version.
This change does not affect the Windows MSI installer version of the AWS CLI version 1 and the AWS CLI version 2.
For more information, see Using the AWS CLI version 1 with earlier versions of Python in this guide, and the deprecation announcement blog post.
