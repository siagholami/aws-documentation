Install and update the AWS CLI version 1 in a virtual environment

Install virtualenv using pip.

$ pip install --user virtualenv

Create a virtual environment and name it.

$ virtualenv ~/cli-ve
Alternatively, you can use the -p option to specify a version of Python other than the default.
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python37 ~/cli-ve

Activate your new virtual environment.

Linux or macOS
$ source ~/cli-ve/bin/activate
Windows
$ %USERPROFILE%\cli-ve\Scripts\activate
The prompt changes to show that your virtual environment is active.
(cli-ve)~$

Install or update the AWS CLI version 1 into your virtual environment.

(cli-ve)~$ pip install --upgrade awscli

Verify that the AWS CLI version 1 is installed correctly.

$ aws --version
   aws-cli/1.18.134 Python/3.7.4 Linux/4.14.133-113.105.amzn2.x86_64 botocore/1.13

You can use the deactivate command to exit the virtual environment. Whenever you start a new session, you must reactivate the environment.
