Create a topic
To create a topic, use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/create-topic.html command and specify the name to assign to the topic.
$ aws sns create-topic --name my-topic
{
    "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic"
}
Make a note of the response's TopicArn, which you use later to publish a message.
Subscribe to a topic
To subscribe to a topic, use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/subscribe.html command. 
The following example specifies the email protocol and an email address for the notification-endpoint.
$ aws sns subscribe --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic --protocol email --notification-endpoint saanvi@example.com
{
    "SubscriptionArn": "pending confirmation"
}
AWS immediately sends a confirmation message by email to the address you specified in the subscribe command. The email message has the following text.
You have chosen to subscribe to the topic:
arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic
To confirm this subscription, click or visit the following link (If this was in error no action is necessary):
Confirm subscription
After the recipient clicks the Confirm subscription link, the recipient's browser displays a notification message with information similar to the following.
```
Subscription confirmed!
You have subscribed saanvi@example.com to the topic:my-topic.
Your subscription's id is:
arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic:1328f057-de93-4c15-512e-8bb22EXAMPLE
If it was not your intention to subscribe, click here to unsubscribe.
```
Publish to a topic
To send a message to all subscribers of a topic, use the publish command. 
The following example sends the message "Hello World!" to all subscribers of the specified topic.
$ aws sns publish --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic --message "Hello World!"
{
    "MessageId": "4e41661d-5eec-5ddf-8dab-2c867EXAMPLE"
}
In this example, AWS sends an email message with the text "Hello World!" to saanvi@example.com.
Unsubscribe from a topic
To unsubscribe from a topic and stop receiving messages published to that topic, use the unsubscribe command and specify the ARN of the topic you want to unsubscribe from.
$ aws sns unsubscribe --subscription-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic:1328f057-de93-4c15-512e-8bb22EXAMPLE
To verify that you successfully unsubscribed, use the list-subscriptions command to confirm that the ARN no longer appears in the list.
$ aws sns list-subscriptions
Delete a topic
To delete a topic, run the delete-topic command.
$ aws sns delete-topic --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic
To verify that AWS successfully deleted the topic, use the list-topics command to confirm that the topic no longer appears in the list.
$ aws sns list-topics
