Attaching an IAM managed policy to an IAM user
This topic describes how to use AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) commands to attach an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to an IAM user. The policy in this example provides the user with "Power User Access". For more information on the IAM service, see the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
Before you run any commands, set your default credentials. For more information, see Configuring the AWS CLI.
To attach an IAM managed policy to an IAM user

Determine the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy to attach. The following command uses list-policies to find the ARN of the policy with the name PowerUserAccess. It then stores that ARN in an environment variable.

$ export POLICYARN=$(aws iam list-policies --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`PowerUserAccess`].{ARN:Arn}' --output text)       ~
   $ echo $POLICYARN
   arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess

To attach the policy, use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/attach-user-policy.html command, and reference the environment variable that holds the policy ARN.

$ aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name MyUser --policy-arn $POLICYARN

Verify that the policy is attached to the user by running the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/list-attached-user-policies.html command.

$ aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name MyUser
   {
       "AttachedPolicies": [
           {
               "PolicyName": "PowerUserAccess",
               "PolicyArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess"
           }
       ]
   }
