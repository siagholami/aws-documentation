Logging and monitoring in AWS Control Tower
Monitoring allows you to plan for and respond to potential incidents. Therefore, monitoring is an important part of the well-architected nature of AWS Control Tower. The results of monitoring activities are stored in log files; therefore, logging and monitoring are closely related concepts.
When you set up your landing zone, one of the shared accounts created is the log archive account, dedicated to collecting all logs centrally, including logs for all of your other accounts. These log files allow administrators and auditors to review actions and events that have occurred. 
As a best practice, you should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution into your logs, so that you can more easily debug a multi-point failure if one occurs. AWS provides several tools for monitoring your resources and activity in your landing zone.
For example, the status of your guardrails is monitored constantly. You can see their status at a glance in the AWS Control Tower console. The health and status of the accounts you provisioned in Account Factory also is monitored constantly.
