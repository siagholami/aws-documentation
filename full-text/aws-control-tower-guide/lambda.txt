Run Serverless Compute Functions with Lambda
With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend serviceâ€”all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.
