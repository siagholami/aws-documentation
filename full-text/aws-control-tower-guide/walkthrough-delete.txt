Walkthrough: Cleaning up AWS Control Tower Managed Resources
When your landing zone was set up, AWS Control Tower provisioned resources and services in your landing zone on your behalf. For example, an AWS Organizations organization with multiple accounts and organizational units (OUs) were provisioned. Additionally, guardrails were deployed in your accounts using AWS CloudFormation stacks, stack sets, and AWS Organizations policies.
This document provides instructions for how to delete AWS Control Tower resources individually, as part of regular maintenance and administrative tasks. The procedures given in this chapter are intended only for removing individual resources, or a few resources, when needed. 
Warning
If you intend to decommission your landing zone, contact AWS Support first, before manually deleting resources. Manually deleting resources will not allow you to set up a new landing zone. It is not the same as decommissioning. Complete decommissioning requires assistance from AWS Support.
If you delete all of your landing zone resources manually, it is not the same as decommissioning the landing zone, and you may incur unexpected charges.
Manual Cleanup of AWS Control Tower Resources
The following procedures guide you through manual methods of cleaning up AWS Control Tower resources. These procedures can be followed any time you need to delete resources from you landing zone. Two types of tasks may require cleanup of resources:
 To delete resources as you manage your landing zone in ordinary situations.
 To clean up resources that remain after automated decommissioning, in cooperation with AWS Support.
Before performing these procedures, unless it's otherwise indicated, you must be signed in to the AWS Management Console in the home Region for your landing zone, and you must be signed in as an IAM user with administrative permissions for the master account that contains your landing zone.
Warning
These are destructive actions that can introduce governance drift into your AWS Control Tower setup. They cannot be undone.
