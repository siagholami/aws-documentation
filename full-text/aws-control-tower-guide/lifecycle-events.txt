Lifecycle Events in AWS Control Tower
Some events logged by AWS Control Tower are lifecycle events. A lifecycle event's purpose is to mark the completion of certain AWS Control Tower actions that change the state of resources. Lifecycle events apply to resources that AWS Control Tower creates or manages, such as organizational units (OUs), accounts, and guardrails.
Characteristics of AWS Control Tower lifecycle events
 For each lifecycle event, the event log shows whether the originating Control Tower action completed successfully, or failed.
 AWS CloudTrail automatically records each lifecycle event as a non-API AWS service event. For more information, see  the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
 Each lifecycle event also is delivered to the Amazon EventBridge and Amazon CloudWatch Events services. 
Lifecycle events in AWS Control Tower offer two primary benefits:
 Because a lifecycle event registers the completion of an AWS Control Tower action, you can create an Amazon EventBridge rule or Amazon CloudWatch Events rule that can trigger the next steps in your automation workflow, based on the state of the lifecycle event.
 The logs provide additional detail to assist administrators and auditors in reviewing certain types of activity in your organizations. 
How lifecycle events work
AWS Control Tower relies upon multiple services to implement its actions. Therefore, each lifecycle event is recorded only after a series of actions is complete. For example, when you enable a guardrail on an OU, AWS Control Tower launches a series of sub-steps that implement the request. The final result of the entire series of sub-steps is recorded in the log as the state of the lifecycle event.
 If every underlying sub-step has completed successfully, the lifecycle event state is recorded as Succeeded.
 If any of the underlying sub-steps did not complete successfully, the lifecycle event state is recorded as Failed.
Each lifecycle event includes a logged timestamp that shows when the AWS Control Tower action was initiated, and another timestamp showing when the lifecycle event is completed, marking success or failure.
Viewing lifecycle events in Control Tower
You can view lifecycle events from the Activities page in your AWS Control Tower dashboard.
 To navigate to the Activities page, choose Activities from the left navigation pane.
 To get more details about a specific event, select the event and then choose the View details button at the upper right.
For more information about how to integrate AWS Control Tower lifecycle events into your workflows, see this blog post, Using lifecycle events to track AWS Control Tower actions and trigger automated workflows.
Lifecycle event names
Each lifecycle event is named so that it corresponds to the originating AWS Control Tower action, which also is recorded by AWS CloudTrail. Thus, for example, a lifecycle event originated by the AWS Control Tower CreateManagedAccount CloudTrail event is named CreateManagedAccount.
Each name in the list that follows is a link to an example of the logged detail in JSON format. The additional detail shown in these examples is taken from the Amazon CloudWatch event logs.
Although JSON does not support comments, some comments have been added in the examples for explanatory purposes. Comments are preceded by "//" and they appear in the right side of the examples.
In these examples, some account names and organization names are obscured. An accountId is always a 12-number sequence, which has been replaced with "xxxxxxxxxxxx" in the examples. An organizationalUnitID is a unique string of letters and numbers. Its form is preserved in the examples.
 CreateManagedAccount: The log records whether AWS Control Tower successfully completed every action to create and provision a new account using account factory.
 UpdateManagedAccount: The log records whether AWS Control Tower successfully completed every action to update a provisioned product that's associated with an account you had previously created by using account factory.
 EnableGuardrail: The log records whether AWS Control Tower successfully completed every action to enable a guardrail on an OU that was created by AWS Control Tower.
 DisableGuardrail: The log records whether AWS Control Tower successfully completed every action to disable a guardrail on an OU that was created by AWS Control Tower.
 SetupLandingZone: The log records whether AWS Control Tower successfully completed every action to set up a landing zone.
 UpdateLandingZone: The log records whether AWS Control Tower successfully completed every action to update your existing landing zone.
 RegisterOrganizationalUnit: The log records whether AWS Control Tower successfully completed every action to enable its governance features on an OU. 
 DeregisterOrganizationalUnit: The log records whether AWS Control Tower successfully completed every action to disable its governance features on an OU.
The following sections provide a list of AWS Control Tower lifecycle events, with examples of the details logged for each type of lifecycle event.
CreateManagedAccount
This lifecycle event records whether AWS Control Tower successfully created and provisioned a new account using account factory. This event corresponds to the AWS Control Tower CreateManagedAccount CloudTrail event. The lifecycle event log includes the accountName and accountId of the newly-created account, and the organizationalUnitName and organizationalUnitId of the OU in which the account has been placed.
