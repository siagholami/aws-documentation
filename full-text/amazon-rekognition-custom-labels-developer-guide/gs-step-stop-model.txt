Step 11: Stop Your Model
You are charged for the amount of time your model is running. If you have finished using the model, you should stop it. The console provides example code that you use to stop the model. For more information, see Running a Trained Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Model. 
To run the example code, you need to set up the AWS SDK. For more information, see Step 2: Set Up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs.
Stopping a model takes a while to complete. Check the console to determine if the model is running. Alternatively you can use the DescribeProjectVersions API to get the current status.
To stop a model (console)


On the Projects resources page, choose the project that contains the trained model that you want to stop.


In the Models section, choose the model that you want to stop. The summary results are shown. 


In the Use model section, choose API Code. 


At the command prompt, use the AWS CLI command that calls stop-project-version. It should look similar to the following example. The value of --project-version-arn should be Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your model. For more information, see Step 8: Stop Your Model.


aws rekognition stop-project-version \
     --project-version-arn "model_arn" \
     --region us-east-1


Choose your project name at the top of the page to go back to the project overview page.


In the Model section, check the status of the model. The model has successfully stopped when the status is The model is ready to run.
