Deleting an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Model
You can delete a model by using the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console or by using the DeleteProjectVersion API. You can't delete a model if it is running or if it is training. To stop a running model, use the StopProjectVersion API. For more information, see Stopping an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Model (SDK). If a model is training, wait until it finishes before you delete the model.
A deleted model can't be undeleted.

The following procedure shows how to delete a model(s) from a project details page. You can also delete a model from a model's detail page.  
To delete a model (console)


Open the Amazon Rekognition console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/.


Choose Use Custom Labels.


Choose Get started. 


In the left navigation pane, choose Projects.


Choose the project that contains the model that you want to delete. The project details page opens.


In the Models section, select the model(s) that you want to delete.
Note
If the model can't be selected, the model is either running or is training, and can't be deleted. Check the Status field and try again after stopping the running model, or wait until training finishes. 



Choose Delete model and the Delete model dialog box is shown.


Enter delete to confirm deletion. 


Choose Delete to delete the model. Deleting the model might take a while to complete.
Note
If you Close the dialog box during model deletion, the models are still deleted.



Deleting an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Model (SDK)
You delete an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model by calling DeleteProjectVersion and supplying the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model that you want to delete. You can get the model ARN from the Use your model section of the model details page in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console. Alternatively, call DescribeProjectVersions and supply the following.
 The ARN of the project (ProjectArn) that the model is associated with.
 The version name (VersionNames) of the model. 
The model ARN is the ProjectVersionArn field in the ProjectVersionDescription object, from the DescribeProjectVersions response.
You can't delete a model if it is running or is training. To determine if the model is running or training, call DescribeProjectVersions and check the Status field of the model's ProjectVersionDescription object. To stop a running model, use the StopProjectVersion API. For more information, see Stopping an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Model (SDK). You have to wait for a model to finishing training before you can delete it.

If you haven't already:


Create or update an IAM user with AmazonRekognitionFullAccess permissions. For more information, see Step 2: Create an IAM Administrator User and Group.


Install and configure the AWS CLI and the AWS SDKs. For more information, see Step 2: Set Up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs.


Use the following code to delete a model. 



[ AWS CLI ]
Change the value of project-version-arn to the name of the project you want to delete.
aws rekognition delete-project-version --project-version-arn model_arn

[ Python ]
Change the value of model_arn to the name of the model you want to delete.
