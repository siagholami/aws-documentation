Step 3: Prepare Your Dataset
You need a dataset to train a model. A dataset contains the labeled images that you prepared in Step 1: Prepare Your Images. You can create a dataset using the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console. Alternatively, you can use an Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth manifest format file and images.
