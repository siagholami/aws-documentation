Step 7: Train Your Model
To train the model, you use the dataset that you created in Step 3: Create a Dataset. You also need a dataset to test the model. In this step, you create a testing dataset by splitting the training dataset. You can also choose to create a new dataset or use an existing dataset for training. The original dataset remains unchanged. For more information, see Training an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Model.
A new version of a model is created every time the model is trained. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels creates a name for the model that is a combination of the project name and the timestamp for when the model is created. 
Note
You are charged for the amount of time that it takes to train a model. For more information, see Training hours.
