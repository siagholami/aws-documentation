Validation Rules
When you import a manifest file, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels applies validation rules for limits, syntax, and semantics. The Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth schema enforces syntax validation. For more information, see Output. The following are the validation rules for limits and semantics.
Note
The 20% invalidity rules apply cumulatively across all validation rules. If the import exceeds the 20% limit due to any combination, such as 15% invalid JSON and 15% invalid images, the import fails. 
Each dataset object is a line in the manifest. Blank/invalid lines are also counted as dataset objects.
Overlaps are (common labels between test and train)/(train labels).
