Step 4: Train Your Model
You train an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model by calling CreateProjectVersion. A new version of a model is created each time it is trained. CreateProjectVersion requires a training dataset and a testing dataset. In this step, you create a testing dataset by splitting your training dataset in an 80 (training)/20 (testing) split. When a model is trained, its performance is evaluated and the results placed in an S3 bucket. You can choose to place the training results in the same bucket as the console S3 bucket, or an S3 bucket that you choose. For more information, see Training a Model (SDK). 
In this step, you train a model using the dataset you prepared in Step 3: Prepare Your Dataset.
To train a model (SDK)

At the command prompt, enter the following command. Replace the following:
    my_project_arn with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project you created in Step 2: Create a Project.
    version_name with a unique version name of your choosing.
    output_bucket with the name of the Amazon S3 bucket where Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels saves the training results.
    output_folder with the name of the folder where the training results are saved.
    training_bucket with the name of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the manifest file and images.
    training_manifest with the name and path to the manifest file.

aws rekognition create-project-version\
      --project-arn "my_project_arn"\
     --version-name "version_name"\
     --output-config '{"S3Bucket":"output bucket", "S3KeyPrefix":"output_folder"}'\
     --training-data '{"Assets": [{ "GroundTruthManifest": { "S3Object": { "Bucket": "training_bucket", "Name": "training_manifest" } } } ] }'\
     --testing-data '{"AutoCreate":true }'


Note the value of version_name because you need it in the next step.


Use the following command to get the current status of the model training. Training is complete when the value of Status is TRAINING_COMPLETED. 


Replace project_arn with the ARN of the project you created in Step 2: Create a Project. Replace version_name with the name of the version that you used in Step 4: Train Your Model.
aws rekognition describe-project-versions --project-arn "project_arn"\
        --version-names "version_name"
