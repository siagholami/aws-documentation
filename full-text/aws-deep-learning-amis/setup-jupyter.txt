Set up a Jupyter Notebook Server
Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to manage notebook documents using a web browser. 
To set up a Jupyter notebook, you:
 Configure the Jupyter notebook server on your Amazon EC2 instance.
 Configure your client so that you can connect to the Jupyter notebook server. We provide configuration instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux clients.
 Test the setup by logging in to the Jupyter notebook server.
