Activating TensorFlow
This tutorial shows how to activate TensorFlow on an instance running the Deep Learning AMI with Conda (DLAMI on Conda) and run a TensorFlow program.
When a stable Conda package of a framework is released, it's tested and pre-installed on the DLAMI. If you want to run the latest, untested nightly build, you can Install TensorFlow's Nightly Build (experimental) manually. 
To run TensorFlow on the DLAMI with Conda


To activate TensorFlow, open an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance of the DLAMI with Conda.
    For TensorFlow and Keras 2 on Python 3 with CUDA 9.0 and MKL-DNN, run this command:
$ source activate tensorflow_p36
    For TensorFlow and Keras 2 on Python 2 with CUDA 9.0 and MKL-DNN, run this command:
$ source activate tensorflow_p27


Start the iPython terminal:


(tensorflow_p36)$ ipython

Run a TensorFlow program to verify that it is working properly:

import tensorflow as tf
   hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
   sess = tf.Session()
   print(sess.run(hello))
Hello, TensorFlow! should appear on your screen.
Install TensorFlow's Nightly Build (experimental)
You can install the latest TensorFlow build into either or both of the TensorFlow Conda environments on your Deep Learning AMI with Conda.
To install TensorFlow from a nightly build



For the Python 3 TensorFlow environment, run the following command:

$ source activate tensorflow_p36
    For the Python 2 TensorFlow environment, run the following command:
$ source activate tensorflow_p27


Remove the currently installed TensorFlow.
Note
The remaining steps assume you are using the tensorflow_p36 environment.


(tensorflow_p36)$ pip uninstall tensorflow

Install the latest nightly build of TensorFlow.

(tensorflow_p36)$ pip install tf-nightly

To verify you have successfully installed latest nightly build, start the IPython terminal and check the version of TensorFlow.

(tensorflow_p36)$ ipython
import tensorflow
   print (tensorflow.__version__)
The output should print something similar to 1.12.0-dev20181012
