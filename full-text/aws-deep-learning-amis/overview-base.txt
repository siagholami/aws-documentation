Deep Learning Base AMI
Deep Learning Base AMI is like an empty canvas for deep learning. It comes with everything you need up until the point of the installation of a particular framework. It will have your choice of CUDA versions. 
Why Choose the Base DLAMI
This AMI group is useful for project contributors who want to fork a deep learning project and build the latest. It's for someone who wants to roll their own environment with the confidence that the latest NVIDIA software is installed and working so they can focus on picking which frameworks and versions they want to install.
