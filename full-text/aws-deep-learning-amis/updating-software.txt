Tips for Software Updates
From time to time, you may want to manually update software on your DLAMI. It is generally recommended that you use pip to update Python packages. You should also use pip to update packages within a Conda environment on the Deep Learning AMI with Conda. Refer to the particular framework's or software's website for upgrading and installation instructions. 
If you are interested in running the latest master branch of a particular package, activate the appropriate environment, then add --pre to the end of the pip install --upgrade command. For example: 
source activate mxnet_p36
pip install --upgrade mxnet --pre
