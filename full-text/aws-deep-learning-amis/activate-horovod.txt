TensorFlow with Horovod
This tutorial shows how to activate TensorFlow with Horovod on an AWS Deep Learning AMI (DLAMI) with Conda. Horovod is pre-installed in the Conda environments for TensorFlow. The Python3 environment is recommended. 
Note
Only P3.*, P2.*, and G3.* instance types are supported.
To activate TensorFlow and test Horovod on the DLAMI with Conda


Open an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance of the DLAMI with Conda. For help getting started with a DLAMI, see How to Get Started with the DLAMI.
    (Recommended) For TensorFlow with Horovod on Python 3 with CUDA 9, run this command:
$ source activate tensorflow_p36
    For TensorFlow with Horovod on Python 2 with CUDA 9, run this command:
$ source activate tensorflow_p27


Start the iPython terminal:


(tensorflow_p36)$ ipython

Test importing TensorFlow with Horovod to verify that it's working properly:

import horovod.tensorflow as hvd
   hvd.init()
The following may appear on your screen (you may ignore any warning messages).

Another transport will be used instead, although this may result in
   lower performance.
