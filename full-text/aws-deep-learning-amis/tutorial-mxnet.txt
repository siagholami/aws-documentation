Apache MXNet
Activating MXNet
This tutorial shows how to activate MXNet on an instance running the Deep Learning AMI with Conda (DLAMI on Conda) and run a MXNet program.
When a stable Conda package of a framework is released, it's tested and pre-installed on the DLAMI. If you want to run the latest, untested nightly build, you can Installing MXNet's Nightly Build (experimental) manually. 
To run MXNet on the DLAMI with Conda


To activate the framework, open an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance of the DLAMI with Conda.
    For MXNet and Keras 2 on Python 3 with CUDA 9.0 and MKL-DNN, run this command:
$ source activate mxnet_p36
    For MXNet and Keras 2 on Python 2 with CUDA 9.0 and MKL-DNN, run this command:
$ source activate mxnet_p27


Start the iPython terminal.


(mxnet_p36)$ ipython

Run a quick MXNet program. Create a 5x5 matrix, an instance of the NDArray, with elements initialized to 0. Print the array.

import mxnet as mx
   mx.ndarray.zeros((5,5)).asnumpy()

Verify the result.

array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
          [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
          [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
          [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
          [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]], dtype=float32)
Installing MXNet's Nightly Build (experimental)
You can install the latest MXNet build into either or both of the MXNet Conda environments on your Deep Learning AMI with Conda.
To install MXNet from a nightly build



For the Python 3 MXNet environment, run this command:

$ source activate mxnet_p36
    For the Python 2 MXNet environment, run this command:
$ source activate mxnet_p27


Remove the currently installed MXNet.
Note
The remaining steps assume you are using the mxnet_p36 environment.


(mxnet_p36)$ pip uninstall mxnet-cu90mkl

Install the latest nightly build of MXNet.

(mxnet_p36)$ pip install --pre mxnet-cu90mkl

To verify you have successfully installed latest nightly build, start the IPython terminal and check the version of MXNet.

(mxnet_p36)$ ipython
import mxnet
   print (mxnet.__version__)
The output should print the latest stable version of MXNet.
