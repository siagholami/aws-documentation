AWS tools related to the AWS SDK for .NET
Tools for Windows PowerShell and Tools for PowerShell Core
The AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell and AWS Tools for PowerShell Core are PowerShell modules that are built on the functionality exposed by the AWS SDK for .NET. The AWS PowerShell Tools enable you to script operations on your AWS resources from the PowerShell prompt. Although the cmdlets are implemented using the service clients and methods from the SDK, the cmdlets provide an idiomatic PowerShell experience for specifying parameters and handling results.
To get started, see AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell.
Toolkit for VS Code
The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code is a plugin for the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor. The toolkit makes it easier for you to develop, debug, and deploy applications that use AWS. 
With the toolkit, you can do such things as the following:
 Create serverless applications that contain AWS Lambda functions, and then deploy the applications to an AWS CloudFormation stack.
 Work with Amazon EventBridge schemas.
 Use IntelliSense when working with Amazon ECS task-definition files.
 Visualize an AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) application.
Toolkit for Visual Studio
The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio is a plugin for the Visual Studio IDE that makes it easier for you to develop, debug, and deploy .NET applications that use Amazon Web Services. The Toolkit for Visual Studio provides Visual Studio templates for services such as Lambda and deployment wizards for web applications and serverless applications. You can use the AWS Explorer to manage Amazon EC2 instances, work with Amazon DynamoDB tables, publish messages to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) queues, and more, all within Visual Studio.
To get started, see Setting up the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio.
Toolkit for Azure DevOps
The AWS Toolkit for Microsoft Azure DevOps adds tasks to easily enable build and release pipelines in Azure DevOps and Azure DevOps Server to work with AWS services. You can work with Amazon S3, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CodeDeploy, Lambda, AWS CloudFormation, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), and Amazon SNS. You can also run commands using the Windows PowerShell module and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
