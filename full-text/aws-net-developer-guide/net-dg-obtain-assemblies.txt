Obtaining assemblies for the AWS SDK for .NET
This topic describes how you can obtain the AWSSDK assemblies and store them locally (or on premises) for use in your projects. This is not the recommended method for handling SDK references, but is required in some environments.
Note
The recommended method for handling SDK references is to download and install just the NuGet packages that each project needs. That method is described in Install AWSSDK packages with NuGet.
If you can't or aren't allowed to download and install NuGet packages on a per-project basis, the following options are available to you.
Download and extract ZIP files
(Remember that this isn't the recommended method for handling references to the AWS SDK for .NET.)


Download the following ZIP file: aws-sdk-netstandard2.0.zip
Note
If you require AWSSDK assemblies for .NET Framework instead of .NET Core, see Download and extract ZIP files in the version 3 developer guide.


Extract the assemblies to some "download" folder on your file system; it doesn't matter where. Make note of this folder.


When you set up your project, you get the required assemblies from this folder, as described in Install AWSSDK assemblies without NuGet.


Install the MSI on Windows
(Remember that this isn't the recommended method for handling references to the AWS SDK for .NET.)
If you are required to install an MSI instead of using NuGet or one of the methods described earlier, you can find the legacy MSI at https://sdk-for-net.amazonwebservices.com/latest/AWSToolsAndSDKForNet.msi.
By default, the AWS SDK for .NET is installed in the Program Files folder, which requires administrator privileges. To install the SDK as a non-administrator, choose a different folder.
