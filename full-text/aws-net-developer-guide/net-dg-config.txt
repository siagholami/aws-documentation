Setting up your AWS SDK for .NET project
In addition to setting up your environment, you need to configure each project that you create.
Note
The configuration shown here is centered around .NET Core and ASP.NET Core (although there might be some overlap with .NET Framework configuration).
If you're looking for .NET Framework configuration, see version 3 of the guide instead.
There are a few essential things your application needs to access AWS services through the AWS SDK for .NET:
 An appropriate user account or role
 Credentials for that user account or to assume that role
 Specification of the AWS Region
 AWSSDK packages or assemblies
Some of the topics in this section provide information about how to configure these essential things.
Other topics in this section and other sections provide information about more advanced ways that you can configure your project.
