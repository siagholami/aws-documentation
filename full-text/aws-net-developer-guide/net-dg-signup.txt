Create an AWS account
To use the AWS SDK for .NET to access AWS services, you need an AWS account and AWS credentials.

Create an account.

To create an AWS account, see How do I create and activate a new Amazon Web Services account?

Create an administrative user.

Avoid using your root user account (the initial account you create) to access the management console and services. Instead, create an administrative user account, as explained in Creating your first IAM admin user and group.
After you create the administrative user account and record the login details, sign out of your root user account and sign back in using the administrative account.
If you need to close your AWS account, see Closing an account.
