Exploring activity details on a profile panel
After making an initial assessment that a finding might be a true positive, the next step is to dig deeper into the pattern of activity for the related resources.
On the following profile panels, you can display a summary of the activity details.
 Overall API call volume, except for the profile panels on the IP address profile and the user agent profile
 Newly observed geolocations, except for the profile panel on the federated user profile
 Overall VPC flow volume
The activity details can answer these types of questions:
 Which IP addresses were used?
 Where were those IP addresses located?
 Which API calls did each IP address make?
 Which access key identifiers (AKIDs) were used to make the calls?
 What resources were used to make those calls?
 How many calls were made? How many succeeded and failed?
 What volume of VPC flow data was sent to or from each IP address?
