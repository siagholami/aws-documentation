Supported actions
AWS IoT Events can trigger actions when it detects a specified event or transition event. You can define built-in actions to use a timer or set a variable, or send data to other AWS resources.
Note
When you define an action in a detector model, you can use expressions for parameters that are string data type. For more information, see Expressions.
