Using the AWS Serverless Application Repository to Deploy a Data Source Connector
You can also use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy an Athena data source connector. You find the connector that you want to use, provide the parameters that the connector requires, and then deploy the connector to your account.
Note
To use this feature in preview, you must create an Athena workgroup named AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality and join that workgroup. For more information, see Managing Workgroups.
To use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy a data source connector to your account


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Serverless App Repository.


In the navigation pane, choose Available applications.


Select the option Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies.


In the search box, type the name of the connector, or search for applications published with the author name Amazon Athena Federation. This author name is reserved for applications that the Amazon Athena team has written, tested, and validated. For a list of prebuilt Athena data connectors, see Using Athena Data Source Connectors.


Choose the name of the connector. This opens the Lambda function's Application details page in the AWS Lambda console.


On the right side of the details page, for Application settings, SpillBucket, specify an Amazon S3 bucket to receive data from large response payloads. For information about the remaining configurable options, see the corresponding Available Connectors topic on GitHub.
