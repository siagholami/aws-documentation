What is a Geospatial Query?
Geospatial queries are specialized types of SQL queries supported in Athena. They differ from non-spatial SQL queries in the following ways:
 Using the following specialized geometry data types: point, line, multiline, polygon, and multipolygon.
 Expressing relationships between geometry data types, such as distance, equals, crosses, touches, overlaps, disjoint, and others.
Using geospatial queries in Athena, you can run these and other similar operations:
 Find the distance between two points.
 Check whether one area (polygon) contains another.
 Check whether one line crosses or touches another line or polygon.
For example, to obtain a point geometry data type from values of type double for the geographic coordinates of Mount Rainier in Athena, use the ST_POINT (longitude, latitude) geospatial function, as in the following example. 
ST_POINT(-121.7602, 46.8527)
