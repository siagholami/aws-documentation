IAM Policies for Accessing Data Catalogs
To control access to data catalogs, use resource-level IAM permissions or identity-based IAM policies. 
The following procedure is specific to Athena. 
For IAM-specific information, see the links listed at the end of this section. For information about example JSON data catalog policies, see Data Catalog Example Policies.
To use the visual editor in the IAM console to create a data catalog policy


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. 


In the navigation pane on the left, choose Policies, and then choose Create policy.


On the Visual editor tab, choose Choose a service. Then choose Athena to add to the policy.


Choose Select actions, and then choose the actions to add to the policy. The visual editor shows the actions available in Athena. For more information, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Athena in the IAM User Guide.


Choose add actions to type a specific action or use wildcards (*) to specify multiple actions. 


By default, the policy that you are creating allows the actions that you choose. If you chose one or more actions that support resource-level permissions to the datacatalog resource in Athena, then the editor lists the datacatalog resource. 


Choose Resources to specify the specific data catalogs for your policy. For example JSON data catalog policies, see Data Catalog Example Policies.


Specify the datacatalog resource as follows:


arn:aws:athena:<region>:<user-account>:datacatalog/<datacatalog-name>


Choose Review policy, and then type a Name and a Description (optional) for the policy that you are creating. Review the policy summary to make sure that you granted the intended permissions. 


Choose Create policy to save your new policy.


Attach this identity-based policy to a user, a group, or role and specify the datacatalog resources they can access.
