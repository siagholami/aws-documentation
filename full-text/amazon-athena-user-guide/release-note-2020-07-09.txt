Amazon Athena adds support for querying compacted Hudi datasets and adds the AWS CloudFormation AWS::Athena::DataCatalog resource for creating, updating, or deleting data catalogs that you register in Athena.
Querying Apache Hudi Datasets
Apache Hudi is an open-source data management framework that simplifies incremental data processing. Amazon Athena now supports querying the read-optimized view of an Apache Hudi dataset in your Amazon S3-based data lake.
For more information, see Using Athena to Query Apache Hudi Datasets.
AWS CloudFormation Data Catalog Resource
To use Amazon Athena's federated query feature to query any data source, you must first register your data catalog in Athena. You can now use the AWS CloudFormation AWS::Athena::DataCatalog resource to create, update, or delete data catalogs that you register in Athena.
For more information, see AWS::Athena::DataCatalog in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
