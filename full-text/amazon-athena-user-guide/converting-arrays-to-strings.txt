Converting Arrays to Strings
To convert an array into a single string, use the array_join function.
WITH
dataset AS (
  SELECT ARRAY ['hello', 'amazon', 'athena'] AS words
)
SELECT array_join(words, ' ') AS welcome_msg
FROM dataset
This query returns:
---------------------
| welcome_msg         |
---------------------
| hello amazon athena |
---------------------
