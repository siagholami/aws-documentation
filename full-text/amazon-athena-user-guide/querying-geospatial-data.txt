Querying Geospatial Data
Geospatial data contains identifiers that specify a geographic position for an object. Examples of this type of data include weather reports, map directions, tweets with geographic positions, store locations, and airline routes. Geospatial data plays an important role in business analytics, reporting, and forecasting.
Geospatial identifiers, such as latitude and longitude, allow you to convert any mailing address into a set of geographic coordinates.
