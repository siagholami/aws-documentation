Added support for Amazon S3 data encryption and released JDBC driver update (version 1.0.1) with encryption support, improvements, and bug fixes.
Features

Added the following encryption features:
Support for querying encrypted data in Amazon S3. 
Support for encrypting Athena query results. 
A new version of the driver supports new encryption features, adds improvements, and fixes issues.
Added the ability to add, replace, and change columns using ALTER TABLE. For more information, see Alter Column in the Hive documentation.
Added support for querying LZO-compressed data.

For more information, see Encryption at Rest.
Improvements

Better JDBC query performance with page-size improvements, returning 1,000 rows instead of 100.
Added ability to cancel a query using the JDBC driver interface.
Added ability to specify JDBC options in the JDBC connection URL. For more information, see Using Athena with the Previous Version of the JDBC Driver for the previous version of the driver, and Connect with the JDBC, for the most current version.
Added PROXY setting in the driver, which can now be set using ClientConfiguration in the AWS SDK for Java.

Bug Fixes
Fixed the following bugs:
 Throttling errors would occur when multiple queries were issued using the JDBC driver interface.
 The JDBC driver would stop when projecting a decimal data type.
  The JDBC driver would return every data type as a string, regardless of how the data type was defined in the table. For example, selecting a column defined as an INT data type using resultSet.GetObject() would return a STRING data type instead of INT. 
 The JDBC driver would verify credentials at the time a connection was made, rather than at the time a query would run.
 Queries made through the JDBC driver would fail when a schema was specified along with the URL.
