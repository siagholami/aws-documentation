Concatenating Strings and Arrays
Concatenating Strings
To concatenate two strings, you can use the double pipe || operator, as in the following example.
SELECT 'This' || ' is' || ' a' || ' test.' AS Concatenated_String
This query returns:
Concatenated_String
This is a test.
You can use the concat() function to achieve the same result.
SELECT concat('This', ' is', ' a', ' test.') AS Concatenated_String
This query returns:
Concatenated_String
This is a test.
Concatenating Arrays
You can use the same techniques to concatenate arrays.
To concatenate multiple arrays, use the double pipe || operator.
SELECT ARRAY [4,5] || ARRAY[ ARRAY[1,2], ARRAY[3,4] ] AS items
This query returns:
items
[[4, 5], [1, 2], [3, 4]]
To combine multiple arrays into a single array, use the double pipe operator or the concat() function.
WITH
dataset AS (
  SELECT
    ARRAY ['Hello', 'Amazon', 'Athena'] AS words,
    ARRAY ['Hi', 'Alexa'] AS alexa
)
SELECT concat(words, alexa) AS welcome_msg
FROM dataset
This query returns:
welcome_msg
[Hello, Amazon, Athena, Hi, Alexa]
