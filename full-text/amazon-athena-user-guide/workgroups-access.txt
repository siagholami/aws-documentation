Access to Workgroups and Tags
A workgroup is a resource managed by Athena. Therefore, if your workgroup policy uses actions that take workgroup as an input, you must specify the workgroup's ARN as follows, where workgroup-name is the name of your workgroup:
"Resource": [arn:aws:athena:region:AWSAcctID:workgroup/workgroup-name]
For example, for a workgroup named test_workgroup in the us-west-2 region for AWS account 123456789012, specify the workgroup as a resource using the following ARN:
"Resource":["arn:aws:athena:us-east-2:123456789012:workgroup/test_workgroup"]
