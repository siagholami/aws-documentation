Amazon Athena now publishes Amazon CloudWatch Events for query state transitions. When a query transitions between states -- for example, from Running to a terminal state such as Succeeded or Cancelled -- Athena publishes a query state change event to CloudWatch Events. The event contains information about the query state transition. For more information, see Monitoring Athena Queries with CloudWatch Events.
