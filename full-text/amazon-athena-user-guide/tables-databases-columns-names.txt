Names for Tables, Databases, and Columns
Use these tips for naming items in Athena.
Table names and table column names in Athena must be lowercase
If you are interacting with Apache Spark, then your table names and table column names must be lowercase. Athena is case-insensitive and turns table names and column names to lower case, but Spark requires lowercase table and column names.
Queries with mixedCase column names, such as profileURI, or upper case column names do not work.
Special characters
Special characters other than underscore (_) are not supported. For more information, see the Apache Hive LanguageManual DDL documentation.
Important
Although you may succeed in creating table, view, database, or column names that contain special characters other than underscore by enclosing them in backtick (`) characters, subsequent DDL or DML queries that reference them can fail.
Names that begin with an underscore
When creating tables, use backticks to enclose table, view, or column names that begin with an underscore. For example:
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `_myunderscoretable`(
  `_id` string, `_index` string)
LOCATION 's3://my-athena-data/'
Table, view, or column names that begin with numbers
When running SELECT, CTAS, or VIEW queries, put quotation marks around identifiers like table, view, or column names that start with a digit. For example:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW "123view" AS
SELECT "123columnone", "123columntwo"
FROM "234table"
Reserved words
Certain reserved words in Athena must be escaped. To escape reserved keywords in DDL statements, enclose them in backticks (\)\. To escape reserved keywords in SQLSELECT` statements and in queries on views, enclose them in double quotes ('').
