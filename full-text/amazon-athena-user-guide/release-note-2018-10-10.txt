Athena supports CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, which creates a table from the result of a SELECT query statement. For details, see Creating a Table from Query Results (CTAS).
Before you create CTAS queries, it is important to learn about their behavior in the Athena documentation. It contains information about the location for saving query results in Amazon S3, the list of supported formats for storing CTAS query results, the number of partitions you can create, and supported compression formats. For more information, see Considerations and Limitations for CTAS Queries.
Use CTAS queries to:
 Create a table from query results in one step.
 Create CTAS queries in the Athena console, using Examples. For information about syntax, see CREATE TABLE AS.
  Transform query results into other storage formats, such as PARQUET, ORC, AVRO, JSON, and TEXTFILE. For more information, see Considerations and Limitations for CTAS Queries and Columnar Storage Formats.
