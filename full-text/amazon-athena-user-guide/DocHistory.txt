Released the new version of the ODBC driver with support for Athena workgroups.
To download the ODBC driver version 1.0.5 and its documentation, see Connecting to Amazon Athena with ODBC. There are no changes to the ODBC driver connection string when you use tags on workgroups. To use tags, upgrade to the latest version of the ODBC driver, which is this current version. This driver version lets you use Athena API workgroup actions to create and manage workgroups, and Athena API tag actions to add, list, or remove tags on workgroups. Before you begin, make sure that you have resource-level permissions in IAM for actions on workgroups and tags.
March 5, 2019


Added tag support for workgroups in Amazon Athena.
A tag consists of a key and a value, both of which you define. When you tag a workgroup, you assign custom metadata to it. For example, create a workgroup for each cost center. Then, by adding tags to these workgroups, you can track your Athena spending for each cost center. For more information, see Using Tags for Billing in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.

Improved the JSON OpenX SerDe used in Athena.
The improvements include, but are not limited to, the following: [See the AWS documentation website for more details] For more information, see OpenX JSON SerDe.
February 18, 2019


Added support for workgroups.
Use workgroups to separate users, teams, applications, or workloads, and to set limits on amount of data each query or the entire workgroup can process. Because workgroups act as IAM resources, you can use resource-level permissions to control access to a specific workgroup. You can also view query-related metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, control query costs by configuring limits on the amount of data scanned, create thresholds, and trigger actions, such as Amazon SNS alarms, when these thresholds are breached. For more information, see Using Workgroups for Running Queries and Controlling Costs and Monitoring Queries with CloudWatch Metrics and Events.
February 18, 2019


Added support for analyzing logs from Network Load Balancer.
Added example Athena queries for analyzing logs from Network Load Balancer. These logs receive detailed information about the Transport Layer Security (TLS) requests sent to the Network Load Balancer. You can use these access logs to analyze traffic patterns and troubleshoot issues. For information, see Querying Network Load Balancer Logs.

Access is established through the versions of JDBC or ODBC drivers that support SAML 2.0. For information about configuring federated access to the Athena API, see Enabling Federated Access to the Athena API.
