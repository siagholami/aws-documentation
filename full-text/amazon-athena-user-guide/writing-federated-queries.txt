Writing Federated Queries
After you have configured one or more data connectors and deployed them to your account, you can use them in your Athena queries. 
Querying a Single Data Source
The examples in this section assume that you have configured and deployed the Athena CloudWatch connector to your account. Use the same approach to query when you use other connectors.
To create an Athena query that uses the CloudWatch connector


Open the Athena console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/.


In the Athena Query Editor, create a SQL query that uses the following syntax in the FROM clause.


MyCloudwatchCatalog.database_name.table_name
Examples
The following example uses the Athena CloudWatch connector to connect to the all_log_streams view in the /var/ecommerce-engine/order-processor CloudWatch Logs Log Group. The all_log_streams view is a view of all the log streams in the log group. The example query limits the number of rows returned to 100.
Example 
SELECT * FROM "MyCloudwatchCatalog"."/var/ecommerce-engine/order-processor".all_log_streams limit 100;
The following example parses information from the same view as the previous example. The example extracts the order ID and log level and filters out any message that has the level INFO.
Example 
SELECT log_stream as ec2_instance,
                        Regexp_extract(message '.*orderId=(\d) .*', 1) AS orderId,
                        message                                         AS
                        order_processor_log,
                        Regexp_extract(message, '(.*):.*', 1)           AS log_level
            FROM
                    "MyCloudwatchCatalog"."/var/ecommerce-engine/order-processor".all_log_streams
            WHERE Regexp_extract(message, '(.*):.*', 1) != 'INFO'
The following image shows a sample result.
Note
This example shows a query where the data source has been registered as a catalog with Athena. You can also reference a data source connector Lambda function using the format lambda:MyLambdaFunctionName.

Querying Multiple Data Sources
As a more complex example, imagine an ecommerce company that has an application infrastructure such as the one shown in the following diagram.

The following descriptions explain the numbered items in the diagram.


Payment processing in a secure VPC with transaction records stored in HBase on Amazon EMR


Redis to store active orders so that the processing engine can access them quickly


Amazon DocumentDB for customer account data such as email addresses and shipping addresses


A product catalog in Amazon Aurora for an ecommerce site that uses automatic scaling on Fargate


CloudWatch Logs to house the order processor's log events


A write-once-read-many data warehouse on Amazon RDS


DynamoDB to store shipment tracking data


Imagine that a data analyst for this ecommerce application discovers that the state of some orders is being reported erroneously. Some orders show as pending even though they were delivered, while others show as delivered but haven't shipped.
The analyst wants to know how many orders are being delayed and what the affected orders have in common across the ecommerce infrastructure. Instead of investigating the sources of information separately, the analyst federates the data sources and retrieves the necessary information in a single query. Extracting the data into a single location is not necessary.
The analyst's query uses the following Athena data connectors:
 CloudWatch Logs – Retrieves logs from the order processing service and uses regex matching and extraction to filter for orders with WARN or ERROR events.
 Redis – Retrieves the active orders from the Redis instance.
 CMDB – Retrieves the ID and state of the Amazon EC2 instance that ran the order processing service and logged the WARN or ERROR message.
 DocumentDB – Retrieves the customer email and address from Amazon DocumentDB for the affected orders.
 DynamoDB – Retrieves the shipping status and tracking details from the shipping table to identify possible discrepancies between reported and actual status.
 HBase – Retrieves the payment status for the affected orders from the payment processing service.
Example
This example shows a query where the data source has been registered as a catalog with Athena. You can also reference a data source connector Lambda function using the format lambda:MyLambdaFunctionName.
```
