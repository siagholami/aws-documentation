DROP DATABASE
Removes the named database from the catalog. If the database contains tables, you must either drop the tables before running DROP DATABASE or use the CASCADE clause. The use of DATABASE and SCHEMA are interchangeable. They mean the same thing.
Synopsis
DROP {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [IF EXISTS] database_name [RESTRICT | CASCADE]
Parameters
[IF EXISTS]
Causes the error to be suppressed if database_name doesn't exist.
[RESTRICT|CASCADE]
Determines how tables within database_name are regarded during the DROP operation. If you specify RESTRICT, the database is not dropped if it contains tables. This is the default behavior. Specifying CASCADE causes the database and all its tables to be dropped.
Examples
DROP DATABASE clickstreams;
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS clickstreams CASCADE;
