Using Athena with the JDBC Driver
You can use a JDBC connection to connect Athena to business intelligence tools and other applications, such as SQL Workbench. To do this, download, install, and configure the Athena JDBC driver, using the following links on Amazon S3.
Links for Downloading the JDBC Driver
The JDBC driver version 2.0.13 complies with the JDBC API 4.1 and 4.2 data standards. Before downloading the driver, check which version of Java Runtime Environment (JRE) you use. The JRE version depends on the version of the JDBC API you are using with the driver. If you are not sure, download the latest version of the driver. 
Download the driver that matches your version of the JDK and the JDBC data standards:
 The AthenaJDBC41-2.0.13.jar is compatible with JDBC 4.1 and requires JDK 7.0 or later.
 The AthenaJDBC42-2.0.13.jar is compatible with JDBC 4.2 and requires JDK 8.0 or later.

Migration from Previous Version of the JDBC Driver
The current JDBC driver version 2.0.13 is a drop-in replacement of the previous version of the JDBC driver version 2.0.9, and is backwards compatible with the JDBC driver version 2.0.9, with the following step that you must perform to ensure the driver runs. 
Important
To use JDBC driver version 2.0.5 or later, attach a permissions policy to IAM principals using the JDBC driver that allows the athena:GetQueryResultsStream policy action. This policy action is not exposed directly with the API. It is only used with the JDBC driver as part of streaming results support. For an example policy, see AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess Managed Policy. 
Additionally, ensure that port 444, which Athena uses to stream query results, is open to outbound traffic. When you use a PrivateLink endpoint to connect to Athena, ensure that the security group attached to the PrivateLink endpoint is open to inbound traffic on port 444. If port 444 is blocked, you may receive the error message [Simba][AthenaJDBC](100123) An error has occurred. Exception during column initialization. 
For more information about upgrading to versions 2.0.5 or later from version 2.0.2, see the JDBC Driver Migration Guide. 
For more information about the previous versions of the JDBC driver, see Using the Previous Version of the JDBC Driver.
If you are migrating from a 1.x driver to a 2.x driver, you must migrate your existing configurations to the new configuration. We highly recommend that you migrate to driver version 2.x. For information, see the JDBC Driver Migration Guide.
