Integration with AWS Glue
AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (extract, transform, and load) service that can categorize your data, clean it, enrich it, and move it reliably between various data stores. AWS Glue crawlers automatically infer database and table schema from your dataset, storing the associated metadata in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
Athena natively supports querying datasets and data sources that are registered with the AWS Glue Data Catalog. When you run Data Manipulation Language (DML) queries in Athena with the Data Catalog as your source, you are using the Data Catalog schema to derive insight from the underlying dataset. When you run Data Definition Language (DDL) queries, the schema you define are defined in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. From within Athena, you can also run a AWS Glue crawler on a data source to create schema in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

In regions where AWS Glue is supported, Athena uses the AWS Glue Data Catalog as a central location to store and retrieve table metadata throughout an AWS account. The Athena query engine requires table metadata that instructs it where to read data, how to read it, and other information necessary to process the data. The AWS Glue Data Catalog provides a unified metadata repository across a variety of data sources and data formats, integrating not only with Athena, but with Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Redshift Spectrum, Amazon EMR, and any application compatible with the Apache Hive metastore.
