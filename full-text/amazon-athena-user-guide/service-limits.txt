Service Quotas
Note
The Service Quotas console provides information about Amazon Athena quotas. Along with viewing the default quotas, you can use the Service Quotas console to request quota increases for the quotas that are adjustable.
Queries
Your account has the following default query-related quotas per AWS Region for Amazon Athena: 
 DDL query quota – 20 DDL active queries. DDL queries include CREATE TABLE and CREATE TABLE ADD PARTITION queries. 
 DDL query timeout – The DDL query timeout is 600 minutes.
 DML query quota – 20 DML active queries. DML queries include SELECT and CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) queries.
 DML query timeout – The DML query timeout is 30 minutes.
These are soft quotas; you can use the Athena Service Quotas console to request a quota increase.
Note
Athena processes queries by assigning resources based on the overall service load and the number of incoming requests. Your queries may be temporarily queued before they run. Asynchronous processes pick up the queries from queues and run them on physical resources as soon as the resources become available and for as long as your account configuration permits.
Query String Length
The maximum allowed query string length is 262144 bytes, where the strings are encoded in UTF-8. This is not an adjustable quota. Use these tips for naming columns, tables, and databases in Athena. 
Note
If you require a greater query string length, provide feedback at athena-feedback@amazon.com with the details of your use case, or contact AWS Support.
Workgroups
When you work with Athena workgroups, remember the following points:
 Athena service quotas are shared across all workgroups in an account.
 The maximum number of workgroups you can create per Region in an account is 1000.
 The maximum number of tags per workgroup is 50. For more information, see Tag Restrictions. 
AWS Glue

If you are using the AWS Glue Data Catalog with Athena, see AWS Glue Endpoints and Quotas for service quotas on tables, databases, and partitions. 
If you are not using AWS Glue Data Catalog, the number of partitions per table is 20,000. You can request a quota increase.

Note
If you have not yet migrated to AWS Glue Data Catalog, see Upgrading to the AWS Glue Data Catalog Step-by-Step for migration instructions.
Amazon S3 Buckets
When you work with Amazon S3 buckets, remember the following points:
 Amazon S3 has a default service quota of 100 buckets per account.
 Athena requires a separate bucket to log results.
 You can request a quota increase of up to 1,000 Amazon S3 buckets per AWS account. 
Per Account API Call Quotas
Athena APIs have the following default quotas for the number of calls to the API per account (not per query):



API Name
Default Number of Calls per Second
Burst Capacity




BatchGetNamedQuery, ListNamedQueries, ListQueryExecutions
5
up to 10


CreateNamedQuery, DeleteNamedQuery, GetNamedQuery
5
up to 20


BatchGetQueryExecution
20
up to 40


StartQueryExecution, StopQueryExecution
20
up to 80


GetQueryExecution, GetQueryResults
100
up to 200



For example, for StartQueryExecution, you can make up to 20 calls per second. In addition, if this API is not called for 4 seconds, your account accumulates a burst capacity of up to 80 calls. In this case, your application can make up to 80 calls to this API in burst mode.
If you use any of these APIs and exceed the default quota for the number of calls per second, or the burst capacity in your account, the Athena API issues an error similar to the following: ""ClientError: An error occurred (ThrottlingException) when calling the  operation: Rate exceeded." Reduce the number of calls per second, or the burst capacity for the API for this account. To request a quota increase, contact AWS Support. Open the AWS Support Center page, sign in if necessary, and choose Create case. Choose Service limit increase. Complete and submit the form.
Note
This quota cannot be changed in the Athena Service Quotas console.
