Identity and Access Management in Athena
Amazon Athena uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access to Athena operations.
To run queries in Athena, you must have the appropriate permissions for the following:
 Athena API actions including additional actions for Athena workgroups.
 Amazon S3 locations where the underlying data to query is stored. 
 Metadata and resources that you store in the AWS Glue Data Catalog, such as databases and tables, including additional actions for encrypted metadata. 
If you are an administrator for other users, make sure that they have appropriate permissions associated with their user profiles. In addition to the following topics, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon Athena in the IAM User Guide.
