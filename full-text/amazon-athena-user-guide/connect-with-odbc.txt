Migration from the Previous Version of the ODBC Driver
The current ODBC driver version 1.1.2 is a drop-in replacement of the previous version of the ODBC driver version 1.0.5. It is also backward compatible with the ODBC driver version 1.0.3, if you use the following required steps to make sure that the driver runs. 
Important
To use the ODBC driver versions 1.0.3 and greater, follow these requirements: 
Keep port 444, which Athena uses to stream query results, open to outbound traffic. When you use a PrivateLink endpoint to connect to Athena, ensure that the security group attached to the PrivateLink endpoint is open to inbound traffic on port 444. 
Add the athena:GetQueryResultsStream policy action to the list of policies for Athena. This policy action is not exposed directly with the API operation, and is used only with the ODBC and JDBC drivers, as part of streaming results support. For an example policy, see AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess Managed Policy.
