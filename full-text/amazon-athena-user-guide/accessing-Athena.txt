Accessing Amazon Athena
You can access Amazon Athena using the AWS Management Console, the Amazon Athena API, or the AWS CLI.
Using the Console
You can use the AWS Management Console for Amazon Athena to do the following:
 Create or select a database. 
 Create, view, and delete tables. 
 Filter tables by starting to type their names.
 Preview tables and generate CREATE TABLE DDL for them.
 Show table properties.
 Run queries on tables, save and format queries, and view query history.
 Create up to ten queries using different query tabs in the query editor. To open a new tab, click the plus sign.
 Display query results, save, and export them.
 Access the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
 View and change settings, such as view the query result location, configure auto-complete, and encrypt query results.
In the right pane, the Query Editor displays an introductory screen that prompts you to create your first table. You can view your tables under Tables in the left pane.
Here's a high-level overview of the actions available for each table:
 Preview tables – View the query syntax in the Query Editor on the right. 
 Show properties – Show a table's name, its location in Amazon S3, input and output formats, the serialization (SerDe) library used, and whether the table has encrypted data.
 Delete table – Delete a table.
 Generate CREATE TABLE DDL – Generate the query behind a table and view it in the query editor.
