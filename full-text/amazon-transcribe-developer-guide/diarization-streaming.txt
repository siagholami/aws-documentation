Identifying Speakers in Real-time Streams
You can identify different speakers in either HTTP/2 or Websocket streams. Speaker identification works best for identifying between two and five speakers. Although Amazon Transcribe can identify more than five speakers in a stream, the accuracy of speaker identification decreases if you exceed that number. To start an HTTP/2 stream, you specify the ShowSpeakerLabel request parameter of the StartStreamTranscription operation. To start a Websocket request, you use a pre-signed URL, a URL that contains the information needed to start your stream. To use the console to transcribe speech spoken into your microphone, use the following procedure.
To identify speakers in audio that is spoken into your microphone (console)
You can use the Amazon Transcribe console to start a real-time stream and transcribe any speech picked up by your microphone.


Sign into the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Transcribe console at Amazon Transcribe console.


In the navigation pane, choose Real-time transcription.


In Language, choose the language of your real-time stream.


Under Additional settings, enable Speaker identification.


Choose Start streaming.


Speak into the microphone.


HTTP/2 Streaming
The following is the syntax for the parameters of an HTTP/2 request.
```
    POST /stream-transcription HTTP/2
    x-amzn-transcribe-language-code: LanguageCode
    x-amzn-transcribe-sample-rate: MediaSampleRateHertz
    x-amzn-transcribe-media-encoding: MediaEncoding
    x-amzn-transcribe-session-id: SessionId
    x-amzn-transcribe-vocabulary-filter-name: VocabularyFilterName
    x-amzn-transcribe-vocabulary-filter-method: VocabularyFilterMethod
    x-amzn-transcribe-show-speaker-label: ShowSpeakerLabel
    Content-type: application/json
{
   "AudioStream": { 
      "AudioEvent": { 
         "AudioChunk": blob
      }
   }
}

```
To identify speakers in an HTTP/2 stream, use the StartStreamTranscription and specify the following:
 For LanguageCode, specify the language code that corresponds to the language spoken in your audio file.
 For MediaSampleHertz, specify the sample rate of the audio.
 ShowSpeakerLabel â€“ true.
Websocket Streaming
To identify speakers in Websocket streams, use the following format to create a pre-signed URL to start a Websocket request and specify show-speaker-label as true. A pre-signed URL contains the information to set up bi-directional communication between your application and Amazon Transcribe.
GET wss://transcribestreaming.region.amazonaws.com:8443/stream-transcription-websocket
?language-code=languageCode
    &X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
    &X-Amz-Credential=Signature Version 4 credential scope
    &X-Amz-Date=date
    &X-Amz-Expires=time in seconds until expiration
    &X-Amz-Security-Token=security-token
    &X-Amz-Signature=Signature Version 4 signature
    &X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host
    &media-encoding=mediaEncoding
    &sample-rate=mediaSampleRateHertz
    &session-id=sessionId
    &show-speaker-label=true
