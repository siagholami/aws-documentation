Streaming Audio Transcription
Amazon Transcribe Medical enables you to transcribe medical speech in real time. To do this, use a WebSocket protocol to establish a bi-directional connection to the Amazon Transcribe Medical real-time application programming interface. When you send Amazon Transcribe Medical a stream of audio, it returns a stream of JSON objects containing the audio's transcription.
For more information about processing audio streams, see Establish a Bi-Directional Connection Using the WebSocket Protocol.
API Batch Transcription
Amazon Transcribe Medical supports the transcription of individual audio files through asynchronous API batch calls. For more information about transcribing audio files, see How Amazon Transcribe Medical Works
Batch transcription can improve your transcription results. You can also use channel identification to separate and transcribe channels in audio files that have multiple channels. Channel identification generates separate transcripts for each channel and merges them into a single output. To identify speakers in single-channel audio files, use speaker identification. To generate additional alternative transcription results for the same source audio, use alternative transcriptions.
