Speech Input
To transcribe an audio file, you use a transcription job. You store the file as an object in an Amazon S3 bucket. The input file must be: 
 In FLAC, MP3, MP4, or WAV file format
 Less than 4 hours in length or less than 2 Gb of audio data
Specify the language and format of the input file. 
For best results: 
 Use a lossless format, such as FLAC or WAV, with PCM 16-bit encoding.
 Use a sample rate of 8000 Hz for telephone audio.
