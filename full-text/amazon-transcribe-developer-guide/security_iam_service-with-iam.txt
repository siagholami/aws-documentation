How Amazon Transcribe Works with IAM
Before you use IAM to manage access to Amazon Transcribe, you should understand which IAM features are available to use with Amazon Transcribe. To get a high-level view of how Amazon Transcribe and other AWS services work with IAM, see AWS Services That Work with IAM in the IAM User Guide.

Amazon Transcribe Identity-Based Policies
With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources and the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. Amazon Transcribe supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference in the IAM User Guide.
Actions
The Action element of an IAM identity-based policy describes the specific action or actions that will be allowed or denied by the policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. The action is used in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation. 
Policy actions in Amazon Transcribe use the following prefix before the action: transcribe:. For example, to grant someone permission to run an Amazon EC2 instance with the Amazon Transcribe StartTranscriptionJob API operation, you include the transcribe:StartTranscriptionJob action in their policy. Policy statements must include either an Action or NotAction element. Amazon Transcribe defines actions that describe tasks that you can perform with this service.
To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows.
"Action": [
      "transcribe:action1",
      "transcribe:action2"
You can specify multiple actions using wildcards (*). For example, to specify all actions that begin with the word List, include the following action.
"Action": "transcribe:List*"
To see a list of Amazon Transcribe actions, see Actions Defined by Amazon Transcribe in the IAM User Guide.
Resources
Amazon Transcribe doesn't support specifying resource ARNs in a policy.
Condition Keys
Use the Condition element (or a Condition block) to specify conditions in which a statement is in effect. The Condition element is optional. You can build conditional expressions that use condition operators, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request.
If you specify multiple Condition elements in a statement, or multiple keys in a single Condition element, AWS evaluates them using a logical AND operation. If you specify multiple values for a single condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical OR operation. All of the conditions must be met before the statement's permissions are granted.
You can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example, you can grant an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with their IAM user name. For more information, see IAM Policy Elements: Variables and Tags in the IAM User Guide.
Amazon Transcribe defines its own set of condition keys and also supports using some global condition keys. For a list of all AWS global condition keys, see AWS Global Condition Context Keys in the IAM User Guide.
The following table lists the Amazon Transcribe condition keys that apply to Amazon Transcribe resources. You can include these keys in the Condition element in an IAM permissions policy.



Amazon Transcribe Condition Key
Description
Value Type
Action




transcribe:OutputBucketName
Filters access by the output bucket used to start a transcription job.
String
StartTranscriptionJob


transcribe:OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId
Filters access by the KMS key used to start a transcription job.
String
StartTranscriptionJob



For examples of how you can use condition keys to control access to the resources of Amazon Transcribe, see the following.
If you want your users to always use a specific output bucket when they use the StartTranscriptionJob operation, you can use the following policy.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "transcribe:StartTranscriptionJob",
                  ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "transcribe:OutputBucketName": "AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
If you want users to always use a AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key when they use the StartTranscriptionJob operation, you can use the following policy.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "transcribe:StartTranscriptionJob",
                  ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "Null": {
                    "transcribe:OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId": "false"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

Amazon Transcribe Resource-Based Policies
Amazon Transcribe doesn't support resource-based policies.
Amazon Transcribe IAM Roles
An IAM role is an entity within your AWS account that has specific permissions.
Using Temporary Credentials with Amazon Transcribe
You can use temporary credentials to sign in with federation, to assume an IAM role, or to assume a cross-account role. You obtain temporary security credentials by calling AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) API operations, such as AssumeRole or GetFederationToken. 
Amazon Transcribe supports using temporary credentials. 
Service-Linked Roles
Service-linked roles allow AWS services to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, but can't edit, the permissions for service-linked roles.
Amazon Transcribe doesn't support service-linked roles.
Service Roles
You can allow a service to assume a service role on your behalf. This role allows the service to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Service roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the account. This means that an IAM administrator can change the permissions for this role. However, doing so might prevent the service from functioning as expected.
Amazon Transcribe doesn't support service roles.
