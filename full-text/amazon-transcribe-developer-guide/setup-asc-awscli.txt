Step 2: Set up the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
You don't need the AWS CLI to perform the steps in the Getting Started exercises. However, some of the other exercises in this guide do require it. If you prefer, you can skip this step and set up the AWS CLI later. 
To set up the AWS CLI


Download and configure the AWS CLI. For instructions, see the following topics in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide: 
    Getting Set Up with the AWS Command Line Interface
    Configuring the AWS Command Line Interface


In the AWS CLI config file, add a named profile for the administrator user: 


[profile adminuser]
   aws_access_key_id = adminuser access key ID
   aws_secret_access_key = adminuser secret access key
   region = aws-region
You use this profile when executing the AWS CLI commands. For more information about named profiles, see Named Profiles in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. For a list of AWS Regions, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

Verify the setup by typing the following help command at the command prompt: 

aws help
