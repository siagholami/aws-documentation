Sending encrypted or signed email
With S/MIME, you can send signed or encrypted emails inside and outside of your organization. After you configure S/MIME in the email client settings, all emails that you send are automatically signed. Encryption options depend on different email clients and respective platforms. The Amazon WorkMail web app client is not supported.
Note
AWS Certificate Manager does not currently provide certificates to sign and encrypt email. Get the certificate (*.p12) file from your administrator or a third-party certificate authority.
