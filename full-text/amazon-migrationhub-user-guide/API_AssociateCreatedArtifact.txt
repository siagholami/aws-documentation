AssociateCreatedArtifact
Associates a created artifact of an AWS cloud resource, the target receiving the migration, with the migration task performed by a migration tool. This API has the following traits:
 Migration tools can call the AssociateCreatedArtifact operation to indicate which AWS artifact is associated with a migration task.
 The created artifact name must be provided in ARN (Amazon Resource Name) format which will contain information about type and region; for example: arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:488216288981:image/ami-6d0ba87b.
 Examples of the AWS resource behind the created artifact are, AMI's, EC2 instance, or DMS endpoint, etc.
