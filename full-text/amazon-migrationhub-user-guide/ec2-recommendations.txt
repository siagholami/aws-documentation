Amazon EC2 Instance Recommendations
Amazon EC2 instance recommendations provide you with the ability to estimate the cost of running your existing servers in AWS. This feature analyzes the details about each server, including server specification, CPU, and memory utilization data. The compiled data is then used to recommend the least expensive Amazon EC2 instance type that can handle the existing performance workload. Recommendations are returned along with per-hour instance pricing.
Based on your business needs, you can choose additional preferences such as billing options, region, EC2 instance type exclusions and the CPU/RAM sizing (average, peak, percentile) to further optimize your EC2 instance recommendations and associated costs.
Prerequisites
Before you can get Amazon EC2 instance recommendations, you must have data about your on-premises servers in Migration Hub. This data can come from the discovery tools (Discovery Connector or Discovery Agent) or from Migration Hub import. For more information on using these tools and features, see the following links:
 Migration Hub import – This allows you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub using a pre-defined CSV template.
 Discovery Connector – This is a VMware appliance that can collect information only about VMware virtual machines (VMs).
 Discovery Agent – This is AWS software that you install on on-premises servers and VMs targeted for discovery and migration.
Note
Percentile-based recommendations are only generated for servers with data collected by a Discovery Connector from March 12th, 2019 onwards, or by a Discovery Agent.
How EC2 Instance Recommendations Work
This feature recommends the most cost-effective EC2 instance type that can satisfy your existing server specifications and utilization requirements while taking into account your selected instance preferences. The server specifications that are used to generate your recommendations are:
 Number of processors
 Number of logical cores
 Total amount of RAM
 Operating system family
 Usage data including peak, average, and percentiles of CPU and RAM
EC2 instance recommendations returns the best Amazon EC2 instance type match based on server specification as well as the performance dimensions you provided. To match the performance dimensions, the service adjusts the server’s specification by multiplying the original CPU and RAM values by the usage percentage.
Generating Amazon EC2 Recommendations
In the Export EC2 instance recommendations page of the Migration Hub console, you'll choose your recommendation preferences. These preferences include resource sizing, instance type preferences, and instance type exclusions. Use the following procedure to generate your Amazon EC2 instance recommendations.
To generate Amazon EC2 instance recommendations


Open a browser and sign into the Migration Hub console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub.


On the left-side navigation, from Assess, choose EC2 instance recommendations.


Choose your Amazon EC2 instance size preferences for your discovered servers. You can choose one of the following options.
    Current server specification – You have the two options of Direct match or Custom match.

Custom match – Scales the CPU and RAM specifications for your instances relative to the collected specification data. For example setting CPU to 50% and RAM to 60% will generate recommendations that assume 50% utilization of your discovered CPU usage and 60% utilization of your total RAM usage.
Direct match – Matches the recommendations based off of the exact CPU and RAM specification data collected by the discovery tools you used to get the data into Migration Hub.
Maximum utilization – This option sizes your instance recommendations based off of the maximum (peak) CPU and RAM utilization data that was collected by the discovery tools.
Average utilization – This option sizes your instance recommendations based off of the average CPU and RAM utilization data that was imported or collected by the discovery tools.
Percentile of utilization – If you used an AWS Application Discovery Agent or an AWS Agentless Discovery Connector to collect your server data, you can generate your recommendations using percentiles of time-series utilization data. Percentile-based recommendations are only generated for servers with data collected by a Discovery Connector from March 12th, 2019 onwards, or by a Discovery Agent.

For all the data points collected for CPU and RAM utilization, a percentile is a value that exists below a given percentage of utilization since data has been discovered. For example, the 75th percentile represents the value under 75 percent of all the RAM and CPU utilization data that has been discovered.


Choose your Amazon EC2 instance type preferences, including AWS Region, tenancy, and pricing model.
    Region – Your AWS Region selection affects EC2 instance availability and pricing.
    Tenancy – This defines how EC2 instances are distributed across physical hardware and affects pricing.

Shared – Multiple customers may share the same physical hardware.
Dedicated – Only your instances will run on the same physical hardware.
Pricing Model – This defines the kind of billing and commitment you intend to use for your instances.
On-Demand – Requires no long-term commitment.
Reserved – requires 1-3 year commitment and provides discounts and additional confidence in your ability to launch instances when needed. For more information on reserved instance pricing model information, see Reserved Instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances 



Optionally, choose any Amazon EC2 instance type exclusions to prevent specific types of instances from appearing in your recommendations.


When you're done setting your preferences, choose Export recommendations. This will begin generating your recommendations. 


When the process is complete, your browser will automatically download a compressed archive (ZIP) file, containing a comma-separated values (CSV) file with your recommendations. The file is named EC2InstanceRecommendations-sizing-preferences-year-month-day-hour-minute.csv.
Large datasets can take a few minutes to generate recommendations. You can generate new recommendations at any time by repeating this procedure with a different set of preferences.
Understanding Your Amazon EC2 Recommendations
The downloaded CSV file has the following categories of information within it:
 Server identification – This information identifies each server. Each row of the CSV file contains information specific to a single server identified by a ServerID, HostName, and/or ExternalId.
 Requested recommendations – These are your generated results based on your CPU/RAM sizing preferences.
 User preferences – These are the preferences that were specified while requesting recommendations. This information can be used to track and compare different results from generating multiple recommendations for the same set of servers.
 Server configuration – This information defines the set of on-premises servers that were used to generate your recommendations.
The following table defines the different columns for an Amazon EC2 recommendations CSV file.

Additional Considerations
Keep the following considerations in mind when generating EC2 instance recommendations.
 Burstable instances (T2 and T3) have an additional pricing mechanism that is computed based on CPU credits. For the burstable instances, we use the provided average and peak CPU data points to compute an estimated number of consumed CPU credits. This is translated into an adjusted overall recommendation.
 Only current generation instances are recommended. The following types of instances are excluded from recommendations:
   Previous generation instances (C3, for example)
   Bare Metal instances
   ARM instances (A1, for example)
   32-bit instances
 If the operating system for a server is not supported by Amazon EC2, that server's returned recommendation will be Linux. Additional information can be found in the Recommendation.EC2.Remarks column for each affected server.
