Migrate Without Performing Discovery
Directly migrating servers is efficient because your servers are already migrating while you simultaneously group them into applications.
Use this section to guide you through the initial console screens that Migration Hub presents to the first-time user to view, compare, and connect AWS migration tools to Migration Hub.
Remember that if you haven't selected a Migration Hub home region, the first time you view the console, you'll be required to select one.
It is important to understand that connecting an AWS migration tool to Migration Hub is how you authorize that tool to communicate migration status to Migration Hub in your home region. Without this authorization, Migration Hub will not track your migration. 
To learn more about integrated migration tools, including AWS and partner tools, go to the Migration Tools page in Migration Hub (Migrate -> Tools) and follow the link to the documentation or to AWS Marketplace.
Once you've completed the new user screens, refer to the AWS Migration Hub Walkthroughs for remaining steps.


If you chose Get started migrating in the new user screen, the Migrate Without Performing Discovery screen is displayed. Choose Connect migration tools.



This takes you to the following screen where you can choose and authorize AWS migration tools or integrated partners' tools.
