Getting Started with the AWS SDK for JavaScript
The AWS SDK for JavaScript provides access to web services in either browser scripts or Node.js. This section has two getting started exercises that show you how to work with the SDK for JavaScript in each of these JavaScript environments.
You can also develop Node.js applications using the SDK for JavaScript in the AWS Cloud9 IDE. For a sample of how to use AWS Cloud9 for Node.js development, see Node.js Sample for AWS Cloud9 in the AWS Cloud9 User Guide.
