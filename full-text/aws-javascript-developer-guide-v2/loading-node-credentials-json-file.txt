Loading Credentials in Node.js from a JSON File
You can load configuration and credentials from a JSON document on disk using AWS.config.loadFromPath. The path specified is relative to the current working directory of your process. For example, to load credentials from a 'config.json' file with the following content:
{ "accessKeyId": <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>, "secretAccessKey": <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>, "region": "us-east-1" }
Use the following command:
AWS.config.loadFromPath('./config.json');
Note
Loading configuration data from a JSON document resets all existing configuration data. Add additional configuration data after using this technique. Loading credentials from a JSON document is not supported in browser scripts.
