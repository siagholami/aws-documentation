Deleting an AWS Lambda function by using the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains
You can use the AWS Toolkit to delete an AWS Lambda function that is part of an AWS serverless application, or you can delete a standalone Lambda function.
To delete a Lambda function that is part of an AWS serverless application, skip the rest of this topic and see Deleting an application instead.
To delete a standalone Lambda function, do the following.


Open AWS Explorer, if it isn't already open. If you need to switch to a different AWS Region that contains the function, do that now.


Expand Lambda.


Right-click the name of the function to delete, and then choose Delete Function.



Enter the function's name to confirm the deletion, and then choose OK. If the function deletion succeeds, the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains removes the function name from the Lambda list.
