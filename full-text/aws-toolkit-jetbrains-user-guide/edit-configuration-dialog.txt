Build function inside a container
Optional. If selected, the AWS SAM CLI builds any of the serverless application's functions inside of an AWS Lambda-like Docker container locally before deployment. This is useful if the function depends on packages that have natively compiled dependencies or programs. For more information, see Building Applications with Dependencies in the AWS Serverless Application Model Developer Guide.
Skip checking for newer container images
Optional. If selected, the AWS SAM CLI skips pulling down the latest Docker image for the runtime that is specified on the Configuration tab.
Docker Network
Optional. The name or ID of an existing Docker network that Lambda Docker containers should connect to, and the default bridge network. If not specified, the Lambda containers will connect to only the default bridge Docker network.

Edit Configuration dialog box (Amazon ECS cluster)
The Edit configuration dialog box contains two tabs: Configuration and AWS Connection.

The Configuration tab of the Edit configuration dialog box contains the following items.
Name
Required. The name of this configuration.
Share / Share through VCS
Optional. If selected, makes this configuration available to other team members. 1
Allow parallel run / Allow running in parallel 
Optional. If selected, allows IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, or JetBrains Rider to launch as many instances of the configuration to run in parallel as needed. 1
Cluster
Required. The name of the Amazon ECS cluster to debug.
Service
Required. The name of the Amazon ECS service in the cluster to debug.
Add Container
Adds a container to this configuration. Optional if at least one tab is already visible. Each tab represents a separate container.
The following items apply to the selected container: Platform, Remote Debug Port, Start Command, Artifacts Mappings, and Port Mappings. 
Platform
Required. The debug platform to use.
Remote Debug Port
Optional. The port to attach to the debugger.Generally, you should not specify this unless your service uses ports 20020-20030. If it does, specify that port here, so that the container doesnâ€™t try to bind ports that might otherwise be in use elsewhere.
Start Command
Required. The command to start your program so that the debugger can attach to it. For Java, it should start with java and contain no debugger information (such as -Xdebug). For Python, it must start with python, python2, or python3, followed by the path and name of the file to run.
Artifacts Mappings
Required. A Local Path on your local development machine that maps to a Remote Path within the container. All code and artifacts that are to be run must be mapped. To specify a local and remote path mapping, choose Add (the  icon).
Port Mappings
Optional. A Local Port on your local development machine that maps to a Remote Port within the container. This allows local ports to communicate directly with ports on a remote resource. For example, for the command curl localhost:3422, port 3422 maps to some service. To specify a local and remote port mapping, choose Add (the  icon).
