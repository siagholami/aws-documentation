Changing (updating) AWS Serverless application settings by using the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains
You must first deploy the AWS serverless application that you want to change, if you haven't deployed it already.
Note
To deploy a serverless application that contains an AWS Lambda function, and deploy that function with any nondefault or optional properties, you must first set those properties in the function's corresponding AWS SAM template file (for example, in a file named template.yaml within the project). For a list of available properties, see AWS::Serverless::Function in the awslabs/serverless-application-model repository on GitHub.


With the Project tool window already open and displaying the project that contains the serverless application's files, open the project's template.yaml file. Change the file's contents to reflect the new settings, and then save and close the file.


If you need to switch to a different AWS Region to deploy the serverless application to, do that now.


Right-click the project's template.yaml file, and then choose Deploy Serverless Application.



Complete the Deploy Serverless Application dialog box, and then choose Deploy. The AWS Toolkit for JetBrains updates the corresponding AWS CloudFormation stack for the deployment. 


If the deployment fails, you can try to figure out why by viewing event logs for the stack.
