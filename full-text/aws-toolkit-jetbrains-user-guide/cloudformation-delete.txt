Deleting an AWS CloudFormation stack by using the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains


Open AWS Explorer, if it isn't already open. If you need to switch to a different AWS Region that contains the stack, do that now.


Expand CloudFormation.


Right-click the name of the stack to delete, and then choose Delete CloudFormation Stack.



Enter the stack's name to confirm it's deleted, and then choose OK. If the stack deletion succeeds, the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains removes the stack name from the CloudFormation list in AWS Explorer. If the stack deletion fails, you can troubleshoot by viewing the event logs for the stack.
