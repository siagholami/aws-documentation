trunc(Decimal, Integer)
Truncates the first argument to the number of Decimal places specified by the second argument. If the second argument is less than zero, it will be set to zero. If the second argument is greater than 34, it will be set to 34. Trailing zeros are stripped from the result.
Examples:
trunc(2.3, 0) = 2
trunc(2.3123, 2) = 2.31
trunc(2.888, 2) = 2.88
trunc(2.00, 5) = 2
