Filter activity
A filteractivity filters a message based on its attributes. The expression used in this activity looks like an SQL WHERE clause which must return a Boolean.
{
    "filter": {
        "name": "MyFilterActivity",
        "filter": "temp > 40 AND hum < 20",
        "next": "MyDatastoreActivity"
    }
}
