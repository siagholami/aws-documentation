Keeping multiple versions of datasets
You can choose how many versions of your data set contents to retain, and for how long, by specifying values for the data set retentionPeriod and versioningConfiguration fields when invoking the CreateDataset and UpdateDataset APIs:
...
"retentionPeriod": {
  "unlimited": "boolean",
  "numberOfDays": "integer"
},
"versioningConfiguration": {
  "unlimited": "boolean",
  "maxVersions": "integer"
},
...
The settings of these two parameters work together to determine how many versions of data set contents are retained, and for how long, in the following ways.
