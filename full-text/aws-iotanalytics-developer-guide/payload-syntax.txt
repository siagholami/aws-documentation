Message payload syntax
The field names of message payloads (data) that you send to AWS IoT Analytics: 
 Must contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores (_); no other special characters are allowed
 Must begin with an alphabetic character or single underscore (_).
 Cannot contain hyphens (-).
 In regular expression terms: "^[A-Za-z_]([A-Za-z0-9]*|[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_]*)$". 
 Cannot be greater than 255 characters.
 Are case-insensitive. Fields named "foo" and "FOO" in the same payload are considered duplicates.
For example, {"temp_01": 29} or {"_temp_01": 29} are valid, but {"temp-01": 29}, {"01_temp": 29} or {"__temp_01": 29} are invalid in message payloads.
