Pipeline activities
The simplest functional pipeline connects a channel to a data store, which makes it a pipeline with two activities: a channel activity and a datastore activity. You can achieve more powerful message processing by adding additional activities to your pipeline. 
You can use the RunPipelineActivity operation to simulate the results of running a pipeline activity on a message payload you provide. You might find this helpful when you are developing and debugging your pipeline activities. RunPipelineActivity example demonstrates how it is used.
