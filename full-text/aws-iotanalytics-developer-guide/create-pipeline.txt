Creating a pipeline
A pipeline consumes messages from a channel and enables you to process and filter the messages before storing them in a data store. To connect a channel to a data store, you create a pipeline. The simplest possible pipeline contains no activities other than specifying the channel that collects the data and identifying the data store to which the messages are sent. For information about more complicated pipelines, see Pipeline activities.
When starting out, we recommend that you create a pipeline that does nothing other than connect a channel to a data store. Then, after you verify that raw data flows to the data store, you can introduce additional pipeline activities to process this data.
Run the following command to create a pipeline.
aws iotanalytics create-pipeline --cli-input-json file://mypipeline.json
The mypipeline.json file contains the following content.
{
    "pipelineName": "mypipeline",
    "pipelineActivities": [
        {
            "channel": {
                "name": "mychannelactivity",
                "channelName": "mychannel",
                "next": "mystoreactivity"
            }
        },
        {
            "datastore": {
                "name": "mystoreactivity",
                "datastoreName": "mydatastore"
            }
        }
    ]
}
Run the following command to list your existing pipelines.
aws iotanalytics list-pipelines
Run the following command to view the configuration of an individual pipeline.
aws iotanalytics describe-pipeline  --pipeline-name mypipeline
