Deployment Using the AWS Toolkit
The Toolkit for Visual Studio supports application deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk containers or AWS CloudFormation stacks.
  Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk describes how to use the Visual Studio IDE to deploy applications to Elastic Beanstalk.
  Deploying to Amazon EC2 Container Service describes how to use the Visual Studio IDE to deploy applications to Amazon ECS.
  Standalone Deployment Tool describes how to use the standalone deployment tool to deploy to either Elastic Beanstalk containers or AWS CloudFormation stacks from a command window.
Note
If you are using Visual Studio Express Edition:
You can use the standalone deployment tool to deploy applications to Elastic Beanstalk containers.
You can use the Docker CLI to deploy applications to Amazon ECS containers.
You can use the AWS Management Console to deploy applications to Elastic Beanstalk containers.
For Elastic Beanstalk deployments, you must first create a web deployment package. For more information, see How to: Create a Web Deployment Package in Visual Studio. For Amazon ECS deployment, you must have a Docker image. For more information, see Visual Studio Tools for Docker.
