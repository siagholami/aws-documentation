Quotas in Amazon Aurora
Each AWS account has quotas, for each AWS Region, on the number of Amazon Aurora resources that can be created. After a quota for a resource has been reached, additional calls to create that resource fail with an exception.
The following table lists the resources and their quotas per AWS Region.

Reserved DB instances
40


Rules per virtual private cloud (VPC) security group
50 inbound, 50 outbound


Subnets per subnet group
20


Tags per resource
50


VPC security groups
5



Note
By default, you can have up to a total of 40 DB instances. RDS DB instances, Aurora DB instances, Amazon Neptune instances, and Amazon DocumentDB instances apply to this quota.
If your application requires more DB instances, you can request additional DB instances by opening the Service Quotas console. In the navigation pane, choose AWS services. Choose Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), choose a quota, and follow the directions to request a quota increase. For more information, see Requesting a Quota Increase in the Service Quotas User Guide.
Backups managed by AWS Backup are considered manual cluster snapshots for the manual cluster snapshots quota. For information about AWS Backup, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide.
Naming Constraints in Amazon Aurora
The following table describes naming constraints in Amazon Aurora. 




Resource or Item
Constraints




DB cluster identifier
Identifiers have these naming constraints: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Initial database name
Database name constraints differ between Aurora MySQL and PostgreSQL. For more information, see the available settings when creating each DB cluster.


Master user name
Master user name constraints differ for each database engine. For more information, see the available settings when creating each DB cluster.


Master password
The password for the database master user can include any printable ASCII character except /, ", @, or a space. Master password length constraints differ for each database engine. For more information, see the available settings when creating each DB cluster.


DB parameter group name
These names have these constraints: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


DB subnet group name
These names have these constraints: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]



Amazon Aurora Size Limits
For Aurora MySQL, the maximum table size is only constrained by the size of the Aurora cluster volume. The maximum DB cluster volume is 128 tebibytes (TiB) for Aurora MySQL and 64 TiB for Aurora PostgreSQL. For an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, the maximum table size is 32 terabytes (TB). We recommend that you follow table design best practices, such as partitioning of large tables.
