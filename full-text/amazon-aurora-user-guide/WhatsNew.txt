Aurora parallel query enhancements
Starting with Aurora MySQL 2.09 and 1.23, you can take advantage of enhancements to the parallel query feature. Creating a parallel query cluster no longer requires a special engine mode. You can now turn parallel query on and off using the aurora_parallel_query configuration option for any provisioned cluster that's running a compatible Aurora MySQL version. You can upgrade an existing cluster to a compatible Aurora MySQL version and use parallel query, instead of creating a new cluster and importing data into it. You can use Performance Insights for parallel query clusters. You can stop and start parallel query clusters. You can create Aurora parallel query clusters that are compatible with MySQL 5.7. Parallel query works for tables that use the DYNAMIC row format. Parallel query clusters can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication. Reader DB instances in parallel query clusters can take advantage of the READ COMMITTED isolation level. You can also now create parallel query clusters in additional AWS Regions. For more information about the parallel query feature and these enhancements, see Working with Parallel Query for Aurora MySQL.
