App Mesh service quotas
AWS App Mesh has integrated with Service Quotas, an AWS service that enables you to view and manage your quotas from a central location. Service quotas are also referred to as limits. For more information, see What Is Service Quotas? in the Service Quotas User Guide.
Service Quotas makes it easy to look up the value of all of the App Mesh service quotas.
To view App Mesh service quotas using the AWS Management Console


Open the Service Quotas console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/.


In the navigation pane, choose AWS services.


From the AWS services list, search for and select AWS App Mesh.


In the Service quotas list, you can see the service quota name, applied value (if it is available), AWS default quota, and whether the quota value is adjustable.

To view additional information about a service quota, such as the description, choose the quota name.

To request a quota increase, see Requesting a Quota Increase in the Service Quotas User Guide.
