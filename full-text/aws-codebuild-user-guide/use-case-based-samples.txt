CodeBuild use case-based samples
You can use these use case-based samples to experiment with AWS CodeBuild:
 Access token sample 
Shows how to use access tokens in CodeBuild to connect to GitHub and Bitbucket.
Amazon ECR sample
Uses a Docker image in an Amazon ECR repository to use Apache Maven to produce a single JAR file.
Amazon EFS sample
Shows how to configure a buildspec file so that a CodeBuild project mounts and builds on an Amazon EFS file system.
AWS CodeDeploy sample
Uses Apache Maven to produce a single JAR file. Uses CodeDeploy to deploy the JAR file to an Amazon Linux instance. You can also use CodePipeline to build and deploy the sample.
 AWS CodePipeline integration with batch builds sample  AWS CodePipeline integration with multiple input sources and output artifacts sample 
Shows how to use AWS CodePipeline to create a build with multiple input sources and multiple output artifacts.
AWS Config sample
Shows how to set up AWS Config. Lists which CodeBuild resources are tracked and describes how to look up CodeBuild projects in AWS Config.
AWS Elastic Beanstalk sample
Uses Apache Maven to produce a single WAR file. Uses Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the WAR file to an Elastic Beanstalk instance.
Bitbucket pull request and webhook filter sample
Uses CodeBuild with Bitbucket as the source repository and webhooks enabled, to rebuild the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository.
Build badges sample
Shows how to set up CodeBuild with build badges.
Build notifications sample
Uses Apache Maven to produce a single JAR file. Sends a build notification to subscribers of an Amazon SNS topic.
Create a test report using the AWS CLI sample
Uses the AWS CLI to create, run, and view the results of a test report.
Docker in custom image sample
Uses a custom Docker image to produce a Docker image.
Docker sample
Uses a build image provided by CodeBuild with Docker support to produce a Docker image with Apache Maven. Pushes the Docker image to a repository in Amazon ECR. You can also adapt this sample to push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
GitHub Enterprise Server sample
Uses CodeBuild with GitHub Enterprise Server as the source repository, with certificates installed and webhooks enabled, to rebuild the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository.
GitHub pull request and webhook filter sample
Uses CodeBuild with GitHub as the source repository and webhooks enabled, to rebuild the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository.
 Host build output in an S3 bucket 
Shows how to create a static website in an S3 bucket using unencrypted build artifacts.
 Multiple input sources and output artifacts sample 
Shows how to use multiple input sources and multiple output artifacts in a build project.
Private registry with AWS Secrets Manager sample
Shows how to use a Docker image in a private registry as the runtime environment when building with CodeBuild The private registry credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
 Runtime versions in buildspec file sample 
Shows how to specify runtimes and their versions in the buildspec file. This is a requirement when using the Ubuntu standard image version 2.0.
Source version sample
Shows how to use a specific version of your source in a CodeBuild build project.
Use semantic versioning to name build artifacts sample
Shows how to use semantic versioning to create an artifact name at build time.
