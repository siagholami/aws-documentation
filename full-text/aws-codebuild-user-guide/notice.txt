MICROSOFT SOFTWARE SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS
CONTAINER OS IMAGE
Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) (referenced as "us," "we," or "Microsoft") licenses this Container OS Image supplement to you ("Supplement"). You are licensed to use this Supplement in conjunction with the underlying host operating system software ("Host Software") solely to assist running the containers feature in the Host Software.

You may use this Supplement with each validly licensed copy of the Host Software.
ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS

For clarity, a Container Image is separate and distinct from a virtual machine or virtual appliance image. Pursuant to these license terms, we grant you a restricted right to redistribute such Supplement components under the following conditions:
(i) you may use the Supplement components only as used in, and as a part of your Container Image,
(ii) you may use such Supplement components in your Container Image as long as you have significant primary functionality in your Container Image that is materially separate and distinct from the Supplement; and
(iii) you agree to include these license terms (or similar terms required by us or a hoster) with your Container Image to properly license the possible use of the Supplement components by your end-users.
We reserve all other rights not expressly granted herein.
By using this Supplement, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use this Supplement.
As part of the Supplemental License Terms for this Container OS Image for Windows containers, you are also subject to the underlying Windows Server host software license terms, which are located at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/useterms.
