Use AWS Config with CodeBuild sample
AWS Config provides an inventory of your AWS resources and a history of configuration changes to these resources. AWS Config now supports AWS CodeBuild as an AWS resource, which means the service can track your CodeBuild projects. For more information about AWS Config, see What is AWS Config? in the AWS Config Developer Guide.
You can see the following information about CodeBuild resources on the Resource Inventory page in the AWS Config console:
 A timeline of your CodeBuild configuration changes.
 Configuration details for each CodeBuild project.
 Relationships with other AWS resources.
 A list of changes to your CodeBuild projects.
The procedures in this topic show you how to set up AWS Config and look up and view CodeBuild projects.

Look up AWS CodeBuild projects


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Config console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/config. 


On the Resource inventory page, choose Resources. Scroll down and select the CodeBuild project check box.



Choose Look up.


After the list of CodeBuild projects is added, choose the CodeBuild project name link in the Config timeline column.


Viewing AWS CodeBuild configuration details in the AWS Config console
When you look up resources on the Resource inventory page, you can choose the AWS Config timeline to view details about your CodeBuild project. The details page for a resource provides information about the configuration, relationships, and number of changes made to that resource. 
The blocks at the top of the page are collectively called the timeline. The timeline shows the date and time that the recording was made.
For more information, see Viewing configuration details in the AWS Config console in the AWS Config Developer Guide.
