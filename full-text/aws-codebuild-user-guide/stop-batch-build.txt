Stop a batch build (console)


Open the AWS CodeBuild console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/home.


Do one of the following:
    If the build-project-name:*build-ID page is displayed, choose Stop build.
    In the navigation pane, choose Build history. In the list of builds, select the box for the build, and then choose Stop build.
    In the navigation pane, choose Build projects. In the list of build projects, in the Name column, choose the link for the build project's name. In the list of builds, select the box for the build, and then choose Stop build*.


Note
By default, only the most recent 100 builds or build projects are displayed. To view more builds or build projects, choose the gear icon, and then choose a different value for Builds per page or Projects per page or use the back and forward arrows.
If AWS CodeBuild cannot successfully stop a batch build (for example, if the build process is already complete), the Stop build button is disabled.
Stop a batch build (AWS CLI)

Run the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/codebuild/stop-build-batch.html command:

aws codebuild stop-build-batch --id <batch-build-id>
In the preceding command, replace the following placeholder:
   : Required string. The identifier of the batch build to stop. To get a list of batch build identifiers, see the following topics:
     View a list of batch build IDs (AWS CLI)
     View a list of batch build IDs for a build project (AWS CLI)
If AWS CodeBuild successfully stops the batch build, the buildBatchStatus value in the buildBatch object in the output is STOPPED.
If CodeBuild cannot successfully stop the batch build (for example, if the batch build is already complete), the buildBatchStatus value in the buildBatch object in the output is the final build status (for example, SUCCEEDED).
Stop a batch build (AWS SDKs)
