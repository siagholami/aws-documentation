View a list of build project names (console)
You can view a list of build projects in an AWS Region in the console. Information includes the name, source provider, repository, latest build status, and description, if any.


Open the AWS CodeBuild console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Build projects.
Note
By default, only the 10 most recent build projects are displayed. To view more build projects, choose the gear icon, and then choose a different value for Projects per page or use the back and forward arrows.


View a list of build project names (AWS CLI)
Run the list-projects command:
aws codebuild list-projects --sort-by sort-by --sort-order sort-order --next-token next-token
In the preceding command, replace the following placeholders:
 sort-by: Optional string used to indicate the criterion to be used to list build project names. Valid values include:
   CREATED_TIME: List the build project names based on when each build project was created. 
   LAST_MODIFIED_TIME: List the build project names based on when information about each build project was last changed. 
   NAME: List the build project names based on each build project's name.
 sort-order: Optional string used to indicate the order in which to list build projects, based on sort-by. Valid values include ASCENDING and DESCENDING.
 next-token: Optional string. During a previous run, if there were more than 100 items in the list, only the first 100 items are returned, along with a unique string called next token. To get the next batch of items in the list, run this command again, adding the next token to the call. To get all of the items in the list, keep running this command with each subsequent next token, until no more next tokens are returned.
For example, if you run this command:
aws codebuild list-projects --sort-by NAME --sort-order ASCENDING
A result similar to the following might appear in the output:
{
  "nextToken": "Ci33ACF6...The full token has been omitted for brevity...UAkMx8=",
  "projects": [
    "codebuild-demo-project",
    "codebuild-demo-project2",
    ... The full list of build project names has been omitted for brevity ...
    "codebuild-demo-project99"
  ]
}
If you run this command again:
aws codebuild list-projects  --sort-by NAME --sort-order ASCENDING --next-token Ci33ACF6...The full token has been omitted for brevity...UAkMx8=
A result similar to the following might appear in the output:
{
  "projects": [
    "codebuild-demo-project100",
    "codebuild-demo-project101",
    ... The full list of build project names has been omitted for brevity ...
    "codebuild-demo-project122"
  ]
}
