Monitoring CodeBuild metrics
AWS CodeBuild monitors functions on your behalf and reports metrics through Amazon CloudWatch. These metrics include the number of total builds, failed builds, successful builds, and the duration of builds. 
You can use the CodeBuild console or the CloudWatch console to monitor metrics for CodeBuild. The following procedures show you how to access metrics.
