Step 9: Get the build output artifact
(Previous step: Step 8: View detailed build information)
In this step, you get the messageUtil-1.0.jar file that CodeBuild built and uploaded to the output bucket.
You can use the CodeBuild console or the Amazon S3 console to complete this step.
To get the build output artifact (AWS CodeBuild console)


With the CodeBuild console still open and the build details page still displayed from the previous step, choose the Build details tab and scroll down to the Artifacts section. 
Note
If the build details page is not displayed, in the navigation bar, choose Build history, and then choose the Build run link.


The link to the Amazon S3 folder is under the Artifacts upload location. This link opens the folder in Amazon S3 where you find the messageUtil-1.0.jar build output artifact file.


To get the build output artifact (Amazon S3 console)


Open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


Open codebuild-region-ID-account-ID-output-bucket.


Open the codebuild-demo-project folder.


Open the target folder, where you find the messageUtil-1.0.jar build output artifact file.
