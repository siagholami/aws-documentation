Remove a tag from a report group
You can remove one or more tags associated with a report group. Removing a tag does not delete the tag from other AWS resources that are associated with that tag.
Important
Removing tags for a report group can impact access to that report group. Before you remove a tag from a report group, make sure to review any IAM policies that might use the key or value for a tag to control access to resources such as report groups. For examples of tag-based access policies, see Using tags to control access to AWS CodeBuild resources.
Remove a tag from a report group (console)
You can use the CodeBuild console to remove the association between a tag and a CodeBuild report group. 


Open the CodeBuild console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/.


In Report groups, choose the name of the report group where you want to remove tags.


In the navigation pane, choose Settings.


Choose Edit.


Find the tag you want to remove, and then choose Remove tag.


When you have finished removing tags, choose Submit.


Remove a tag from a report group (AWS CLI)
Follow these steps to use the AWS CLI to remove a tag from a CodeBuild report group. Removing a tag does not delete it, but simply removes the association between the tag and the report group. 
Note
If you delete a CodeBuild report group, all tag associations are removed from the deleted report group. You do not have to remove tags before you delete a report group.
To delete one or more tags from a report group, see Edit tags for a report group (AWS CLI). Update the tags section in the JSON-formatted data with an updated list of tags that does not contain the ones you want to delete. If you want to delete all tags, update the tags section to:
"tags: []"
