Stop running builds automatically (AWS CLI)
If your source code is stored in a GitHub or a GitHub Enterprise Server repository, you can set up GitHub webhooks to have AWS CodeBuild rebuild your source code whenever a code change is pushed to the repository. For more information, see Start running builds automatically (AWS CLI).
If you have enabled this behavior, you can turn it off by running the delete-webhook command as follows:
aws codebuild delete-webhook --project-name <project-name>
 where  is the name of the build project that contains the source code to be rebuilt.
If this command is successful, no information and no errors appear in the output.
Note
This deletes the webhook from your CodeBuild project only. You should also delete the webhook from your GitHub or GitHub Enterprise Server repository.
