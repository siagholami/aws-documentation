Security in AWS CodeBuild
Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.
Security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. This shared model can help relieve your operational burden: AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the service facilities. You assume responsibility and management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches) and other associated application software. You're also responsible for the configuration of the AWS provided security group firewall. Your responsibilities vary with the services you use, the integration of those services into your IT environment, and applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, you should carefully consider the services that your organization uses. For more information, see Shared responsibility model.
