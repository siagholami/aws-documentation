Delete a build project in AWS CodeBuild
You can use the CodeBuild console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to delete a build project in CodeBuild. If you delete a project, its builds are not deleted.
Warning
You cannot delete a project that has builds and a resource policy. To delete a project with a resource policy and builds, you must first remove the resource policy and delete its builds.
