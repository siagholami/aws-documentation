Getting started with CodeBuild
In the following tutorials, you use AWS CodeBuild to build a collection of sample source code input files into a deployable version of the source code.
Both tutorials have the same input and results, but one uses the AWS CodeBuild console and the other uses the AWS CLI. 
Important
We do not recommend that you use your AWS root account to complete this tutorial.
