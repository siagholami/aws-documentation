Step 8: View detailed build information
(Previous step: Step 7: View summarized build information)
In this step, you view detailed information about your build in CloudWatch Logs.
Note
 To protect sensitive information, the following are hidden in CodeBuild logs: 
 AWS access key IDs. For more information, see Managing Access Keys for IAM Users in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide. 
 Strings specified using the Parameter Store. For more information, see Systems Manager Parameter Store and Systems Manager Parameter Store Console Walkthrough in the Amazon EC2 Systems Manager User Guide. 
 Strings specified using AWS Secrets Manager. For more information, see Key management. 
To view detailed build information


Use your web browser to go to the deepLink location that appeared in the output in the previous step (for example, https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=region-ID#logEvent:group=/aws/codebuild/codebuild-demo-project;stream=38ca1c4a-e9ca-4dbc-bef1-d52bfEXAMPLE).


In the CloudWatch Logs log stream, you can browse the log events. By default, only the last set of log events is displayed. To see earlier log events, scroll to the beginning of the list.


In this tutorial, most of the log events contain verbose information about CodeBuild downloading and installing build dependency files into its build environment, which you probably don't care about. You can use the Filter events box to reduce the information displayed. For example, if you enter "[INFO]" in Filter events, only those events that contain [INFO] are displayed. For more information, see Filter and pattern syntax in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.


These portions of a CloudWatch Logs log stream pertain to this tutorial.
