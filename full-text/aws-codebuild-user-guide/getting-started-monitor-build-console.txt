To view summarized build information


If the codebuild-demo-project:build-ID page is not displayed, in the navigation bar, choose Build history. Next, in the list of build projects, for Project, choose the Build run link for codebuild-demo-project. There should be only one matching link. (If you have completed this tutorial before, choose the link with the most recent value in the Completed column.)


On the build details page, in Phase details, the following build phases should be displayed, with Succeeded in the Status column:
    SUBMITTED
    QUEUED
    PROVISIONING
    DOWNLOAD_SOURCE
    INSTALL
    PRE_BUILD
    BUILD
    POST_BUILD
    UPLOAD_ARTIFACTS
    FINALIZING
    COMPLETED


In Build Status, Succeeded should be displayed.
If you see In Progress instead, choose the refresh button. 

Next to each build phase, the Duration value indicates how long the build phase lasted. The End time value indicates when that build phase ended.
