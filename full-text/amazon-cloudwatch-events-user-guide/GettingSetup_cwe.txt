Setting Up Amazon CloudWatch Events
To use Amazon CloudWatch Events you need an AWS account. Your AWS account allows you to use services (for example, Amazon EC2) to generate events that you can view in the CloudWatch console, a web-based interface. In addition, you can install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to use a command-line interface.
Sign Up for Amazon Web Services (AWS)
When you create an AWS account, we automatically sign up your account for all AWS services. You pay only for the services that you use. 
If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next step. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one.
To sign up for an AWS account


Open https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.


Follow the online instructions.


Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.
Sign in to the Amazon CloudWatch Console
To sign in to the Amazon CloudWatch console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


If necessary, change the region. From the navigation bar, choose the region where you have your AWS resources.


In the navigation pane, choose Events.


Account Credentials
Although you can use your root user credentials to access CloudWatch Events, we recommend that you use an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) account. If you're using an IAM account to access CloudWatch, you must have the following permissions:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "events:*",
        "iam:PassRole"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
For more information, see Authentication.
Set Up the Command Line Interface
You can use the AWS CLI to perform CloudWatch Events operations.
For information about how to install and configure the AWS CLI, see Getting Set Up with the AWS Command Line Interface in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
Regional Endpoints
You must enable regional endpoints (the default) in order to use CloudWatch Events. For more information, see Activating and Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region in the IAM User Guide.
