Creating a CloudWatch Events Rule That Triggers on an AWS API Call Using AWS CloudTrail
To create a rule that triggers on an action by an AWS service that does not emit events, you can base the rule on API calls made by that service. The API calls are recorded by AWS CloudTrail. CloudTrail generally detects all AWS API calls except those calls that begin with Get, List, or Describe. For more information about the API calls that you can use as triggers for rules, see Services Supported by CloudTrail Event History.
Rules in CloudWatch Events work only in the Region in which they are created. If you configure CloudTrail to track API calls in multiple Regions, and you want a rule based on CloudTrail to trigger in each of those Regions, you must create a separate rule in each Region that you want to track.
All events that are delivered via CloudTrail have AWS API Call via CloudTrail as the value for detail-type.
Note
In CloudWatch Events, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.
To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change. 
An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit. For more information, see Managing Your Costs with Budgets.
To create a rule that triggers on an API call via CloudTrail:


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Events, Create rule.


For Event source, do the following:


Choose Event Pattern, Build event pattern to match events by service.


For Service Name, choose the service that uses the API operations to use as the trigger.


For Event Type, choose AWS API Call via CloudTrail.


To trigger your rule when any API operation for this service is called, choose Any operation. To trigger your rule only when certain API operations are called, choose Specific operation(s), type the name of an operation in the next box, and then press ENTER. To add more operations, choose .


For Targets, choose Add Target and choose the AWS service that is to act when an event of the selected type is detected. 


In the other fields in this section, enter information specific to this target type, if any is needed. 


For many target types, CloudWatch Events needs permissions to send events to the target. In these cases, CloudWatch Events can create the IAM role needed for your event to run: 
    To create an IAM role automatically, choose Create a new role for this specific resource.
    To use an IAM role that you created before, choose Use existing role.


Optionally, repeat steps 4-6 to add another target for this rule.


Choose Configure details. For Rule definition, type a name and description for the rule. 


Choose Create rule.
