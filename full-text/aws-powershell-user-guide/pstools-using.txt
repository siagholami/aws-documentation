This section provides examples of using the AWS Tools for PowerShell to access AWS services. These examples help demonstrate how to use the cmdlets to perform actual AWS tasks.
PowerShell File Concatenation Encoding
Some cmdlets in the AWS Tools for PowerShell edit existing files or records that you have in AWS. An example is Edit-R53ResourceRecordSet, which calls the ChangeResourceRecordSets API for Amazon RouteÂ 53.
When you edit or concatenate files in PowerShell 5.1 or older releases, PowerShell encodes the output in UTF-16, not UTF-8. This can add unwanted characters and create results that are not valid. A hexadecimal editor can reveal the unwanted characters.
To avoid converting file output to UTF-16, you can pipe your command into PowerShell's Out-File cmdlet and specify UTF-8 encoding, as shown in the following example:
PS > *some file concatenation command* | Out-File filename.txt -Encoding utf8
If you are running AWS CLI commands from within the PowerShell console, the same behavior applies. You can pipe the output of an AWS CLI command into Out-File in the PowerShell console. Other cmdlets, such as Export-Csv or Export-Clixml, also have an Encoding parameter. For a complete list of cmdlets that have an Encoding parameter, and that allow you to correct the encoding of the output of a concatenated file, run the following command:
PS > Get-Command -ParameterName "Encoding"
Note
PowerShell 6.0 and newer, including PowerShell Core, automatically retains UTF-8 encoding for concatenated file output.
Returned Objects for the PowerShell Tools
To make AWS Tools for PowerShell more useful in a native PowerShell environment, the object returned by a AWS Tools for PowerShell cmdlet is a .NET object, not the JSON text object that is typically returned from the corresponding API in the AWS SDK. For example, Get-S3Bucket emits a Buckets collection, not an Amazon S3 JSON response object. The Buckets collection can be placed in the PowerShell pipeline and interacted with in appropriate ways. Similarly, Get-EC2Instance emits a Reservation .NET object collection, not a DescribeEC2Instances JSON result object. This behavior is by design and enables the AWS Tools for PowerShell experience to be more consistent with idiomatic PowerShell.
The actual service responses are available for you if you need them. They are stored as note properties on the returned objects. For API actions that support paging by using NextToken fields, these are also attached as note properties.
