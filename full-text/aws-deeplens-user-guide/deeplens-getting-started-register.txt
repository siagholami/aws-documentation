Register Your AWS DeepLens Device
To run your deep learning computer vision application on your AWS DeepLens device, you must first register the device with AWS. After it's registered, you can create an AWS DeepLens project in the AWS Cloud. You'll also be able to deploy the project to the registered device and update the device software and settings. 
Before registering your device, make sure that you have met all the requirements discussed in Set Up Your AWS DeepLens Development Environment. 
The registration process is different for each version of the AWS DeepLens hardware. Check the hardware version printed on the bottom of your AWS DeepLens device 

and then follow the version-specific instructions provided below.
