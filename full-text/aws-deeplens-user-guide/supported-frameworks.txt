With AWS DeepLens, you train a project model using a supported deep learning modeling framework. You can train the model on the AWS Cloud or elsewhere. Currently, AWS DeepLens supports Caffe, TensorFlow and Apache MXNet frameworks, as well Gluon models. For more information, see Machine Learning Frameworks Supported by AWS DeepLens.
