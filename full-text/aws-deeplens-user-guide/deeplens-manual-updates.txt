Update Your AWS DeepLens Device
When you set up your device, you had the option to enable automatic updates (see Set Up Your AWS DeepLens Device). If you enabled automatic updates, you need only to reboot the device to get the software updated on your device. If you didn't enable automatic updates, you need to manually update your device periodically.
Note
 If your updates gets stuck in an endless loop, try to check and turn on the Unsupported updates option under Install updates from: on the Updates tab in Software & Updates, an Ubuntu system utility on the device.
