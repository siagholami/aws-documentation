To create a file system from an existing backup


Open the Amazon FSx console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/.


From the navigation list at right, choose Backups.


From the table on the dashboard, choose the backup that you want to use for creating a new file system.
Note
You can only restore your backup to a file system of the same storage capacity as the original. You can increase your restored file system's storage capacity after it becomes available. For more information, see Managing Storage Capacity.


Choose Restore backup. This will begin the create file system wizard.


Choose the settings that you'd like to change for this new file system. The storage type is set to SSD by default, but you can change it to HDD under the following conditions:
    The file system deployment type is Multi-AZ or Single-AZ 2.
    The storage capacity is at least 2,000 GiB.


Choose Review summary to review your settings before creating the file system.


Choose Create file system.


You've now successfully created your new file system from an existing backup.
