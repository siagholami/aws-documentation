Step 2: Map Your File Share to an EC2 Instance Running Windows Server
You can now mount your Amazon FSx file system to your Microsoft Windowsâ€“based Amazon EC2 instance joined to your AWS Directory Service directory. The name of your file share is not the same as name of your file system.
To map a file share on an Amazon EC2 Windows instance using the GUI


Before you can mount a file share on a Windows instance, you must launch the EC2 instance and connect it to an AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory. To perform this action, choose one of the following procedures from the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide:
    Seamlessly Join a Windows EC2 Instance
    Manually Join a Windows Instance


Connect to your instance. For more information, see Connecting to Your Windows Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances.


Once connected, open File Explorer.


From the navigation pane, open the context (right-click) menu for Network and choose Map Network Drive.


Choose a drive letter of your choice for Drive.


For Folder, enter the file system DNS name and the share name. The default Amazon FSx share is called \share. You can find the DNS name in the Amazon FSx console, https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/, Windows File Server > Network & Security section, or in the response of CreateFileSystem or DescribeFileSystems API command.
    For a Single-AZ file system joined to an AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory, the DNS name looks like this:
fs-0123456789abcdef0.ad-domain.com
    For a Single-AZ file system joined to a self-managed AD, and any Multi-AZ file system, the DNS name looks like this:
amznfsxaa11bb22.ad-domain.com


For example, enter \\fs-0123456789abcdef0.ad-domain.com\share.

Choose whether the file share should Reconnect at sign-in and then choose Finish.
