Step 3: Write Data to Your File Share
Now that you've mapped your file share to your instance, you can use your file share like any other directory in your Windows environment.
To write data to your file share


Open the Notepad text editor.


Write some content in the text editor. For example: Hello, World!


Save the file to your file share's drive letter.


Using File Explorer, navigate to your file share and find the text file that you just saved.
