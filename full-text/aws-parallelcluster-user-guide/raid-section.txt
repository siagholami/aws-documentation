 ebs_kms_key_id
Defines configuration settings for a RAID array that is built from a number of identical Amazon EBS volumes. The RAID drive is mounted on the head node and is exported to compute nodes via NFS.
The format is [raid raid-name]. raid-name must start with a letter, contain no more than 30 characters, and only contain letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
[raid rs]
shared_dir = raid
raid_type = 1
num_of_raid_volumes = 2
encrypted = true
shared_dir
Defines the mount point for the RAID array on the head and compute nodes.
The RAID drive is created only if this parameter is specified.
Do not use NONE or /NONE as the shared directory.
The following example mounts the array at /raid.
shared_dir = raid
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
raid_type
Defines the RAID type for the RAID array.
The RAID drive is created only if this parameter is specified.
Valid options are:
 0
 1
For more information on RAID types, see RAID info in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
The following example creates a RAID 0 array:
raid_type = 0
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
num_of_raid_volumes
Defines the number of Amazon EBS volumes to assemble the RAID array from.
Minimum number of volumes = 2.
Maximum number of volumes = 5.
The default value is 2.
num_of_raid_volumes = 2
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
volume_type
Defines the type of volume to build.
Valid options are:
 gp2
 io1
 st1
 sc1
For more information, see Amazon EBS volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
The default value is gp2.
volume_type = io1
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
volume_size
Defines the size of the volume to be created, in GiB.
The default value is 20.
volume_size = 20
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
volume_iops
Defines the number of IOPS for io1 type volumes.
The default value is 100.
volume_iops = 500
Update policy: This setting can be changed during an update.
encrypted
Specifies whether the file system is encrypted.
The default value is false.
encrypted = false
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
ebs_kms_key_id
Specifies a custom AWS KMS key to use for encryption.
This parameter must be used together with encrypted = true, and it must have a custom ec2_iam_role.
For more information, see Disk encryption with a custom KMS Key.
ebs_kms_key_id = xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
