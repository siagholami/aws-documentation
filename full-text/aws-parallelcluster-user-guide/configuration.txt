 Example
By default, AWS ParallelCluster uses the file ~/.parallelcluster/config for all configuration parameters. You can specify a custom configuration file by using the -c or --config command line option or the AWS_PCLUSTER_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.
An example configuration file is installed with AWS ParallelCluster in the Python directory at site-packages/aws-parallelcluster/examples/config. The example configuration file is also available on GitHub, at https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster/blob/v2.9.1/cli/pcluster/examples/config.
Layout
An AWS ParallelCluster configuration is defined in multiple sections.
The following sections are required: [global] section and [aws] section.
You also must include at least one [cluster] section and one [vpc] section.
A section starts with the section name in brackets, followed by parameters and configuration.
