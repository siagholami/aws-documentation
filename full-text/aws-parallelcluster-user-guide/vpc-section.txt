 vpc_id
 vpc_security_group_id
Specifies Amazon VPC configuration settings.
The format is [vpc vpc-name]. vpc-name must start with a letter, contain no more than 30 characters, and only contain letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
[vpc public]
vpc_id = vpc-xxxxxx
master_subnet_id = subnet-xxxxxx
additional_sg
Provides an additional Amazon VPC security group Id for all instances.
The default value is NONE.
additional_sg = sg-xxxxxx
compute_subnet_cidr
Specifies a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block. Use this parameter if you want AWS ParallelCluster to create a compute subnet.
compute_subnet_cidr = 10.0.100.0/24
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
compute_subnet_id
Specifies the ID of an existing subnet in which to provision the compute nodes.
If not specified, compute_subnet_id uses the valueof master_subnet_id.
If the subnet is private, you must set up NAT for web access.
compute_subnet_id = subnet-xxxxxx
Update policy: The compute fleet must be stopped for this setting to be changed for an update.
master_subnet_id
Specifies the ID of an existing subnet in which to provision the head node.
master_subnet_id = subnet-xxxxxx
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
ssh_from
Specifies a CIDR-formatted IP range to allow SSH access from.
This parameter is used only when AWS ParallelCluster creates the security group.
The default value is 0.0.0.0/0.
ssh_from = 0.0.0.0/0
Update policy: This setting can be changed during an update.
use_public_ips
Defines whether to assign public IP addresses to compute instances.
If set to true, an Elastic IP address is associated to the head node.
If set to false, the head node has a public IP (or not) according to the value of the "Auto-assign Public IP" subnet configuration parameter.
For examples, see networking configuration.
The default value is true.
use_public_ips = true
Important
By default, all AWS accounts are limited to five (5) Elastic IP addresses per Region. For more information, see Elastic IP address limit in Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Update policy: The compute fleet must be stopped for this setting to be changed for an update.
vpc_id
Specifies the ID of the Amazon VPC in which to provision the cluster.
vpc_id = vpc-xxxxxx
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
vpc_security_group_id
Specifies the use of an existing security group for all instances.
The default value is NONE.
vpc_security_group_id = sg-xxxxxx
The security group created by AWS ParallelCluster allows SSH access using port 22 from the addresses specified in the ssh_from setting, or all IPv4 addresses (0.0.0.0/0) if the ssh_from setting isn't specified. If NICE DCV is enabled, then the security group allows access to NICE DCV using port 8443 (or whatever the port setting specifies) from the addresses specified in the access_from setting, or all IPv4 addresses (0.0.0.0/0) if the access_from setting isn't specified.
Update policy: This setting can be changed during an update.
