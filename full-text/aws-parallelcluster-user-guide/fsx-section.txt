Defines configuration settings for an attached Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. For more information about Amazon FSx for Lustre, see Amazon FSx CreateFileSystem.
Amazon FSx for Lustre is supported if the base_os is alinux, alinux2, centos7, ubuntu1604, or ubuntu1804.
When using Amazon Linux, the kernel must be >= 4.14.104-78.84.amzn1.x86_64. For detailed instructions, see Installing the lustre client in the Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide.
Note
Amazon FSx for Lustre is not currently supported when using awsbatch as a scheduler.
Note
Support for Amazon FSx for Lustre on alinux2, ubuntu1604, and ubuntu1804 was added in AWS ParallelCluster version 2.6.0. Support for Amazon FSx for Lustre on centos7 was added in AWS ParallelCluster version 2.4.0.
If using an existing file system, it must be associated to a security group that allows inbound TCP traffic to port 988. Setting the source to 0.0.0.0/0 on a security group rule provides client access from all IP ranges within your VPC security group for the protocol and port range for that rule. To further limit access to your file systems we recommend using more restrictive sources for your security group rules, for example more specific CIDR ranges, IP addresses, or security group IDs. This is done automatically when not using vpc_security_group_id.
To use an existing Amazon FSx file system, specify fsx_fs_id.
The format is [fsx fsx-name]. fsx-name must start with a letter, contain no more than 30 characters, and only contain letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
[fsx fs]
shared_dir = /fsx
fsx_fs_id = fs-073c3803dca3e28a6
To create and configure a new file system, use the following parameters:
[fsx fs]
shared_dir = /fsx
storage_capacity = 3600
imported_file_chunk_size = 1024
export_path = s3://bucket/folder
import_path = s3://bucket
weekly_maintenance_start_time = 1:00:00
automatic_backup_retention_days
(Optional) Specifies the number of days to retain automatic backups. This is only valid for use with PERSISTENT_1 deployment types. When the automatic_backup_retention_days parameter is specified, the export_path, import_path, and imported_file_chunk_size parameters must not be specified. This corresponds to the AutomaticBackupRetentionDays property.
The default value is 0. This setting disables automatic backups. The possible values are integers between 0 and 35, inclusive.
automatic_backup_retention_days = 35
Note
Support for automatic_backup_retention_days was added in AWS ParallelCluster version 2.8.0.
Update policy: This setting can be changed during an update.
copy_tags_to_backups
(Optional) Specifies whether tags for the filesystem are copied to the backups. This is only valid for use with PERSISTENT_1 deployment types. When the copy_tags_to_backups parameter is specified, the automatic_backup_retention_days must be specified with a value greater than 0, and the export_path, import_path, and imported_file_chunk_size parameters must not be specified. This corresponds to the CopyTagsToBackups property.
The default value is false.
copy_tags_to_backups = true
Note
Support for copy_tags_to_backups was added in AWS ParallelCluster version 2.8.0.

Support for deployment_type was added in AWS ParallelCluster version 2.6.0.
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
export_path
(Optional) Specifies the Amazon S3 path where the root of your file system is exported. The path must be in the same Amazon S3 bucket as the import_path parameter. When the export_path parameter is specified, the automatic_backup_retention_days, copy_tags_to_backups, daily_automatic_backup_start_time, and fsx_backup_id parameters must not be specified. This corresponds to the ExportPath property.
The default value is s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp], where import-bucket is the bucket provided in the import_path parameter.
export_path = s3://bucket/folder
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
fsx_backup_id
(Optional) Specifies the ID of the backup to use for restoring the file system from an existing backup. When the fsx_backup_id parameter is specified, the deployment_type, export_path, fsx_kms_key_id, import_path, imported_file_chunk_size, storage_capacity, and per_unit_storage_throughput parameters must not be specified. These parameters are read from the backup. Additionally, the export_path, import_path, and imported_file_chunk_size parameters must not be specified.
This corresponds to the BackupId property.
fsx_backup_id = backup-fedcba98
Note
Support for fsx_backup_id was added in AWS ParallelCluster version 2.8.0.

import_path
(Optional) Specifies the S3 bucket to load data from into the file system and serve as the export bucket. For more information, see export_path. If you specify the import_path parameter, the automatic_backup_retention_days, copy_tags_to_backups, daily_automatic_backup_start_time, and fsx_backup_id parameters must not be specified. This corresponds to the ImportPath parameter in the Amazon FSx API Reference.
Import occurs on cluster creation. For more information, see Importing data from your Amazon S3 bucket in the Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide.
If a value is not provided, the file system is empty.
import_path =  s3://bucket
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
imported_file_chunk_size
(Optional) Determines the stripe count and the maximum amount of data per file (in MiB) stored on a single physical disk for files that are imported from a data repository (using import_path). The maximum number of disks that a single file can be striped across is limited by the total number of disks that make up the file system. When the imported_file_chunk_size parameter is specified, the automatic_backup_retention_days, copy_tags_to_backups, daily_automatic_backup_start_time, and fsx_backup_id parameters must not be specified. This corresponds to the ImportedFileChunkSize property.
The chunk size default is 1024 (1 GiB), and it can go as high as 512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.
imported_file_chunk_size = 1024
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
per_unit_storage_throughput
(Required for PERSISTENT_1 deployment types) For the deployment_type= PERSISTENT_1 deployment type, describes the amount of read and write throughput for each 1 tebibyte (TiB) of storage, in MB/s/TiB. File system throughput capacity is calculated by multiplying ﬁle system storage capacity (TiB) by the per_unit_storage_throughput (MB/s/TiB). For a 2.4 TiB ﬁle system, provisioning 50 MB/s/TiB of per_unit_storage_throughput yields 120 MB/s of ﬁle system throughput. You pay for the amount of throughput that you provision. This corresponds to the PerUnitStorageThroughput property.
The possible values are 50, 100, 200.
per_unit_storage_throughput = 200
Note
Support for per_unit_storage_throughput was added in AWS ParallelCluster version 2.6.0.
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
shared_dir
(Required) Defines the mount point for the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system on the head and compute nodes.

The following example mounts the file system at /fsx.
shared_dir = /fsx
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
storage_capacity
(Required) Specifies the storage capacity of the file system, in GiB. This corresponds to the StorageCapacity property.
The storage capacity possible values vary based on the deployment_type setting.
SCRATCH_1
The possible values are 1200, 2400, and any multiple of 3600.
SCRATCH_2 and PERSISTENT_1
The possible values are 1200 and any multiple of 2400.
storage_capacity = 7200
Note
For AWS ParallelCluster version 2.5.0 and 2.5.1, storage_capacity supported possible values of 1200, 2400, and any multiple of 3600. For versions earlier than AWS ParallelCluster version 2.5.0, storage_capacity had a minimum size of 3600.
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
weekly_maintenance_start_time
(Optional) Specifies a preferred time to perform weekly maintenance, in the UTC time zone. This corresponds to the WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime property.
The format is [day of week]:[hour of day]:[minute of hour]. For example, Monday at Midnight is:
