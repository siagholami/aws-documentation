Install AWS ParallelCluster on macOS
Topics
 Prerequisites
 Install AWS ParallelCluster on macOS using pip
 Add the AWS ParallelCluster executable to your command line path
Prerequisites

Python 3 version 3.6 or Python 2 version 2.7

Check your Python installation.
$ python --version
If your computer doesn't already have Python installed, or if you want to install a different version of Python, follow the procedure in Install AWS ParallelCluster on Linux.
Install AWS ParallelCluster on macOS using pip
You can also use pip directly to install AWS ParallelCluster. If you don't have pip, follow the instructions in the main installation topic. Run pip3 --version to see if your version of macOS already includes Python and pip3.
$ pip3 --version
To install AWS ParallelCluster on macOS


Download and install the latest version of Python from the downloads page of Python.org.


Download and run the pip3 installation script provided by the Python Packaging Authority.


$ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
   $ python3 get-pip.py --user

Use your newly installed pip3 to install AWS ParallelCluster. We recommend that if you use Python version 3, you use the pip3 command.

$ python3 -m pip install aws-parallelcluster --upgrade --user

Verify that AWS ParallelCluster is installed correctly.

$ pcluster version
   2.9.1
If the program isn't found, add it to your command line path.
To upgrade to the latest version, run the installation command again.
$ pip3 install aws-parallelcluster --upgrade --user
Add the AWS ParallelCluster executable to your command line path
After installing with pip, you might need to add the pcluster program to your operating system's PATH environment variable. The location of the program depends on where Python is installed.
Example AWS ParallelCluster install location - macOS with Python 3.6 and pip (user mode) 
~/Library/Python/3.6/bin
Substitute the version of Python that you have for the version in the preceding example.
If you don't know where Python is installed, run which python.
$ which python3
/usr/local/bin/python3
The output might be the path to a symlink, not the path to the actual program. Run ls -al to see where it points.
$ ls -al /usr/local/bin/python3
lrwxr-xr-x  1 username  admin  36 Mar 12 12:47 /usr/local/bin/python3 -> ../Cellar/python/3.6.8/bin/python3
pip installs programs in the same folder that contains the Python application. Add this folder to your PATH variable.
To modify your PATH variable (Linux, macOS, or Unix)

Find your shell's profile script in your user folder. If you're not sure which shell you have, run echo $SHELL.

$ ls -a ~
   .  ..  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  Desktop  Documents  Downloads
    Bash – .bash_profile, .profile, or .bash_login
    Zsh – .zshrc
    Tcsh – .tcshrc, .cshrc, or .login

Add an export command to your profile script.

export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
This command adds a path, ~/.local/bin in this example, to the current PATH variable.

Load the profile into your current session.

$ source ~/.bash_profile
