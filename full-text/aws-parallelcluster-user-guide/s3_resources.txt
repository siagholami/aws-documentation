Working with Amazon S3
You can access Amazon S3 from within AWS ParallelCluster. You control the access to Amazon S3 through two parameters in the AWS ParallelCluster configuration.
```
Specify Amazon S3 resource which AWS ParallelCluster nodes will be granted read-only access
(defaults to NONE)
s3_read_resource = NONE
Specify Amazon S3 resource which AWS ParallelCluster nodes will be granted read-write access
(defaults to NONE)
s3_read_write_resource = NONE
```
Both parameters accept either * or a valid Amazon S3 ARN. For details about specifying Amazon S3 ARNs, see Amazon S3 ARN format in the AWS General Reference
Examples
The following example gives you read access to any object in the Amazon S3 bucket my_corporate_bucket.
s3_read_resource = arn:aws:s3:::my_corporate_bucket/*
This following example gives you read access to the bucket, but does not let you read items from the bucket.
s3_read_resource = arn:aws:s3:::my_corporate_bucket
This last example gives you read access to the bucket and to the items stored in the bucket..
s3_read_resource = arn:aws:s3:::my_corporate_bucket*
