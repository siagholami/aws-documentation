Managing Indices
After you add data to Amazon Elasticsearch Service, you often need to reindex that data, work with index aliases, move an index to more cost-effective storage, or delete it altogether. This chapter covers UltraWarm storage and Index State Management. For information on the Elasticsearch index APIs, see the Open Distro for Elasticsearch documentation.
