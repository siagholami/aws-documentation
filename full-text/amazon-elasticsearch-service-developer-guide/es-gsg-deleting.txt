Step 4: Delete an Amazon ES Domain
Because the movies domain from this tutorial is for test purposes, you should delete it when you are finished experimenting to avoid incurring charges.
To delete an Amazon ES domain (console)


Sign in to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service console.


In the navigation pane, under My domains, choose the movies domain.


Choose Actions, Delete domain.


Select the Delete the domain check box, and then choose Delete.
