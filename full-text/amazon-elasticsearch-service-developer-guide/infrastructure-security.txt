Infrastructure Security in Amazon Elasticsearch Service
As a managed service, Amazon Elasticsearch Service is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes whitepaper.
You use AWS published API calls to access the Amazon ES configuration API through the network. Clients must support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 or later. We recommend TLS 1.2 or later. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.
Additionally, requests to the configuration API must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal. Or you can use the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests.
Depending on your domain configuration, you might also need to sign requests to the Elasticsearch APIs. For more information, see Making and Signing Amazon ES Requests.
Amazon ES supports public access domains, which can receive requests from any internet-connected device, and VPC access domains, which are isolated from the public internet.
