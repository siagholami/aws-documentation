Setting Up the Upstream System
You must set up your upstream system before you start working in AWS Elemental MediaLive. 
Important
Typically, you set up the MediaLive channel as a standard channel. The procedures in this section assume that you have decided to set up in this way. The procedures therefore describe how to set up the upstream system to provide two sources. 
If you have decided to set up a single-pipeline channel, then follow these procedures, but set up the upstream system to provide only one source.
