Enabling Decoration â€“ HLS
Manifest decoration is enabled at the output group level, which means that the manifests for all outputs in that group include instructions based on the SCTE-35 content.
To enable decoration


In the channel that you are creating, make sure that you have set the ad avail mode. See Getting Ready: Set the Ad Avail Mode.


In the navigation pane, find the desired HLS output group. 


In Ad Marker, choose Add ad markers. 


For HLS ad markers, select the type of ad marker. For information about the different types of markers, see Sample Manifests - HLS. 


Repeat to add more types of markers, as desired.


The manifest for each output will include a separate set of tags for each type that you select.
