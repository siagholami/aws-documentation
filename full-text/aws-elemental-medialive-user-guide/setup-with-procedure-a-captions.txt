Setup with Embedded or Object-style Captions
This example shows how to implement [the fourth use case](use-case-one-input-format-to-one-output-format-not-converted.md) from the typical scenarios. For example, you want to produce an HLS output with three video encodes (one for low-resolution video, one for medium, one for high) and one audio. You also want to include embedded captions (in English and Spanish) and associate them with all three video encodes.

To set up for this use case


In the channel that you are creating, in the navigation pane, in Input attachments, choose the input. 


For General input settings, choose Add captions selector to create one captions selector. Set Selector settings to Embedded source.


Create an HLS output group.


Create one output and set up the video and audio for low-resolution video.


In that same output, create one captions asset with the following:
    Captions selector name: Captions selector 1.
    Captions settings: One of the Embedded formats. 
    Language code and Language description: Leave blank; with embedded passthrough captions, all the languages are included.


Create a second output and set up the video and audio for medium-resolution video.


In that same output, create one captions asset with the following:
    Captions selector name: Captions selector 1.
    Captions settings: One of the Embedded formats. 
    Language code and Language description: Keep blank. With embedded captions, all the languages are included.


Create a third output and set up the video and audio for high-resolution video.


In that same output, create one captions asset with the following:
    Captions selector name: Captions selector 1.
    Captions settings: One of the Embedded formats. 
    Language code and Language description: Keep blank. With embedded captions, all the languages are included.


Finish setting up the channel and save it.
