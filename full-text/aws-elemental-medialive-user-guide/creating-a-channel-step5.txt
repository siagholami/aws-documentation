Step 6: Create Outputs
Every output group contains one or more outputs. Each output contains the individual video, audio, and captions encodes and configuration information for the type of output. For example, it contains configuration information that is specific to an HLS output.
This section describes how to create and configure the outputs and assumes that you have created the output group. 
To create an output in any output group


On the Create channel page, in the Output groups section, the Output section by default has one output. If you need to create more outputs (as determined when you planned the channel), then choose Add Output as many times as required. A new output line is added.


Choose the Settings link beside the first output line. The content pane shows the fields for that output. 


The pane for all output types shows two sections: Output settings and Stream settings. 


Complete both the Output settings and Stream settings for the output type: Settings for an Archive Output, Settings for an HLS Output, Settings for a Microsoft Smooth Output, or Settings for a UDP Output.


When you have finished with the fields for this output, go to the next output in this output group. After you set up all the outputs in the output group, go to the outputs in the next output group.


After you set up all outputs, go to the next step.
