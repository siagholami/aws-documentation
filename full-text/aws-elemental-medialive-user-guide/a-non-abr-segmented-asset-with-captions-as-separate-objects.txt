Non-ABR Segmented Asset with Captions as Separate Objects
In this example, captions are separate objects, but they are contained within the media asset (they are not sidecar files). Captions such as DVB-Sub are set up as separate objects.

Running this channel produces one segmented media file that contains the video, audio, and captions encodes.
