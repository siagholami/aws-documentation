Starting, Stopping, and Pausing an AWS Elemental MediaLive Channel
After you create a channel, you can start it. The channel never starts automatically except when it is already running and attempts to recover from a failure.
You can stop a running channel at any time. 
You can also pause one or both the pipelines in a channel by adding a Pause action to the schedule for the channel. For more information, see Types of Schedule Actions for Pause.
For information about charges when a channel is running, see Pricing.
