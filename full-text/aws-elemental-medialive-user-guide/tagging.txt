Tagging AWS Elemental MediaLive Resources
A tag is a metadata label that you assign or that AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value. For tags that you assign, you define the key and value. For example, you might define the key as stage and the value for one resource as test.
Tags help you do the following:
 Identify and organize your AWS resources. Many AWS services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you could assign the same tag to an AWS Elemental MediaLive channel and an endpoint that you assign to an AWS Elemental MediaTailor configuration.
 Track your AWS costs. You activate these tags on the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard. AWS uses the tags to categorize your costs and deliver a monthly cost allocation report to you. For more information, see Use Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
For tips on using tags, see the AWS Tagging Strategies post on the AWS Answers blog.

Managing Tags
Tags are made up of the Key and Value properties on a resource. 
You can use the AWS Management Console to manage tags. You can also use the AWS Elemental MediaLive console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS Elemental MediaLive API to add, edit, or delete the values for these properties. 
Tagging Using the AWS Management Console
We recommend that you manage tags by using the Tag Editor on the AWS Management Console. The Tag Editor provides a central, unified way to create and manage your tags. The Tag Editor provides the best results, including consistency between tags within MediaLive and between MediaLive and other services. 
For more information, see Working with Tag Editor in Getting Started with the AWS Management Console.
