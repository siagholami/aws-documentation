Getting Ready: Set the Ad Avail Mode
You must set the Ad Avail mode to notify MediaLive of the ID type of SCTE-35 messages that the input is using to indicate ad avail events.
Follow this procedure if you want to support one or more of the following features:
 Manifest decoration
 Ad avail blanking
If your processing does not involve at least one of these features, the ad avail mode is ignored.
To set the ad avail mode


In the channel that you are creating, in the navigation pane, choose General settings. 


Choose Avail configuration.


Set the Avail settings: 
    SCTE-35 splice insert (default): Select this mode if the input uses splice inserts to indicate ad avails. The input might also contain messages for others events such as chapters or programs. 
    SCTE-35 time signal apos: Select this mode if the input contains time signals of segmentation type Placement opportunity. The input might also contain messages for other events such as chapters or programs. 


The mode identifies which of all possible events are treated as triggers for ad avails and as triggers for blackouts. In turn, these triggers affect how manifests are decorated, when video is blanked, and when video is blacked out. 


In Ad avail offset, set a value, if desired. See the help for this field.


Leave web_delivery_allowed_flag and no_regional_blackout_flag as Follow for now. For information about these fields, see Ad Avail Blanking Restriction Flags.
