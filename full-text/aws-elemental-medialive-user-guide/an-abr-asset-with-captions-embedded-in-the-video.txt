ABR Asset with Captions Embedded in the Video
For an ABR asset, you create the following outputs and encodes:
 Several video outputs, each containing one video encode (for example, one high-bitrate video, one medium-bitrate video, and one low-bitrate video) and the same embedded captions encode.
 One or more audio encodes (for example, one for each language).
The following illustration shows an example configuration.

Running this channel produces five sets of segmented media files, one set for each video output and each audio output.

In outputs that have manifests, it also produces one master manifest and five variant manifests.
