The following changes are not supported.
 Switch to a different deployment target (for example, deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk instead of AWS CodeDeploy).
 Add a friendly web endpoint name.
 Change the CodeCommit repository name (for an AWS CodeStar project connected to CodeCommit).
 For an AWS CodeStar project connected to GitHub, disconnect the GitHub repository, and then reconnect the repository to that project, or connect any other repository to that project. You can use the CodePipeline console (not the AWS CodeStar console) to disconnect and reconnect to GitHub in a pipeline's Source stage. However, if you reconnect the Source stage to a different GitHub repository, in the AWS CodeStar dashboard for the project, the information in the Application endpoints, Commit history, and GitHub Issues tiles might be wrong or out of date. Disconnecting the GitHub repository does not remove that repository's information from the commit history and GitHub issues tiles in the AWS CodeStar project dashboard. To remove this information, use the GitHub website to disable access to GitHub from the AWS CodeStar project. To revoke access, on the GitHub website, use the Authorized OAuth Apps section of the settings page for your GitHub account profile.
 Disconnect the CodeCommit repository (for an AWS CodeStar project connected to CodeCommit) and then reconnect the repository to that project, or connect any other repository to that project.
