Change an AWS Lambda Function in Source Code
You can change the code or settings of a Lambda function, or its IAM role or API Gateway API, that AWS CodeStar creates in a project. To do this, we recommend that you use the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) along with the template.yaml file in your project's CodeCommit repository. This template.yaml file defines your function's name, handler, runtime, IAM role, and API in API Gateway. For more information, see How to Create Serverless Applications Using AWS SAM on the GitHub website.
