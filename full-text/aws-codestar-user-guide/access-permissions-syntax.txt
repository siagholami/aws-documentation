Action and Resource Syntax
The following sections describe the format for specifying actions and resources.
Actions follow this general format:
codestar:action
Where action is an available AWS CodeStar operation, such as ListProjects or AssociateResource. To allow an action, use the "Effect" : "Allow" clause. To explicitly deny an action, use the "Effect" : "Deny" clause. By default, all actions are denied, unless specified otherwise in any other attached policy. 
Resources follow this general format:
arn:aws:codestar:region:account:resource-specifier
Where region is a target AWS Region (such as us-east-2), account is the AWS account ID, and resource-specifier is the project ID. Wildcard (*) characters can be used to specify a partial name.
For example, the following specifies the AWS CodeStar project named my-first-projec registered to the AWS account 111111111111 in the AWS Region us-east-2:
arn:aws:codestar:us-east-2:111111111111:project/my-first-projec
The following specifies any AWS CodeStar project that begins with the name my-proj registered to the AWS account 111111111111 in the AWS Region us-east-2:
arn:aws:codestar:us-east-2:111111111111:project/my-proj*

Resource Scoping in AWS CodeStar
Some of the permissions in AWS CodeStar cannot be scoped to a resource, but instead must be scoped to all, or the action fails. 
The following action cannot be scoped. It must be set to *:
 ListProjects
Projects
Allowed actions include: 
 CreateProject to create an AWS CodeStar project. 
 DeleteProject to delete an AWS CodeStar project.
 DescribeProject to describe the attributes of an AWS CodeStar project.
 ListProjects to list all the AWS CodeStar projects. 
 UpdateProject to update the attributes of an AWS CodeStar project.
The following example allows a specified IAM user to edit the attributes of an AWS CodeStar project, such as its project description:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : [
        "codestar:UpdateProject"
      ],
      "Resource" : "arn:aws:codestar:us-east-2:project/my-first-projec"
    }
  ]
}
Resources
Allowed actions include:
 ListResources to list all the resources for an AWS CodeStar project.
The following example allows an IAM user who has this policy attached to list resources for a project with the ID my-first-projec:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : [
        "codestar:ListResources",
      ],
      "Resource" : "arn:aws:codestar:us-east-2:project/my-first-projec"
    }
  ]
}
Teams
Allowed actions include:
 AssociateTeamMember to add a user to an AWS CodeStar project.
 DisassociateTeamMember to remove a user from an AWS CodeStar project.
 ListTeamMembers to list all the users in an AWS CodeStar project.
 UpdateTeamMember to change the team member's attributes in an AWS CodeStar project (for example, the user's project role). 
The following example allows an IAM user who has this policy attached to add team members to an AWS CodeStar project with the project ID my-first-projec, but explicitly denies that user the ability to remove team members:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : [
        "codestar:AssociateTeamMember",
      ],
      "Resource" : "arn:aws:codestar:us-east-2:project/my-first-projec"
    },
    {
      "Effect" : "Deny",
      "Action" : [
        "codestar:DisassociateTeamMember",
      ],
      "Resource" : "arn:aws:codestar:us-east-2:project/my-first-projec"
    }
      ]
]
}
```
Users
Allowed actions include:
 CreateUserProfile to create a user profile in AWS CodeStar. This profile contains data associated with the user, such as a display name, that appears across all AWS CodeStar projects.
 DeleteUserProfile to delete an AWS CodeStar user profile.
 DescribeUserProfile to retrieve information about an AWS CodeStar user profile.
 ListUserProfiles to list all AWS CodeStar user profiles for an AWS account.
 UpdateUserProfile to update an AWS CodeStar profile for a user.
The following example allows an IAM user who has this policy attached to list all AWS CodeStar user profiles associated with an AWS account:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : [
        "codestar:ListUserProfiles",
              ],
      "Resource" : "*"
    }
  ]
}
