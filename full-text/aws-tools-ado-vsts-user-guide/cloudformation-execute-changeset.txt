AWS CloudFormation Execute Change Set task
Synopsis
Executes an AWS CloudFormation change set to create or update a stack.
Description
When you execute a change set, AWS CloudFormation deletes all other change sets associated with the stack because they aren't valid for the updated stack.
AWS CloudFormation updates a stack using the input information that was provided when the specified change set was created.
If a stack policy is associated with the stack, AWS CloudFormation enforces the policy during the update. You can't specify a temporary stack policy that overrides the current policy.
Parameters
You can set the following parameters for the task. Required parameters are noted by an asterisk (*). Other parameters are optional.
Display name*
The default name of the task instance, which can be modified: Execute Change Set
AWS Credentials
Specifies the AWS credentials to be used by the task in the build agent environment.
You can specify credentials using a service endpoint (of type AWS) in the task configuration or you can leave unspecified. If unspecified the task will attempt to obtain credentials from the following sources in order:
 From task variables named AWS.AccessKeyID, AWS.SecretAccessKey and optionally AWS.SessionToken.
 From credentials set in environment variables in the build agent process. When using environment variables in the build agent process you may use the standard AWS environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and optionally AWS_SESSION_TOKEN.
 If the build agent is running on an Amazon EC2 instance, from the instance metadata associated with the EC2 instance. For credentials to be available from EC2 instance metadata the instance must have been started with an instance profile referencing a role granting permissions to the task to make calls to AWS on your behalf. For more information, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances.
AWS Region
The AWS Region code (for example, us-east-1, us-west-2) of the Region containing the AWS resources the task will use or create. For more information, see Regions and endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
If a Region is not specified in the task configuration the task will attempt to obtain the Region to be used using the standard AWS environment variable AWS_REGION in the build agent process's environment. Tasks running in build agents hosted on Amazon EC2 instances (Windows or Linux) will also attempt to obtain the Region using the instance metadata associated with the EC2 instance if no Region is configured on the task or set in the environment variable.
Note: The Regions listed in the picker are those known at the time this software was released. New Regions that are not listed may still be used by entering the region code of the Region (for example, us_west_2).
Change Set Name*
The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the change set that you want to execute.
Stack Name
The stack name or ARN of the stack associated with the change set. This value is required if you specify the name of a change set to execute. If the ARN of the change set ARN is specified this field is optional.
The name must be unique in the region in which you are creating the stack. A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case-sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and cannot be longer than 128 characters.
Output Variable
The name of the variable that will contain the ID of the stack on task completion. The variable can be used as $(variableName) to refer to the stack ID in subsequent tasks.
Task Permissions
This task requires permissions to call the following AWS service APIs (depending on selected task options, not all APIs may be used):
 cloudformation:DescribeStacks
 cloudformation:DescribeChangeSet
 cloudformation:DescribeStackResources
 cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSet
