Amazon ECR Push task
(Amazon Elastic Container Registry Push Image Task)
Synopsis
Pushes a Docker image identified by name, with optional tag, or image ID to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
Description
This task pushes a Docker image to the Elastic Container Registry. The image to push can be identified using its image ID or by name, with optional tag suffix. The task handles the work of appropriately tagging the image as required by ECR and also the login process to your registry prior to executing the Docker Push command.
Parameters
You can set the following parameters for the task. Required parameters are noted by an asterisk (*). Other parameters are optional.
Display name*
The default name of the task instance, which can be modified: Push Image
AWS Credentials
Specifies the AWS credentials to be used by the task in the build agent environment.
You can specify credentials using a service endpoint (of type AWS) in the task configuration or you can leave unspecified. If unspecified the task will attempt to obtain credentials from the following sources in order:
 From task variables named AWS.AccessKeyID, AWS.SecretAccessKey and optionally AWS.SessionToken.
 From credentials set in environment variables in the build agent process. When using environment variables in the build agent process you may use the standard AWS environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and optionally AWS_SESSION_TOKEN.
 If the build agent is running on an Amazon EC2 instance, from the instance metadata associated with the EC2 instance. For credentials to be available from EC2 instance metadata the instance must have been started with an instance profile referencing a role granting permissions to the task to make calls to AWS on your behalf. For more information, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances.
AWS Region
The AWS Region code (for example, us-east-1, us-west-2) of the Region containing the AWS resources the task will use or create. For more information, see Regions and endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
If a Region is not specified in the task configuration the task will attempt to obtain the Region to be used using the standard AWS environment variable AWS_REGION in the build agent process's environment. Tasks running in build agents hosted on Amazon EC2 instances (Windows or Linux) will also attempt to obtain the Region using the instance metadata associated with the EC2 instance if no Region is configured on the task or set in the environment variable.
Note: The Regions listed in the picker are those known at the time this software was released. New Regions that are not listed may still be used by entering the region code of the Region (for example, us_west_2).
Image Identity*
How the image to be pushed is identified. You can select from either the image ID or the image name. If image name is selected a tag can also be specified.
Source Image Name
The name of the image to push. Required if Image Identity is set to Image name with optional tag.
Source Image Tag
Optional tag that can be suffixed to the image name. If a tag is not specified, 'latest' is assumed.
Source Image ID
The ID of the image to push. Required if Image Identity is set to Image ID.
Target Repository Name*
The name of the repository to which the image will be pushed.
Target Repository Tag
Optional tag for the new image in the repository. If not specified, ECR will assume 'latest'.
Create repository if it does not exist
If checked, the task will check to see if the repository exists and if it does not, will attempt to create it.
Image Tag Output Variable
The name of a build variable that will be created or updated with the pushed image reference. The image tag will be of the form aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/imagename, where imagename is in the format repositoryname[:tag]
