About minimum S3 Bucket permissions for SSM Agent
This topic provides information about the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets that SSM Agent might need to access to in order to perform Systems Manager operations. These buckets are publicly accessible, but in some cases, you might need to provide explicit permission in an EC2 instance profile for Systems Manager, or in a service role for instances in a hybrid environment. Most commonly, you must grant these permissions if you are using a private VPC endpoint in your Systems Manager operations. Otherwise, your resources can't access these public buckets.
To grant access to these buckets, you create a custom S3 permissions policy, and then attach it to your instance profile (for EC2 instances) or your service role (for on-premises servers and virtual machines (VMs) in a hybrid environment.
For SSM Agent updates, if the instance profile does not provide permissions to these buckets, the SSM Agent makes an HTTP call to download the update.
Note
These permissions only provide access to the AWS managed buckets required by SSM Agent. They don't provide the permissions that are necessary for other Amazon S3 operations. They also don't provide permission to your own S3 buckets.

Amazon S3 permissions required by SSM Agent



S3 bucket ARN
Description




arn:aws:s3:::aws-ssm-region/*
Provides access to the S3 bucket containing modules required for use with SSM documents.  In the Middle East (Bahrain) Region (me-south-1) only, this bucket uses a different naming convention. For this AWS Region only, use the following bucket instead.   aws-patch-manager-me-south-1-a53fc9dce


arn:aws:s3:::aws-windows-downloads-region/*
Required for some SSM documents that support Windows operating systems.


arn:aws:s3:::amazon-ssm-region/*
Required for updating SSM Agent installations. These buckets contain the SSM Agent installation packages, and the installation manifests that are referenced by the AWS-UpdateSSMAgent document and plugin. If these permissions are not provided, the SSM Agent makes an HTTP call to download the update.


arn:aws:s3:::amazon-ssm-packages-region/*
Required for using versions of SSM Agent prior to 2.2.45.0 to run the document AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage.


arn:aws:s3:::region-birdwatcher-prod/*
Provides access to the distribution service used by version 2.2.45.0 and later of SSM Agent. This service is used to run the document AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage.  This permission is needed for all AWS Regions except the Africa (Cape Town) Region (af-south-1) and the Europe (Milan) Region (eu-south-1).


arn:aws:s3:::aws-ssm-distributor-file-region/*
Provides access to the distribution service used by version 2.2.45.0 and later of SSM Agent. This service is used to run the document AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage.  This permission is needed only for the Africa (Cape Town) Region (af-south-1) and the Europe (Milan) Region (eu-south-1).


arn:aws:s3:::aws-ssm-document-attachments-region/*
Provides access to the S3 bucket containing the Distributor packages that are owned by Amazon.


arn:aws:s3:::patch-baseline-snapshot-region/*
Provides access to the S3 bucket containing patch baseline snapshots. This is required if you use the AWS-RunPatchBaseline SSM document or legacy AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline SSM document.  In the Middle East (Bahrain) Region (me-south-1) only, this bucket uses a different naming convention. For this AWS Region only, use the following bucket instead.   patch-baseline-snapshot-me-south-1-uduvl7q8



region represents the identifier for an AWS Region supported by AWS Systems Manager, such as us-east-2 for the US East (Ohio) Region. For a list of supported region values, see the Region column in Systems Manager service endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
Example
The following example illustrates how to provide access to the S3 buckets required for Systems Manager operations in the US East (Ohio) Region (us-east-2).
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::aws-ssm-us-east-2/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::aws-windows-downloads-us-east-2/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::amazon-ssm-us-east-2/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::amazon-ssm-packages-us-east-2/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::us-east-2-birdwatcher-prod/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::patch-baseline-snapshot-us-east-2/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
Important
We recommend that you avoid using wildcard characters (*) in place of specific Regions in this policy. For example, use arn:aws:s3:::aws-ssm-us-east-2/* and do not use arn:aws:s3:::aws-ssm-*/*. Using wildcards could provide access to S3 buckets that you donâ€™t intend to grant access to. If you want to use the instance profile for more than one Region, we recommend repeating the first Statement block for each Region.
