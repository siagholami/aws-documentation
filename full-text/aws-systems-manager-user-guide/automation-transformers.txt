Walkthrough: Using input transformers with Automation
This Systems Manager Automation walkthrough shows how to use the input transformer feature of Amazon EventBridge to extract the instance-id of an EC2 instance from an instance state change event. We use the input transformer to pass that data to the AWS-CreateImage Systems Manager Automation document target as the InstanceId input parameter. The rule is triggered when any instance changes to the stopped state.
For more information about working with input transformers, see Tutorial: Use Input Transformer to Customize What is Passed to the Event Target in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
Before You Begin
Verify that you added the required permissions and trust policy for EventBridge to your Systems Manager Automation service role. For more information, see Overview of Managing Access Permissions to Your EventBridge Resources in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
To use input transformers with Automation


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rules, and then choose Create rule.


-or-
If the Amazon EventBridge home page opens first, choose Create rule.

For Target, choose SSM Automation.


For Document, choose AWS-CreateImage.


Expand Configure automation parameter(s) and choose Input Transformer.


In the first box under Input Transformer, enter {"instance":"$.detail.instance-id"}.


In the second box, enter {"InstanceId":[]}.
