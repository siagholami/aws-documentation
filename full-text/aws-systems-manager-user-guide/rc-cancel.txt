Canceling a command
You can attempt to cancel a command as long as the service shows that it is in either a Pending or Executing state. However, even if a command is still in one of these states, we cannot guarantee that the command will be terminated and the underlying process stopped. 
To cancel a command using the console


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Run Command.


-or-
