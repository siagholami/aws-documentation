How patches are installed
Patch Manager uses the appropriate built-in mechanism for an operating system type to install updates on an instance. For example, on Windows Server, the Windows Update API is used, and on Amazon Linux the yum package manager is used.
Choose from the following tabs to learn how Patch Manager installs patches on an operating system.

[ Amazon Linux and Amazon Linux 2 ]
On Amazon Linux and Amazon Linux 2 instances, the patch installation workflow is as follows:


Apply GlobalFilters as specified in the patch baseline, keeping only the qualified packages for further processing. 


Apply ApprovalRules as specified in the patch baseline. Each approval rule can define a package as approved.


Approval rules, however, are also subject to whether the Include nonsecurity updates check box was selected when creating or last updating a patch baseline.
If nonsecurity updates are excluded, an implicit rule is applied in order to select only packages with upgrades in security repos. For each package, the candidate version of the package (which is typically the latest version) must be part of a security repo. 
If nonsecurity updates are included, patches from other repositories are considered as well.


Apply ApprovedPatches as specified in the patch baseline. The approved patches are approved for update even if they are discarded by GlobalFilters or if no approval rule specified in ApprovalRules grants it approval.


Apply RejectedPatches as specified in the patch baseline. The rejected patches are removed from the list of approved patches and will not be applied.


If multiple versions of a patch are approved, the latest version is applied.


The YUM update API is applied to approved patches as follows:
    For predefined default patch baselines provided by AWS, and for custom patch baselines where the Approved patches include non-security updates check box is not selected, only patches specified in updateinfo.xml are applied (security updates only).
The equivalent yum command for this workflow is:
sudo yum update-minimal --sec-severity=critical,important --bugfix -y
    For custom patch baselines where the Approved patches include non-security updates is selected, both patches in updateinfo.xml and those not in updateinfo.xml are applied (security and nonsecurity updates).
The equivalent yum command for this workflow is:
sudo yum update --security --bugfix


The instance is rebooted if any updates were installed. (Exception: If the RebootOption parameter is set to NoReboot in the AWS-RunPatchBaseline document, the instance is not rebooted after Patch Manager runs. For more information, see Parameter name: RebootOption.)



[ CentOS ]
On CentOS instances, the patch installation workflow is as follows:


Apply GlobalFilters as specified in the patch baseline, keeping only the qualified packages for further processing. 


Apply ApprovalRules as specified in the patch baseline. Each approval rule can define a package as approved.


Approval rules, however, are also subject to whether the Include nonsecurity updates check box was selected when creating or last updating a patch baseline.
If nonsecurity updates are excluded, an implicit rule is applied in order to select only packages with upgrades in security repos. For each package, the candidate version of the package (which is typically the latest version) must be part of a security repo. 
If nonsecurity updates are included, patches from other repositories are considered as well.


Apply ApprovedPatches as specified in the patch baseline. The approved patches are approved for update even if they are discarded by GlobalFilters or if no approval rule specified in ApprovalRules grants it approval.


Apply RejectedPatches as specified in the patch baseline. The rejected patches are removed from the list of approved patches and will not be applied.


If multiple versions of a patch are approved, the latest version is applied.


The YUM update API (on CentOS 6.x and 7.x versions) or the DNF update (on CentOS 8) is applied to approved patches.


The instance is rebooted if any updates were installed. (Exception: If the RebootOption parameter is set to NoReboot in the AWS-RunPatchBaseline document, the instance is not rebooted after Patch Manager runs. For more information, see Parameter name: RebootOption.)



[ Debian ]
On Debian instances, the patch installation workflow is as follows:


On Debian 8 only: Because some Debian 8.* instances refer to an obsolete package repository (jessie-backports), Patch Manager performs the following additional steps to ensure that patching operations succeed:


On your instance, the reference to the jessie-backports repository is commented out from the source location list (/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jessie-backports). As a result, no attempt is made to download patches from that location.


A Stretch security update signing key is imported. This key provides the necessary permissions for the update and install operations on Debian 8.* distributions.


An apt-get operation is run to ensure that the latest version of python3-apt is installed before the patching process begins.


After the installation process completes, the reference to the jessie-backports repository is restored and the signing key is removed from the apt sources keyring. This is done to leave the system configuration as it was before the patching operation. 


The next time Patch Manager updates the system, the same process is repeated.
The remaining steps in the patch installation workflow apply to both Debian 8 and 9.


Apply GlobalFilters as specified in the patch baseline, keeping only the qualified packages for further processing. 


Apply ApprovalRules as specified in the patch baseline. Each approval rule can define a package as approved. 
Note
Because it's not possible to reliably determine the release dates of update packages for Debian, the auto-approval options are not supported for this operating system.


Approval rules, however, are also subject to whether the Include nonsecurity updates check box was selected when creating or last updating a patch baseline.
If nonsecurity updates are excluded, an implicit rule is applied in order to select only packages with upgrades in security repos. For each package, the candidate version of the package (which is typically the latest version) must be part of a security repo. 
If nonsecurity updates are included, patches from other repositories are considered as well.
Note
For Debian, patch candidate versions are limited to patches included in debian-security.


Apply ApprovedPatches as specified in the patch baseline. The approved patches are approved for update even if they are discarded by GlobalFilters or if no approval rule specified in ApprovalRules grants it approval.


Apply RejectedPatches as specified in the patch baseline. The rejected patches are removed from the list of approved patches and will not be applied.


The APT library is used to upgrade packages.


The instance is rebooted if any updates were installed. (Exception: If the RebootOption parameter is set to NoReboot in the AWS-RunPatchBaseline document, the instance is not rebooted after Patch Manager runs. For more information, see Parameter name: RebootOption.)

The instance is rebooted if any updates were installed. (Exception: If the RebootOption parameter is set to NoReboot in the AWS-RunPatchBaseline document, the instance is not rebooted after Patch Manager runs. For more information, see Parameter name: RebootOption.)



[ Windows ]
When a patching operation is performed on a Windows Server instance, the instance requests a snapshot of the appropriate patch baseline from Systems Manager. This snapshot contains the list of all updates available in the patch baseline that have been approved for deployment. This list of updates is sent to the Windows Update API, which determines which of the updates are applicable to the instance and installs them as needed. If any updates are installed, the instance is rebooted afterwards, as many times as necessary to complete all necessary patching. (Exception: If the RebootOption parameter is set to NoReboot in the AWS-RunPatchBaseline document, the instance is not rebooted after Patch Manager runs. For more information, see Parameter name: RebootOption.) The summary of the patching operation can be found in the output of the Run Command request. Additional logs can be found on the instance in the %PROGRAMDATA%\Amazon\PatchBaselineOperations\Logs folder.
Because the Windows Update API is used to download and install patches, all Group Policy settings for Windows Update are respected. No Group Policy settings are required to use Patch Manager, but any settings that you have defined will be applied, such as to direct instances to a Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server.
Note
By default, Windows downloads all patches from Microsoft's Windows Update site because Patch Manager uses the Windows Update API to drive the download and installation of patches. As a result, the instance must be able to reach the Microsoft Windows Update site or patching will fail. Alternatively, you can configure a WSUS server to serve as a patch repository and configure your instances to target that WSUS server instead using Group Policies.
