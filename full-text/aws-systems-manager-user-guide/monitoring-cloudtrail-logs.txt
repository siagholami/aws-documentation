Logging AWS Systems Manager API calls with AWS CloudTrail
Systems Manager is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Systems Manager. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Systems Manager as events, including calls from the Systems Manager console and from code calls to the Systems Manager APIs. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an S3 bucket, including events for Systems Manager. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Systems Manager, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details. 
To learn more about CloudTrail, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
Systems Manager information in CloudTrail
CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When activity occurs in Systems Manager, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in Event history. You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account. For more information, see Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History. 
For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for Systems Manager, create a trail. A trail enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an S3 bucket. By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all regions. The trail logs events from all regions in the AWS partition and delivers the log files to the S3 bucket that you specify. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see:

 Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Regions and Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Accounts
All Systems Manager actions are logged by CloudTrail and are documented in the AWS Systems Manager API Reference. For example, calls to the CreateMaintenanceWindows, PutInventory, SendCommand, and StartSession actions generate entries in the CloudTrail log files. (For an example of setting up CloudTrail to monitor a Systems Manager API call, see  Monitoring session activity using Amazon EventBridge (console) .)
Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request. The identity information helps you determine the following: 
 Whether the request was made with root or IAM user credentials.
 Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a role or federated user.
 Whether the request was made by another AWS service.
For more information, see the CloudTrail userIdentity Element.
Understanding Systems Manager log file entries
A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an S3 bucket that you specify. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time of the action, request parameters, and so on. CloudTrail log files are not an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they do not appear in any specific order. 
The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry that demonstrates the DeleteDocuments action on a document named example-Document in the US East (Ohio) Region (us-east-2).
