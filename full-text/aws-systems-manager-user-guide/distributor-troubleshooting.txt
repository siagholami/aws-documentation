Wrong package with the same name is installed
Problem: You've installed a package, but AWS Systems Manager Distributor installed a different package instead.
Cause: During installation, AWS Systems Manager finds AWS-published packages as results before user-defined external packages. If your user-defined package name is the same as an AWS-published package name, the AWS package is installed instead of your package.
Solution: To avoid this problem, name your package something different from the name for an AWS-published package.
