AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter
OpsCenter provides a central location where operations engineers and IT professionals can view, investigate, and resolve operational work items (OpsItems) related to AWS resources. OpsCenter is designed to reduce mean time to resolution for issues impacting AWS resources. This Systems Manager capability aggregates and standardizes OpsItems across services while providing contextual investigation data about each OpsItem, related OpsItems, and related resources. OpsCenter also provides Systems Manager Automation documents (runbooks) that you can use to quickly resolve issues. You can specify searchable, custom data for each OpsItem. You can also view automatically-generated summary reports about OpsItems by status and source. 
OpsCenter is integrated with Amazon EventBridge. This means you can create EventBridge rules that automatically create OpsItems for any AWS service that publishes events to EventBridge. For example, you can configure SSM OpsItems as the target for the following types of events, and hundreds more:
 Security issues, such as alerts from AWS Security Hub
 Performance issues, such as a throttling event for Amazon DynamoDB or degraded Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume performance
 Failures, such as an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group failure to launch an instance or a Systems Manager Automation execution failure
 Health alerts, such as an AWS Health alert for scheduled maintenance
 State changes, such as an EC2 instance state change from Running to Stopped
OpsCenter is also integrated with Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server. This means you can automatically create OpsItems for problems detected in your applications.
Operations engineers and IT professionals can create, view, and edit OpsItems by using the OpsCenter page in the AWS Systems Manager console, public API actions, the AWS CLI, AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, or the AWS SDKs. You can also use AWS Lambda with Amazon SNS to create OpsItems from sources like CloudWatch alarms. OpsCenter public API actions also enable you to integrate OpsCenter with your case management systems and health dashboards. 
How can OpsCenter benefit my organization?
AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter enables a standard and unified experience for viewing, working on, and remediating issues related to AWS resources. A standard and unified experience improves the time it takes to remedy issues, investigate related issues, and train new operations engineers and IT professionals. A standard and unified experience also reduces the number of manual errors entered into the system of managing and remediating issues. 
More specifically, OpsCenter offers the following benefits for operations engineers and organizations:
 You no longer need to navigate across multiple console pages to view, investigate, and resolve OpsItems related to AWS resources. OpsItems are aggregated, across services, in a central location.
 You can view service-specific and contextually relevant data for OpsItems that are automatically generated by Amazon EventBridge and CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server.
 You can specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a resource related to an OpsItem. By specifying related resources, OpsCenter uses built-in logic to help you avoid creating duplicate OpsItems.
 You can view details and resolution information about similar OpsItems.
 You can quickly view information about and run Systems Manager Automation documents (runbooks) to resolve issues.
What are the features of OpsCenter?

Automated and manual OpsItem creation

OpsCenter is integrated with Amazon EventBridge. This means you can create EventBridge rules that automatically create OpsItems for any AWS service that publishes events to EventBridge. You can also manually create OpsItems.
OpsCenter is also integrated with Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server. This means you can automatically create OpsItems for problems detected in your applications.
 Detailed and searchable OpsItems
Each OpsItem includes multiple fields of information, including a title, ID, priority, description, the source of the OpsItem, and the date/time it was last updated. Each OpsItem also includes the following configurable features:
   Status: Open, In progress, Resolved, or Open and In progress.
   Related resources: A related resource is the impacted resource or the resource that triggered the Amazon EventBridge event that created the OpsItem. Each OpsItem includes a Related resources section where OpsCenter automatically lists the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the related resource. You can also manually specify ARNs of related resources. For some ARN types, OpsCenter automatically creates a deep link that displays details about the resource without having to visit other console pages to view that information. For example, if you specify the ARN of an EC2 instance, you can view all of the EC2-provided details about that instance in OpsCenter. You can manually add the ARNs of additional related resources. Each OpsItem can list a maximum of 100 related resource ARNs. For more information, see Working with related resources.
   Related and Similar OpsItems: The Related OpsItems feature lets you specify the IDs of OpsItems that are in some way related to the current OpsItem. The Similar OpsItem feature automatically reviews OpsItem titles and descriptions and then lists other OpsItems that may be related or of interest to you.
   Searchable and private operational data: Operational data is custom data that provides useful reference details about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, error strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data. You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a maximum length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20 KB.
This custom data is searchable, but with restrictions\. For the **Searchable operational data** feature, all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page \(as provided by the [DescribeOpsItems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOpsItems.html) API action\) can view and search on the specified data\. For the **Private operational data** feature, the data is only viewable by users who have access to the OpsItem \(as provided by the [GetOpsItem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_GetOpsItem.html) API action\)\.


Deduplication: By specifying related resources, OpsCenter uses built-in logic to help you avoid creating duplicate OpsItems. Additionally, OpsItems that are automatically created from an event in EventBridge include a deduplication string to reduce the number of duplicate OpsItems. For more information, see Reducing duplicate OpsItems. 
Easy remediation using runbooks

Each OpsItem includes a Runbooks section with a list of Systems Manager Automation documents that you can use to automatically remediate common issues with AWS resources. If you open an OpsItem, choose an AWS resource for that OpsItem, and then choose the Run automation button in the console, then OpsCenter provides a list of Automation documents that you can run on the AWS resource that generated the OpsItem. After you run an Automation document (runbook) from an OpsItem, the runbook is automatically associated with the related resource of the OpsItem for future reference. Additionally, if you automatically set up OpsItem rules in Amazon EventBridge by using OpsCenter, then EventBridge automatically associates runbooks for common events. OpsCenter keeps a 30-day record of Automation documents run for a specific OpsItem. For more information, see Remediating OpsItem issues using Systems Manager Automation.
 Change notification: You can specify the ARN of an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic and publish notifications anytime an OpsItem is changed or edited. The SNS topic must exist in the same AWS Region as the OpsItem.
 Comprehensive OpsItem search capabilities: OpsCenter provides multiple search options to help you quickly locate OpsItems. Here a few examples of how you can search: OpsItem ID, Title, Last modified time, Operational data value, Source, and Automation ID of a runbook execution, to name a few. You can further limit search results by using status filters. 
 OpsItem summary reports
OpsCenter includes a summary report page that automatically displays the following sections:
   Status summary: a summary of OpsItems by status (Open, In progress, Resolved, Open and In progress).
   Sources with most open OpsItems: a breakdown of the top AWS services with open OpsItems.
   OpsItems by source and age: a count of OpsItems grouped by source and days since creation.
For more information about viewing OpsCenter summary reports, see Viewing OpsCenter summary reports.
 IAM access control
By using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, you can control which members of your organization can create, view, list, and update OpsItems. You can also assign tags to OpsItems and then create IAM policies that give access to users and groups based on tags. For more information, see Getting started with OpsCenter.
 Logging and auditing capability support
You can audit and log OpsCenter user actions in your AWS account through integration with other AWS services. For more information, see Auditing and logging OpsCenter activity.
 Console, CLI, PowerShell, and SDK access to OpsCenter capabilities
You can work with OpsCenter by using the AWS Systems Manager console, AWS CLI, AWS Tools for PowerShell, or the AWS SDK of your choice.
How does OpsCenter work with Amazon EventBridge? Which service should I use?
Amazon EventBridge delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams. Generally speaking, EventBridge lets you know there is a problem with your resources.
OpsCenter helps you investigate and remediate the problem. OpsCenter brings together data from EventBridge or data entered manually by engineers so that your engineers can perform a thorough investigation. OpsCenter also provides Automation runbooks for quickly remediating those issues. OpsCenter integrates with EventBridge by enabling you to automatically create OpsItems (or you can manually create OpsItems) to address the following types of issues: performance degradation, state changes, execution failures, maintenance notifications, and security alerts.
Does OpsCenter integrate with my existing case management system?
OpsCenter is designed to complement your existing case management systems. You can integrate OpsItems into your existing case management system by using public API actions. You can also maintain manual lifecycle workflows in your current systems and use OpsCenter as an investigation and remediation hub. 
For information about OpsCenter public API actions, see the following API actions in the AWS Systems Manager API Reference.
