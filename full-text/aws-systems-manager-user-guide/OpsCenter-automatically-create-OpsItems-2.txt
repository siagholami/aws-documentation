Configuring EventBridge to automatically create OpsItems for specific events
Use the following procedure to configure SSM OpsItems as the target of an EventBridge event. When EventBridge receives the event, it creates a new OpsItem in OpsCenter.
To configure OpsCenter as a target of a CloudWatch event


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rule, and then either choose to create a new rule or edit an existing rule.


After verifying the details of the rule, for Select event bus, choose AWS default event bus.


For Target list, choose SSM OpsItem. 


Expand Configure input and verify that Matched event is selected.


Choose Create a new role for this specific resource to create a new role with the required permissions. Or, choose Use existing role and choose the IAM role you created that gives CloudWatch permission to create OpsItems in OpsCenter. For more information about the required role and permissions, see Getting started with OpsCenter.


If creating a new rule, choose Create.


-or-
If editing a rule, choose Update.

In the navigation pane, choose Rules. If you created a new rule, verify that the list includes a new rule that begins with AwsSSMOpsCenter-*, such as AwsSSMOpsCenter-EC2 or AwsSSMOpsCenter-DynamoDB.

After an OpsItem is created from an event, you can view the event details by opening the OpsItem and scrolling down to the Private operational data section.

For information about how to configure the options in an OpsItem, see Working with OpsItems.
