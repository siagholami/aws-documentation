Working with Session Manager
You can use the AWS Systems Manager console, the Amazon EC2 console, or the AWS CLI to start sessions that connect you to the EC2 instances your system administrator has granted you access to using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. Depending on your permissions, you can also view information about sessions, resume inactive sessions that have not timed out, and end sessions.
For more information about sessions, see What is a session?
