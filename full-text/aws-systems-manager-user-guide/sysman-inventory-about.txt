Learn more about Systems Manager Inventory
When you configure Systems Manager Inventory, you specify the type of metadata to collect, the instances from where the metadata should be collected, and a schedule for metadata collection. These configurations are saved with your AWS account as a Systems Manager State Manager association. An association is simply a configuration.
Note
Inventory only collects metadata. It does not collect any personal or proprietary data.
