Using Roles to Collect Inventory and Run Maintenance Windows Tasks
AWS Systems Manager uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Systems Manager. Service-linked roles are predefined by Systems Manager and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. 
A service-linked role makes setting up Systems Manager easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions. Systems Manager defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only Systems Manager can assume its roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy can't be attached to any other IAM entity.
For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS Services That Work with IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column. Choose a Yes with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.
Service-linked role permissions for Systems Manager
Systems Manager uses the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM – AWS Systems Manager uses this IAM service role to manage AWS resources on your behalf.
The AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM service-linked role trusts only ssm.amazonaws.com to assume this role. 
Currently, only two Systems Manager capabilities use the service-linked role: 
 Inventory requires a service-linked role. The role enables the system to collect Inventory metadata from tags and Resource Groups.
 The Maintenance Windows capability can optionally use the service-linked role. The role enables the Maintenance Windows service to run maintenance tasks on target instances. Note that the service-linked role for Systems Manager doesn't provide the permissions needed for all scenarios. For more information, see Should I use a service-linked role or a custom service role to run maintenance window tasks?
The AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM service-linked role permissions policy allows Systems Manager to complete the following actions on all related resources ("Resource": "*"), except where indicated:
 ssm:CancelCommand
 ssm:GetCommandInvocation
 ssm:ListCommandInvocations
 ssm:ListCommands
 ssm:SendCommand
 ssm:GetAutomationExecution
 ssm:GetParameters
 ssm:StartAutomationExecution
 ssm:ListTagsForResource
 ec2:DescribeInstanceAttribute
 ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus
 ec2:DescribeInstances
 lambda:InvokeFunction¹
 states:DescribeExecution²
 states:StartExecution²
 resource-groups:ListGroups
 resource-groups:ListGroupResources
 resource-groups:GetGroupQuery
 cloudformation:DescribeStacks
 config:SelectResourceConfig
 compute-optimizer:GetEC2InstanceRecommendations
 support:DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks
 support:DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries
 support:DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult
 iam:PassRole³
¹ The lambda:InvokeFunction action is allowed permissions for the following resources only:
arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:SSM*
arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:*:SSM*
² The states: actions are allowed permssions on the following resources only:
arn:aws:states:*:*:stateMachine:SSM*
arn:aws:states:*:*:execution:SSM*
³ The iam:PassRole action is allowed permissions by the following condition for the Systems Manager service only:
"Condition": {
   "StringEquals": {
      "iam:PassedToService": [
         "ssm.amazonaws.com"
      ]
   }
}
Creating a service-linked role for Systems Manager
You can use the IAM console to create a service-linked role with the EC2 use case. In the IAM CLI or the IAM API, create a service-linked role with the ssm.amazonaws.com service name. For more information, see Creating a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
For maintenance windows only, you don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you create a maintenance window task in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Systems Manager API, Systems Manager creates the service-linked role for you if you choose not to provide a custom service role.
If you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account. 
Editing a service-linked role for Systems Manager
Systems Manager does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
Deleting a service-linked role for Systems Manager
If you no longer need to use any feature or service that requires a service-linked role, then we recommend that you delete that role. That way you don’t have an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained. You can use the IAM console, the IAM CLI, or the IAM API to manually delete the service-linked role. To do this, you must first manually clean up the resources for your service-linked role, and then you can manually delete it.
Because the Systems Manager service-linked role can be used by both the Inventory and Maintenance Windows capabilities, ensure that neither is using the role before attempting to delete it.
 Inventory: If you delete the service-linked role used by Systems Manager Inventory, then the Inventory data for tags and Resource Groups will no longer be synchronized. You must clean up the resources for your service-linked role before you can manually delete it.
 Maintenance Windows: You can't delete the service-linked role if any maintenance window tasks currently rely on the role. You must first remove the service-linked role from the tasks before you can delete the role. 
Note
If the Systems Manager service is using the role when you try to delete the tags, Resource Groups, or maintenance window tasks, then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.
