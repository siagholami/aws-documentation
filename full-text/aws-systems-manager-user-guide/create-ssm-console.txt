(Optional) For Target type, specify the type of resources the document can run on.


In the Document type list, choose the type of document you want to create.


Delete the brackets in the Content field, and then paste the document content you created earlier.


(Optional) In the Document tags section, apply one or more tag key name/value pairs to the document.


Tags are optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag a document to identify the type of tasks it runs, the type of operating systems it targets, and the environment it runs in. In this case, you could specify the following key name/value pairs:
    Key=TaskType,Value=MyConfigurationUpdate
    Key=OS,Value=AMAZON_LINUX_2
    Key=Environment,Value=Production
For more information about tagging Systems Manager resources, see Tagging Systems Manager resources.

Choose Create document to save the document.
