Running commands from the console
You can use Run Command from the console to configure instances without having to login to each instance. This topic includes an example that shows how to update SSM Agent on an instance by using Run Command.
Before You Begin
Before you send a command using Run Command, verify that your instances meet Systems Manager requirements.
To send a command using Run Command


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Run Command.


-or-
If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon () to open the navigation pane, and then choose Run Command.


Choose Run command.


In the Command document list, choose a Systems Manager document.


In the Command parameters section, specify values for required parameters.


In the Targets section, identify the instances on which you want to run this operation by specifying tags, selecting instances manually, or specifying a resource group.
Note
If you choose to select instances manually, and an instance you expect to see is not included in the list, see Some of my instances are missing for troubleshooting tips.


For Other parameters:
    For Comment, type information about this command.
    For Timeout (seconds), specify the number of seconds for the system to wait before failing the overall command execution. 


(Optional) For Rate control:
    For Concurrency, specify either a number or a percentage of instances on which to run the command at the same time.
Note
If you selected targets by specifying tags applied to managed instances or by specifying AWS resource groups, and you are not certain how many instances are targeted, then restrict the number of instances that can run the document at the same time by specifying a percentage.
    For Error threshold, specify when to stop running the command on other instances after it fails on either a number or a percentage of instances. For example, if you specify three errors, then Systems Manager stops sending the command when the fourth error is received. Instances still processing the command might also send errors.


(Optional) For Output options, to save the command output to a file, select the Write command output to an S3 bucket box. Type the bucket and prefix (folder) names in the boxes.
Note
The S3 permissions that grant the ability to write the data to an S3 bucket are those of the instance profile assigned to the instance, not those of the IAM user performing this task. For more information, see Create an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager. In addition, if the specified S3 bucket is in a different AWS account, ensure that the instance profile associated with the instance has the necessary permissions to write to that bucket.


In the SNS notifications section, if you want notifications sent about the status of the command execution, select the Enable SNS notifications check box.


For more information about configuring Amazon SNS notifications for Run Command, see Monitoring Systems Manager status changes using Amazon SNS notifications.

Choose Run.

For information about canceling a command, see Canceling a command. 
Rerunning commands
Systems Manager includes two options to help you rerun a command from the Run Command page in the AWS Systems Manager console. 
 Rerun: This button enables you to run the same command without making changes to it.
 Copy to new: This button copies the settings of one command to a new command and gives you the option to edit those settings before you run it.
To rerun a command


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Run Command.


-or-
If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon () to open the navigation pane, and then choose Run Command.


Choose a command to rerun. You can rerun a command immediately after executing it from the command details page. Or, you can choose a command that you previously executed from the Command history tab.


Choose either Rerun to run the same command without changes, or choose Copy to new to edit the command settings before you run it.


Update SSM Agent by using Run Command
The following procedure describes how to quickly update SSM Agent running on your Windows Server and Linux instances. You can update to either the latest version or downgrade to an older version. When you run the command, the system downloads the version from AWS, installs it, and then uninstalls the version that existed before the command was run. If an error occurs during this process, the system rolls back to the version on the server before the command was run and the command status shows that the command failed.
Note
Note the following details about automatically updating SSM Agent:
Beginning September 21, 2020, auto-update installs SSM Agent version 3.0. For more information, see SSM Agent version 3.
To be notified about SSM Agent updates, subscribe to the SSM Agent Release Notes page on GitHub.
To update SSM Agent using Run Command


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Run Command.


-or-
If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon () to open the navigation pane, and then choose Run Command.


Choose Run command.


In the Command document list, choose AWS-UpdateSSMAgent.


In the Command parameters section, specify values for the following parameters, if you want:


(Optional) For Version, type the version of SSM Agent to install. You can install older versions of the agent. If you do not specify a version, the service installs the latest version.


(Optional) For Allow Downgrade, choose true to install an earlier version of SSM Agent. If you choose this option, you must specify the earlier version number. Choose false to install only the newest version of the service.


In the Targets section, identify the instances on which you want to run this operation by specifying tags, selecting instances manually, or specifying a resource group.
Note
If you choose to select instances manually, and an instance you expect to see is not included in the list, see Some of my instances are missing for troubleshooting tips.


For Other parameters:
    For Comment, type information about this command.
    For Timeout (seconds), specify the number of seconds for the system to wait before failing the overall command execution. 


(Optional) For Rate control:
    For Concurrency, specify either a number or a percentage of instances on which to run the command at the same time.
Note
If you selected targets by specifying tags applied to managed instances or by specifying AWS resource groups, and you are not certain how many instances are targeted, then restrict the number of instances that can run the document at the same time by specifying a percentage.
    For Error threshold, specify when to stop running the command on other instances after it fails on either a number or a percentage of instances. For example, if you specify three errors, then Systems Manager stops sending the command when the fourth error is received. Instances still processing the command might also send errors.


(Optional) For Output options, to save the command output to a file, select the Write command output to an S3 bucket box. Type the bucket and prefix (folder) names in the boxes.
Note
The S3 permissions that grant the ability to write the data to an S3 bucket are those of the instance profile assigned to the instance, not those of the IAM user performing this task. For more information, see Create an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager. In addition, if the specified S3 bucket is in a different AWS account, ensure that the instance profile associated with the instance has the necessary permissions to write to that bucket.


In the SNS notifications section, if you want notifications sent about the status of the command execution, select the Enable SNS notifications check box.

Update PowerShell using Run Command
The following procedure describes how to update PowerShell to version 5.1 on your Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 instances. The script provided in this procedure downloads the Windows Management Framework (WMF) version 5.1 update, and starts the installation of the update. The instance reboots during this process because this is required when installing WMF 5.1. The download and installation of the update takes approximately five minutes to complete.
To update PowerShell using Run Command


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Run Command.


-or-
If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon () to open the navigation pane, and then choose Run Command.

After the instance reboots and the installation of the update is complete, connect to your instance to confirm that PowerShell successfully upgraded to version 5.1. To check the version of PowerShell on your instance, open PowerShell and enter $PSVersionTable. The PSVersion value in the output table shows 5.1 if the upgrade was successful.
If the PSVersion value is different than 5.1, for example 3.0 or 4.0, review the Setup logs in Event Viewer under Windows Logs. These logs indicate why the update installation failed.
