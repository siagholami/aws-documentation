Configure SSM Agent to use a proxy
You can configure SSM Agent to communicate through an HTTP proxy by adding the http_proxy, https_proxy, and no_proxy settings to an amazon-ssm-agent.override configuration file. An override file also preserves the proxy settings if you install newer or older versions of SSM Agent. This section includes procedures for upstart and systemd environments. 
Note
Instances created from an Amazon Linux AMI that are using a proxy must be running a current version of the Python requests module in order to support Patch Manager operations. For more information, see Upgrade the Python requests module on Amazon Linux instances that use a proxy server.

Connect to the instance where you installed SSM Agent.


Open a simple editor like VIM, and depending on whether you're using an HTTP proxy server or HTTPS proxy server, specify one of the following setting options.


HTTP proxy server:
env http_proxy=http://hostname:port
   env https_proxy=http://hostname:port
   env no_proxy=169.254.169.254
HTTPS proxy server:
env http_proxy=http://hostname:port
   env https_proxy=https://hostname:port
   env no_proxy=169.254.169.254
Note
You must add the no_proxy setting to the file and specify the IP address listed here. It is the instance metadata endpoint for Systems Manager. Without this IP address, calls to Systems Manager fail.


Save the file as amazon-ssm-agent.override in the following location: /etc/init/


Stop and restart SSM Agent using the following commands:


sudo stop amazon-ssm-agent
   sudo start amazon-ssm-agent
Note
For more information about working with .override files in Upstart environments, see init: Upstart init daemon job configuration.
Configure SSM Agent to use a proxy (systemd)
The steps in the following procedure describe how to configure SSM Agent to use a proxy in systemd environments. Some of the steps in this procedure contain explicit instructions for Ubuntu Server instances installed by using Snap.


Connect to the instance where you installed SSM Agent.


Run one of the follow commands, depending on the operating system type.
    On Ubuntu Server instances where SSM Agent is installed by using a snap:
systemctl edit snap.amazon-ssm-agent.amazon-ssm-agent
On other operating systems:
systemctl edit amazon-ssm-agent


Open a simple editor like VIM, and depending on whether you're using an HTTP proxy server or HTTPS proxy server, specify one of the following setting options.


HTTP proxy server:
[Service]
   Environment="http_proxy=http://hostname:port"
   Environment="https_proxy=http://hostname:port"
   Environment="no_proxy=169.254.169.254"
HTTPS proxy server:
[Service]
   Environment="http_proxy=http://hostname:port"
   Environment="https_proxy=https://hostname:port"
   Environment="no_proxy=169.254.169.254"
Note
You must add the no_proxy setting to the file and specify the IP address listed here. It is the instance metadata endpoint for Systems Manager. Without this IP address, calls to Systems Manager fail.


Save your changes. The system creates one of the following files, depending on the operating system type.
    On Ubuntu Server instances where SSM Agent is installed by using a snap: 
etc/systemd/system/snap.amazon-ssm-agent.amazon-ssm-agent.service.d/override.conf
    On Amazon Linux 2 instances: 
etc/systemd/system/amazon-ssm-agent.service.d/override.conf
    On other operating systems: 
etc/systemd/system/amazon-ssm-agent.service.d/amazon-ssm-agent.override


Restart SSM Agent by using one of the following commands, depending on the operating system type.
    On Ubuntu Server instances installed by using a snap:
systemctl start snap.amazon-ssm-agent.amazon-ssm-agent
    On other operating systems:
sudo systemctl stop amazon-ssm-agent ; sudo systemctl daemon-reload
