AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management. You can store data such as passwords, database strings, Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs, and license codes as parameter values. You can store values as plain text or encrypted data. You can reference Systems Manager parameters in your scripts, commands, SSM documents, and configuration and automation workflows by using the unique name that you specified when you created the parameter. 
Important
Do not store sensitive data in a String or StringList parameter. For all sensitive data that must remain encrypted, use only the SecureString parameter type.
For more information, see Parameter types and examples and SecureString parameters.
Parameter Store offers the following benefits and features.
 Use a secure, scalable, hosted secrets management service with no servers to manage.
 Improve your security posture by separating your data from your code.
 Store configuration data and encrypted strings in hierarchies and track versions.
 Control and audit access at granular levels.
 Configure change notifications and trigger automated actions for both parameters and parameter policies.
 Tag parameters individually, and then secure access from different levels, including operational, parameter, Amazon EC2 tag, and path levels. 
 Validation of ID format when you specify an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID as a parameter value.
 Reference AWS Secrets Manager secrets by using Parameter Store parameters.
 Use Parameter Store parameters with other Systems Manager capabilities and AWS services to retrieve secrets and configuration data from a central store. 
Parameters work with Systems Manager capabilities such as Run Command, State Manager, and Automation. You can also reference parameters in a number of other AWS services, including the following:
   Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
   Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
   AWS Secrets Manager
   AWS Lambda
   AWS CloudFormation
   AWS CodeBuild
   AWS CodePipeline
   AWS CodeDeploy
 Configure integration with the following AWS services for encryption, notification, monitoring, and auditing:
   AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
   Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)
   Amazon CloudWatch
   Amazon EventBridge
   AWS CloudTrail
Tagging a parameter
You can tag your parameters to help you quickly identify one or more parameters based on the tags you've assigned to them. For example, you can tag parameters for specific environments, departments, users, groups, or periods. You can also restrict access to parameters by creating an IAM policy that specifies the tags that a user or group can access. For more information, see Tagging Systems Manager parameters.
Amazon EventBridge support
This Systems Manager capability is supported as an event type in EventBridge rules. For information, see Monitoring Systems Manager events with Amazon EventBridge and Reference: Amazon EventBridge event patterns and types for Systems Manager.
