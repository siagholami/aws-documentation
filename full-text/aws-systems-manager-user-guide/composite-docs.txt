Creating composite documents
A composite SSM document is a custom document that performs a series of actions by running one or more secondary SSM documents. Composite documents promote infrastructure as code by enabling you to create a standard set of SSM documents for common tasks such as boot-strapping software or domain-joining instances. You can then share these documents across AWS accounts in the same AWS Region to reduce SSM document maintenance and ensure consistency.
For example, you can create a composite document that performs the following actions:


Updates SSM Agent to the latest version.


Installs all whitelisted patches.


Installs antivirus software.


Downloads scripts from GitHub and runs them.


In this example, your custom SSM document includes the following plugins to perform these actions:


The aws:runDocument plugin to run the AWS-UpdateSSMAgent document, which updates SSM Agent to the latest version.


The aws:runDocument plugin to run the legacy AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline document, which installs all whitelisted patches.


The aws:runDocument plugin to run the AWS-InstallApplication document, which installs the antivirus software.


The aws:downloadContent plugin to download scripts from GitHub and run them.


Composite and secondary documents can be stored in Systems Manager, GitHub (public and private repositories), or Amazon S3. Composite documents and secondary documents can be created in JSON or YAML. 
Note
Composite documents can only run to a maximum depth of three documents. This means that a composite document can call a child document; and that child document can call one last document.
Create a composite document
To create a composite document, add the aws:runDocument plugin in a custom SSM document and specify the required inputs. The following is an example of a composite document that performs the following actions:


Runs the aws:downloadContent plugin to download an SSM document from a GitHub public repository to a local directory called bootstrap. The SSM document is called StateManagerBootstrap.yml (a YAML document).


Runs the aws:runDocument plugin to run the StateManagerBootstrap.yml document. No parameters are specified.


Runs the aws:runDocument plugin to run the AWS-ConfigureDocker pre-defined SSM document. The specified parameters install Docker on the instance.
