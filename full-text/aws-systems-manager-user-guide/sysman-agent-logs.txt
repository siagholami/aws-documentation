Viewing SSM Agent logs
SSM Agent writes information about executions, commands, scheduled actions, errors, and health statuses to log files on each instance. You can view log files by manually connecting to an instance, or you can automatically send logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For more information about sending logs to CloudWatch, see Monitoring AWS Systems Manager.
You can view SSM Agent logs on instances in the following locations.

[ Linux ]
/var/log/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.log
/var/log/amazon/ssm/errors.log
/var/log/amazon/ssm/audits/amazon-ssm-agent-audit-YYYY-MM-DD

[ Windows ]
%PROGRAMDATA%\Amazon\SSM\Logs\amazon-ssm-agent.log
%PROGRAMDATA%\Amazon\SSM\Logs\errors.log
%PROGRAMDATA%\Amazon\SSM\Logs\audits\amazon-ssm-agent-audit-YYYY-MM-DD

For Linux instances, the SSM Agent sterr and stdout files are written to the following directory: /var/lib/amazon/ssm.
