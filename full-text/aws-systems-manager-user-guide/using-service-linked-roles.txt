Using service-linked roles for Systems Manager
AWS Systems Manager uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Systems Manager. Service-linked roles are predefined by Systems Manager and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.
