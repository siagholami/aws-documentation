Create a Change Calendar entry
When you create an AWS Systems ManagerChange Calendar entry, you are creating a Systems Manager document that uses the text format.
Create a Change Calendar entry (console)


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Change Calendar.


On the Change Calendar home page, choose Create calendar.


On the Create calendar page, in Calendar details, enter a name for your calendar entry. Calendar entry names can contain letters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores. The name should be specific enough to identify the purpose of the calendar entry at a glance. An example is support-off-hours. You cannot update this name after you create the calendar entry.


In Description, enter a description for your calendar entry.


In Calendar type, choose one of the following.
    Open by default - the calendar is open (Automation actions can run until an event starts), then closed for the duration of an associated event.
    Closed by default - the calendar is closed (Automation actions cannot run until an event starts) but open for the duration of an associated event.


Choose Create calendar.


After the calendar entry is created, Systems Manager displays your calendar entry in the Change Calendar list. The columns show the calendar version, and the calendar owner's AWS account number. Your calendar entry cannot prevent or allow any actions until you add at least one event. For information about how to add an event, see Create a Change Calendar event.
