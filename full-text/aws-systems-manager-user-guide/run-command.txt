Running commands using Systems Manager Run Command
This section includes information about how to send commands from the AWS Systems Manager console, and how to send commands to a fleet of instances by using the Targets parameter with EC2 tags. This section also includes information about how to cancel a command.
Tip
If this is your first time using Run Command, we recommend executing commands against a test instance or an instance that is not being used in a production environment.
For information about how to send commands using Windows PowerShell, see Walkthrough: Use the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell with Run Command or the examples in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS Tools for PowerShell Cmdlet Reference. For information about how to send commands using the AWS CLI, see the Walkthrough: Use the AWS CLI with Run Command or the examples in the SSM CLI Reference.
Important
When you run a command in Run Command, do not include any sensitive information formatted as plaintext, such as passwords, configuration data, or other secrets. All Systems Manager API activity in your account is logged in an Amazon S3 bucket, in AWS CloudTrail logs. This means that any user with access to that S3 bucket can view the plaintext values of those secrets. For this reason, we strongly recommend creating and using SecureString parameters to encrypt the sensitive data you use in your Systems Manager operations.
For more information, see SecureString parameters.
