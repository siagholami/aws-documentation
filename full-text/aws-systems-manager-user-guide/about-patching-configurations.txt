About patching configurations
A patching configuration defines a unique patching operation. The configuration specifies the instances for patching, which patch baseline is to be applied, the schedule for patching, and typically, the maintenance window that the configuration is to be associated with. 
To create a patching configuration, use the Configure patching page. This page lets you associate a patching configuration with an existing maintenance window, create a new maintenance window for the configuration, or run a one-time manual patching operation on a set of instances. For more information, see Creating a patching configuration (console).
