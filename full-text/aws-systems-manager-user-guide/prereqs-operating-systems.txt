Important
SSM Agent requires Windows PowerShell 3.0 or later to run certain SSM Documents on Windows Server instances (for example, the legacy AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline document). Verify that your Windows Server instances are running Windows Management Framework 3.0 or later. This framework includes Windows PowerShell. For more information, see Windows Management Framework 3.0.
