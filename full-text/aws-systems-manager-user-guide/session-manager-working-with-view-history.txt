View session history
You can use the AWS Systems Manager console or the AWS CLI to view information about sessions in your account. In the console, you can view session details such the following:
 The ID of the session
 Which user connected to an instance through a session
 The ID of the instance
 When the session began and ended
 The status of the session
 The location specified for storing session logs (if enabled)
Using the AWS CLI, you can view a list of sessions in your account, but not the additional details that are available in the console.
For information about auditing and logging session history information, see Auditing and logging session activity.
