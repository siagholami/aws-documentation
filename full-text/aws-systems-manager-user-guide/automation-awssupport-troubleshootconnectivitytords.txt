AWSSupport-TroubleshootConnectivityToRDS
Description 
The AWSSupport-TroubleshootConnectivityToRDS Automation document diagnoses connectivity issues between an EC2 instance and an Amazon Relational Database Service instance. The automation ensures the DB instance is available, and then checks the associated security group rules, network access control lists (network ACLs), and route tables for potential connectivity issues.
