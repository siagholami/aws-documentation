Example: Service provider configures the service
Consider the following example, where a service runs on instances in Provider VPC 1. Resources that are in Consumer VPC 1 can directly access the service through the AWS PrivateLink VPC endpoint in Consumer VPC 1.

To allow resources that are in Consumer VPC 2 to privately access the service, the service provider must complete the following steps:


Create Provider VPC 2.


Configure VPC peering between Provider VPC 1 and Provider VPC 2 so that traffic can route between the two VPCs.


Create Network Load Balancer 2 in Provider VPC 2.


Configure target groups on Network Load Balancer 2 that point to the IP addresses of the service instances that are in VPC 1.


Adjust the security groups that are associated with the service instances in Provider VPC 1 so that they allow traffic from Network Load Balancer 2.


Create a VPC endpoint service configuration in Provider VPC 2 and associate it with Network Load Balancer 2. The service consumer can then create an interface endpoint in Consumer VPC 2 to the service in Provider VPC 2.
