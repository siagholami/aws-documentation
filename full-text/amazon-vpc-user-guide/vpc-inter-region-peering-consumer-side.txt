Example: Service consumer configures access across Regions
Consider the following example, where a service runs on instances in Provider VPC in Region B, for example the us-east-1 Region. Resources that are in Consumer VPC 3 can directly access the service through an AWS PrivateLink VPC interface endpoint in Consumer VPC 3.

To allow resources that are in Consumer VPC 1 to privately access the service, the service consumer must complete the following steps:


Create Consumer VPC 2 in Region B.


Create a VPC interface endpoint that spans one or more subnets in Consumer VPC 2.


Adjust the security groups associated with the VPC endpoint service in Consumer VPC 2 to allow traffic from the instances in Consumer VPC 1. Adjust the security groups associated with the instances in Consumer VPC 1 to allow traffic to the VPC endpoint service in Consumer VPC 2.


Configure VPC inter-region peering between Consumer VPC 1 and Consumer VPC 2 so that traffic is routed between the two VPCs.


After the configuration is complete, Consumer VPC 1 can privately access the service.
The consumer account incurs the inter-region peering data transfer charges, VPC endpoint data processing charges, and the VPC endpoint hourly charges. The provider incurs the Network Load Balancer charges, and the service instances charges.
