Deleting an endpoint service configuration
You can delete an endpoint service configuration. Deleting the configuration does not delete the application hosted in your VPC or the associated load balancers. 
Before you delete the endpoint service configuration, you must reject any available or pending-acceptance VPC endpoints that are attached to the service. For more information, see Accepting and rejecting interface endpoint connection requests.
