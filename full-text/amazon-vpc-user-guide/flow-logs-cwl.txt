Publishing flow logs to CloudWatch Logs
Flow logs can publish flow log data directly to Amazon CloudWatch.
When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log data is published to a log group, and each network interface has a unique log stream in the log group. Log streams contain flow log records. You can create multiple flow logs that publish data to the same log group. If the same network interface is present in one or more flow logs in the same log group, it has one combined log stream. If you've specified that one flow log should capture rejected traffic, and the other flow log should capture accepted traffic, then the combined log stream captures all traffic. For more information, see Flow log records.
In CloudWatch Logs, the timestamp field corresponds to the start time that's captured in the flow log record. The ingestionTime field indicates the date and time when the flow log record was received by CloudWatch Logs. This timestamp is later than the end time that's captured in the flow log record.

IAM roles for publishing flow logs to CloudWatch Logs
The IAM role that's associated with your flow log must have sufficient permissions to publish flow logs to the specified log group in CloudWatch Logs. The IAM role must belong to your AWS account.
The IAM policy that's attached to your IAM role must include at least the following permissions.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Also ensure that your role has a trust relationship that allows the flow logs service to assume the role.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
Users must also have permissions to use the iam:PassRole action for the IAM role that's associated with the flow log.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["iam:PassRole"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/flow-log-role-name"
    }
  ]
}
You can update an existing role or use the following procedure to create a new role for use with flow logs.
Creating a flow logs role
To create an IAM role for flow logs


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles, Create role.


Choose EC2 as the service to use this role. For Use case, choose EC2. Choose Next: Permissions.


On the Attach permissions policies page, choose Next: Tags and optionally add tags. Choose Next: Review.


Enter a name for your role (for example, Flow-Logs-Role) and optionally provide a description. Choose Create role.

Copy the first policy from IAM roles for publishing flow logs to CloudWatch Logs and paste it in the window. Choose Review policy.


Enter a name for your policy, and choose Create policy.


Select the name of your role. For Trust relationships, choose Edit trust relationship. In the existing policy document, change the service from ec2.amazonaws.com to vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com. Choose Update Trust Policy.


On the Summary page, note the ARN for your role. You need this ARN when you create your flow log.


Creating a flow log that publishes to CloudWatch Logs
You can create flow logs for your VPCs, subnets, or network interfaces.
To create a flow log for a network interface using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Network Interfaces.


Select one or more network interfaces and choose Actions, Create flow log.


For Filter, specify the type of IP traffic data to log. Choose All to log accepted and rejected traffic, Rejected to record only rejected traffic, or Accepted to record only accepted traffic.


For Maximum aggregation interval, choose the maximum period of time during which a flow is captured and aggregated into one flow log record.


For Destination, choose Send to CloudWatch Logs.


For Destination log group, enter the name of a log group in CloudWatch Logs to which the flow logs are to be published. If you specify the name of a log group that does not exist, we attempt to create the log group for you.


For IAM role, specify the name of the role that has permissions to publish logs to CloudWatch Logs.


For Format, specify the format for the flow log record.
    To use the default flow log record format, choose AWS default format.
    To create a custom format, choose Custom format. For Log format, choose the fields to include in the flow log record.
Tip
To create a custom flow log that includes the default format fields, first choose AWS default format, copy the fields in Format preview, then choose Custom format and paste the fields in the text box.


(Optional) Choose Add Tag to apply tags to the flow log.


Choose Create.


To create a flow log for a VPC or a subnet using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Your VPCs or Subnets.


Select one or more VPCs or subnets and then choose Actions, Create flow log.


For Filter, specify the type of IP traffic data to log. Choose All to log accepted and rejected traffic, Rejected to record only rejected traffic, or Accepted to record only accepted traffic.


For Maximum aggregation interval, choose the maximum period of time during which a flow is captured and aggregated into one flow log record.


For Destination, choose Send to CloudWatch Logs.


For Destination log group, enter the name of a log group in CloudWatch Logs to which the flow logs are to be published. If you specify the name of a log group that does not exist, we attempt to create the log group for you.


For IAM role, specify the name of the IAM role that has permissions to publish logs to CloudWatch Logs.


For Format, specify the format for the flow log record.
    To use the default flow log record format, choose AWS default format.

Choose Create.


To create a flow log that publishes to CloudWatch Logs using a command line tool
Use one of the following commands.
 create-flow-logs (AWS CLI)
 New-EC2FlowLogs (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)
 CreateFlowLogs (Amazon EC2 Query API)
The following AWS CLI example creates a flow log that captures all accepted traffic for subnet subnet-1a2b3c4d. The flow logs are delivered to a log group in CloudWatch Logs called my-flow-logs, in account 123456789101, using the IAM role publishFlowLogs.
aws ec2 create-flow-logs --resource-type Subnet --resource-ids subnet-1a2b3c4d --traffic-type ACCEPT --log-group-name my-flow-logs --deliver-logs-permission-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789101:role/publishFlowLogs
Processing flow log records in CloudWatch Logs
You can work with flow log records as you would with any other log events collected by CloudWatch Logs. For more information about monitoring log data and metric filters, see Searching and Filtering Log Data in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Example: Creating a CloudWatch metric filter and alarm for a flow log
In this example, you have a flow log for eni-1a2b3c4d. You want to create an alarm that alerts you if there have been 10 or more rejected attempts to connect to your instance over TCP port 22 (SSH) within a 1-hour time period. First, you must create a metric filter that matches the pattern of the traffic for which to create the alarm. Then, you can create an alarm for the metric filter.
To create a metric filter for rejected SSH traffic and create an alarm for the filter


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Logs.


Choose the associated Metric Filters value for the log group for your flow log, and then choose Add Metric Filter.


For Filter Pattern, enter the following.


[version, account, eni, source, destination, srcport, destport="22", protocol="6", packets, bytes, windowstart, windowend, action="REJECT", flowlogstatus]


For Select Log Data to Test, select the log stream for your network interface. (Optional) To view the lines of log data that match the filter pattern, choose Test Pattern. When you're ready, choose Assign Metric.


Provide a metric namespace and name, and ensure that the metric value is set to 1. When you're done, choose Create Filter.


In the navigation pane, choose Alarms, Create Alarm.


In the Custom Metrics section, choose the namespace for the metric filter that you created.


It can take a few minutes for a new metric to display in the console.


Select the metric name that you created, and choose Next.


Enter a name and description for the alarm. For the is fields, choose >= and enter 10. For the for field, leave the default 1 for the consecutive periods.


For Period, choose 1 Hour. For Statistic, choose Sum. The Sum statistic ensures that you are capturing the total number of data points for the specified time period. 


In the Actions section, you can choose to send a notification to an existing list. Or, you can create a new list and enter the email addresses that should receive a notification when the alarm is triggered. When you are done, choose Create Alarm.
