What is AWS Client VPN?
AWS Client VPN is a managed client-based VPN service that enables you to securely access AWS resources and resources in your on-premises network.
This guide provides steps for establishing a VPN connection to a Client VPN endpoint using a client application on your device.
Components
The following are the key components for using AWS Client VPN.
 Client VPN endpoint — Your Client VPN administrator creates and configures a Client VPN endpoint in AWS. Your administrator controls which networks and resources you can access when you establish a VPN connection.
 VPN client application — The software application that you use to connect to the Client VPN endpoint and establish a secure VPN connection.
 Client VPN endpoint configuration file — A configuration file that's provided to you by your Client VPN administrator. The file includes information about the Client VPN endpoint and the certificates required to establish a VPN connection. You load this file into your chosen VPN client application.
