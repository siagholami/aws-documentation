Image tag mutability
You can configure a repository to be immutable to prevent image tags from being overwritten. Once the repository is configured for immutable tags, an ImageTagAlreadyExistsException error will be returned if you attempt to push an image with a tag that already exists in the repository.
You can use the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI tools to set image tag mutability for either a new repository during creation or for an existing repository at any time. For console steps, see Creating a repository and Editing a repository.
To create a repository with immutable tags configured
Use one of the following commands to create a new image repository with immutable tags configured.
 create-repository (AWS CLI)
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name name --image-tag-mutability IMMUTABLE --region us-east-2
 New-ECRRepository (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)
New-ECRRepository -RepositoryName name -ImageTagMutability IMMUTABLE -Region us-east-2 -Force
To update the image tag mutability settings for an existing repository
Use one of the following commands to update the image tag mutability settings for an existing repository.
 put-image-tag-mutability (AWS CLI)
aws ecr put-image-tag-mutability --repository-name name --image-tag-mutability IMMUTABLE --region us-east-2
 Write-ECRImageTagMutability (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)
Write-ECRImageTagMutability -RepositoryName name -ImageTagMutability IMMUTABLE -Region us-east-2 -Force
