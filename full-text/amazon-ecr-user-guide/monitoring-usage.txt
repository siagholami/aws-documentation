Amazon ECR usage metrics
You can use CloudWatch usage metrics to provide visibility into your account's usage of resources. Use these metrics to visualize your current service usage on CloudWatch graphs and dashboards.
Amazon ECR usage metrics correspond to AWS service quotas. You can configure alarms that alert you when your usage approaches a service quota. For more information about Amazon ECR service quotas, see Amazon ECR service quotas.
Amazon ECR publishes the following metrics in the AWS/Usage namespace.
