Step 3: Run and Verify the Code
To run the Java test harness for the Java Producer library, do the following.


Choose DemoAppMain.


Choose Run, Run 'DemoAppMain'.


Add your credentials to the JVM arguments for the application:
    For non-temporary AWS credentials: "-Daws.accessKeyId={YourAwsAccessKey} -Daws.secretKey={YourAwsSecretKey} -Djava.library.path={NativeLibraryPath}" 
    For temporary AWS credentials: "-Daws.accessKeyId={YourAwsAccessKey} -Daws.secretKey={YourAwsSecretKey} -Daws.sessionToken={YourAwsSessionToken} -Djava.library.path={NativeLibraryPath}" 


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Kinesis Video Streams console. 


On the Manage Streams page, choose your stream.

The sample video will play in the embedded player. You might need to wait a short time (up to ten seconds under typical bandwidth and processor conditions) while the frames accumulate before the video appears.

The code example creates a stream. As the MediaSource in the code starts, it begins sending sample frames to the KinesisVideoClient. The client then sends the data to your Kinesis video stream.
