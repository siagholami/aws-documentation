Step 3: Run and Verify the Code
To run the Android example application for the Android Producer Library, do the following.


Connect to an Android device.


Choose Run, Run..., and choose Edit configurations....


Choose , Android App. In the Name field, enter AmazonKinesisVideoDemoApp. In the Module pulldown, choose AmazonKinesisVideoDemoApp. Choose OK.


Choose Run, Run.


In the Select Deployment Target screen, choose your connected device, and choose OK.


In the AWSKinesisVideoDemoApp application on the device, choose Create new account.


Enter values for USERNAME*, Password, Given name, Email address, and Phone number, and then choose Sign up.
Note
These values have the following constraints:
Password: Must contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. You can change these constraints in your User pool page on the Amazon Cognito console. 
Email address: Must be a valid address so that you can receive a confirmation code.
Phone number: Must be in the following format: *, for example, 12065551212 .


Enter the code you receive by email, and choose Confirm. Choose Ok.


On the next page, leave the default values, and choose Stream.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Kinesis Video Streams console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideo/ in the US West (Oregon) Region. 


On the Manage Streams page, choose demo-stream. 

The streaming video plays in the embedded player. You might need to wait a short time (up to ten seconds under typical bandwidth and processor conditions) while the frames accumulate before the video appears.
Note
If the device's screen rotates (for example, from portrait to landscape), the application stops streaming video.

The code example creates a stream. As the MediaSource in the code starts, it begins sending frames from the camera to the KinesisVideoClient. The client then sends the data to a Kinesis video stream named demo-stream.
