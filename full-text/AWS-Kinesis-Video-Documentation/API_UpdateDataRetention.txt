UpdateDataRetention
Increases or decreases the stream's data retention period by the value that you specify. To indicate whether you want to increase or decrease the data retention period, specify the Operation parameter in the request body. In the request, you must specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN. 
Note
The retention period that you specify replaces the current value.
This operation requires permission for the KinesisVideo:UpdateDataRetention action.
Changing the data retention period affects the data in the stream as follows:
 If the data retention period is increased, existing data is retained for the new retention period. For example, if the data retention period is increased from one hour to seven hours, all existing data is retained for seven hours.
 If the data retention period is decreased, existing data is retained for the new retention period. For example, if the data retention period is decreased from seven hours to one hour, all existing data is retained for one hour, and any data older than one hour is deleted immediately.
