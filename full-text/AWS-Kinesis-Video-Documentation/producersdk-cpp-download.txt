Step 1: Download and Configure the C Producer Library Code
In this section, you download the low-level libraries and configure the application to use your AWS credentials. 
For prerequisites and other details about this example, see Using the C Producer Library.

Create a directory, and then clone the example source code from the GitHub repository. 

git clone --recursive https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp.git
Note
If you don't run git clone with --recursive, run git submodule update --init in the amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/open-source directory. You must also install pkg-config, CMake, and a build enviroment. If you want to build the GStreamer plugin, you also have to install it locally.
For more information, see the README.md in https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp.

Open the code in the integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice (for example, Eclipse).
