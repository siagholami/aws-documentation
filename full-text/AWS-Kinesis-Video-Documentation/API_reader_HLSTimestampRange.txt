HLSTimestampRange
The start and end of the timestamp range for the requested media.
This value should not be present if PlaybackType is LIVE.
Note
The values in the HLSTimestampRange are inclusive. Fragments that begin before the start time but continue past it, or fragments that begin before the end time but continue past it, are included in the session.
Contents
EndTimestamp 
The end of the timestamp range for the requested media. This value must be within 3 hours of the specified StartTimestamp, and it must be later than the StartTimestamp value.
If FragmentSelectorType for the request is SERVER_TIMESTAMP, this value must be in the past.
The EndTimestamp value is required for ON_DEMAND mode, but optional for LIVE_REPLAY mode. If the EndTimestamp is not set for LIVE_REPLAY mode then the session will continue to include newly ingested fragments until the session expires.
This value is inclusive. The EndTimestamp is compared to the (starting) timestamp of the fragment. Fragments that start before the EndTimestamp value and continue past it are included in the session.
