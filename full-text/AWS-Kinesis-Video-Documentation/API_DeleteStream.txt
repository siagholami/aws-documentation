DeleteStream
Deletes a Kinesis video stream and the data contained in the stream. 
This method marks the stream for deletion, and makes the data in the stream inaccessible immediately.
To ensure that you have the latest version of the stream before deleting it, you can specify the stream version. Kinesis Video Streams assigns a version to each stream. When you update a stream, Kinesis Video Streams assigns a new version number. To get the latest stream version, use the DescribeStream API. 
This operation requires permission for the KinesisVideo:DeleteStream action.
