TagResource
Adds one or more tags to a signaling channel. A tag is a key-value pair (the value is optional) that you can define and assign to AWS resources. If you specify a tag that already exists, the tag value is replaced with the value that you specify in the request. For more information, see Using Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
