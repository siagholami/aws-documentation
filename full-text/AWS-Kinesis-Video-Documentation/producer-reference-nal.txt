Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) Adaptation Flag Reference
This section contains information about available flags for the StreamInfo.NalAdaptationFlags enumeration.
The elementary stream in an application can be in either Annex-B or AVCC format: 
 The Annex-B format delimits NALUs (Network Abstraction Layer units) with two bytes of zeroes, followed by one or three bytes of zeroes, followed by the number 1 (called a start code, for example, 00000001). 
 The AVCC format also wraps NALUs, but each NALU is preceded by a value that indicates the size of the NALU (usually four bytes).
Many encoders produce the Annex-B bitstream format. Some higher-level bitstream processors (such as a playback engine or the Media Source Extensions (MSE) player in the AWS Management Console) use the AVCC format for their frames.
The codec private data (CPD), which is SPS/PPS (Sequence Parameter Set/Picture Parameter Set) for the H.264 codec, can also be in Annex-B or AVCC format. However, for the CPD, the formats are different from those described previously.
The flags tell the SDK to adapt the NALUs to AVCC or Annex-B for frame data and CPD as follows: 




Flag
Adaptation




NAL_ADAPTATION_FLAG_NONE
No adaptation


NAL_ADAPTATION_ANNEXB_NALS
Adapt Annex-B NALUs to AVCC NALUs


NAL_ADAPTATION_AVCC_NALS
Adapt AVCC NALUs to Annex-B NALUs


NAL_ADAPTATION_ANNEXB_CPD_NALS
Adapt Annex-B NALUs for the codec private data to AVCC format NALUs


NAL_ADAPTATION_ANNEXB_CPD_AND_FRAME_NALS
Adapt Annex-B NALUs for the codec and frame private data to AVCC format NALUs
