FragmentSelector
Describes the timestamp range and timestamp origin of a range of fragments.
Only fragments with a start timestamp greater than or equal to the given start time and less than or equal to the end time are returned. For example, if a stream contains fragments with the following start timestamps: 
 00:00:00
 00:00:02
 00:00:04
 00:00:06
A fragment selector range with a start time of 00:00:01 and end time of 00:00:04 would return the fragments with start times of 00:00:02 and 00:00:04.
