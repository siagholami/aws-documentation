Saving and sharing your estimate
You can save each estimate's unique link to share or revisit directly through your browser. Estimates are saved to AWS public servers.
Any changes that you make to an estimate requires you to save again. AWS Pricing Calculator doesn't save automatically.
Each time that you save an estimate, the system generates a unique link. If you don't copy and save the newly generated link, you can't access any saved changes.
