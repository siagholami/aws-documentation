What is AWS Pricing Calculator?
AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS. You can plan your AWS costs and usage or price out setting up a new set of instances and services. 
AWS Pricing Calculator is useful both for people who have never used AWS and for users who want to reorganize or expand their AWS usage. You don't need any experience with the cloud or AWS to use AWS Pricing Calculator.
