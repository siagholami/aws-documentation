Service Quotas and Amazon CloudWatch Alarms
You can create Amazon CloudWatch alarms on the Service Quotas console to notify you when you're close to a quota value threshold. Setting an alarm can help you know if you need to request a quota increase.
To create a CloudWatch alarm for a quota


Open the Service Quotas console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/.


In the navigation pane, choose AWS services and then select a service.


Select a quota that supports CloudWatch alarms.


If you have utilization, it appears beneath the quota description. The CloudWatch alarms section appears at the bottom of the page.


In Amazon CloudWatch alarms, choose Create.


For Alarm threshold, choose a threshold.


For Alarm name, enter a name for the alarm. This name must be unique within the AWS account.


Choose Create.


To add a notification to the CloudWatch alarm, see Creating a CloudWatch Alarm Based on a CloudWatch Metric in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
