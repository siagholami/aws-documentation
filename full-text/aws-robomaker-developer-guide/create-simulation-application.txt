Creating a Simulation Application
Create a simulation application to use in simulation jobs.
To create a simulation application
Follow the steps under one of the following tabs.
Note
Amazon S3 objects must be located in the same Region as AWS RoboMaker.

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Development, and then choose simulation applications.


Type a name for the application. Choose a name that helps you identify the simulation. For example, Outdoor v2.


Select the ROS distribution used by your robot application. For more information about ROS, see www.ros.org. 


Select the Simulation software suite used by your simulation application. For more information about ROS, see www.ros.org. 


Select the Simulation rendering engine used by your simulation application. 


Provide the Amazon S3 path to your bundled simulation application file built for the X86_64 platform. 


(Optional) select Create new S3 folder to go to the Amazon Simple Storage Service console. There, you can create and manage buckets.

(Optional) Under Tags, specify one or more tags for the simulation application. Tags are words or phrases that act as metadata to identify your AWS resources. Each tag consists of a key and a value. You can manage tags for your simulation on the Simulation application details page.

For more about tagging, see Tagging Your AWS RoboMaker Resources. 

Choose Create.


[ Using the AWS CLI ]
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based create simulation application on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker create-simulation-application \
--name HelloWorldSimulationApplication \
--rendering-engine name=OGRE,version=1.x \
--simulation-software-suite name=Gazebo,version=7 \
--robot-software-suite name=ROS,version=Melodic \
--sources architecture=X86_64,s3Bucket=my-bucket-name,s3Key=my-key-name/hello-world-simulation.tar
