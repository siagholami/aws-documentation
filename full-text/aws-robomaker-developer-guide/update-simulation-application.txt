Updating a Simulation Application
Update a simulation application.
To update a simulation application
Follow the steps under one of the following tabs.

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Development, then choose Simulation applications.


Check the box next to the simulation application you want to update.


Select Actions, then select Update.


You can add or remove sources, but you must have at least one source simulation application file.


Select Update to update the simulation application.



[ Using the AWS CLI ]
You can use the following commands to update a simulation application:
 API/SDK: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/latest/dg/API_UpdateSimulationApplication.html
 AWS CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/robomaker/update-simulation-application.html
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based update simulation application on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker update-simulation-application \
--application my-robot-application-arn \
--rendering-engine name=OGRE,version=1.x \
--simulation-software-suite name=Gazebo,version=7 \
--sources architecture=X86_64,s3Bucket=my-bucket-name,s3Key=my-key-name/hello-world-simulation.tar
