Environment Variables Created by AWS RoboMaker
AWS RoboMaker defines these simulation job environment variables.
 AWS_ROBOMAKER_SIMULATION_JOB_ID
 AWS_ROBOMAKER_SIMULATION_JOB_ARN
 AWS_ROBOMAKER_SIMULATION_RUN_ID
You can get these variables from your application or from the command line. For example, to get the current simulation job Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in Python, use os.environ.get("AWS_ROBOMAKER_SIMULATION_JOB_ARN"). 
If you specified an Amazon Simple Storage Service output bucket for the simulation job, you can use the environment variables to find the output path. AWS RoboMaker writes output to s3://bucket-name/AWS_ROBOMAKER_SIMULATION_JOB_ID/AWS_ROBOMAKER_SIMULATION_RUN_ID. Use this to manage objects in Amazon S3 from code or the command line.
