Cancelling a Simulation Job
A simulation job can be cancelled if it is running and no longer needed.
To cancel a simulation job
Follow the steps under one of the following tabs:

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Simulations, then choose Simulation jobs.


Select the Id of the simulation job you want to cancel.


In the Simulation job detail page, under Actions, choose Cancel.


In the Cancel simulation job page, select Yes, cancel.



[ Using the AWS CLI ]
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based cancel simulation job on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker list-simulation-jobs
$ aws robomaker cancel-simulation-job --job my-simulation-job-arn
