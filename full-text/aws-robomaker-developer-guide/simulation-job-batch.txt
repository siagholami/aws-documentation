Managing Simulation Job Batches
This section provides information about how you can start and manage simulation job batches. Using a simulation job batch, you can launch and run many simulations using a single API call. This makes it easy to perform regression testing, parameter optimization, machine learning model training, and synthetic data generation. 
Note
Simulation job batches can only be started using the AWS RoboMaker SDK or AWS CLI. You can view, clone, and cancel simulation batches using the AWS RoboMaker console.
