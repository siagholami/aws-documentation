Working with Simulation Applications
An AWS RoboMaker simulation application includes information about its dependencies. It includes the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location of a simulation application bundle for the X86_64 architecture. It also includes the name and version of the Robot Operating System (ROS) distribution and the rendering engine used. 
Join the simulation with an AWS RoboMaker robot application in a simulation job to interact with your robot. Interact with tools like Gazebo and develop simulation and test data.
