Developing with AWS Cloud9
You can create an AWS Cloud9 development environment for AWS RoboMaker and robotics development. The environment is preconfigured with ROS and integrated with other AWS RoboMaker capabilities. With it, you can manage build configurations, create simulation jobs, and explore running simulations with Gazebo, rviz, rqt and a terminal. 
You access the AWS Cloud9 development environment through a web browser.
