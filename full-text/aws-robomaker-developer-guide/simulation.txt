Running Simulation Jobs
An AWS RoboMaker simulation job is a pairing of a robot application and a simulation application running in the cloud. While the simulation job is running, you can interact with it using simulation tools like Gazebo, rviz, rqt and a terminal to visualize sensor data or control components of the robot.
