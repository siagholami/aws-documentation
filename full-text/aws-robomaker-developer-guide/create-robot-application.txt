Creating a Robot Application
Create a robot application to use in a simulation job. When it is ready to deploy to robot hardware, you can add it to a fleet and then deploy to the fleet.
To create a robot application
Follow the steps under one of the following tabs.
Note
Amazon S3 objects must be located in the same region as AWS RoboMaker.

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/robomaker/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/).


In the left pane, choose Development, and then choose Robot applications.


Select Create robot application.


In the Create robot application page, type a Name for the robot application. Choose a name that helps you identify the robot.


Select the ROS distribution used by your robot application. For more information about the Robot Operating System (ROS), see www.ros.org. 


Provide the Amazon S3 path to your bundled robot application file. If this robot application is used only in simulations, specify a bundle built for the X86_64 platform. If you use this robot application in a fleet deployment, specify one or more bundles that represent the architectures of the robots in your fleet. 


Optionally, choose Create new S3 folder to go to the Amazon Simple Storage Service AWS Management Console to create and manage buckets.

Optionally, under Tags, specify one or more tags for the simulation application. Tags are words or phrases that act as metadata for identifying and organizing your AWS resources. Each tag consists of a key and a value. You can manage tags for your simulation application on the Simulation application details page.

For more about tagging, see Tagging Your AWS RoboMaker Resources. 

Choose Create.


[ Using the AWS CLI ]
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based create robot application on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker create-robot-application --application my-robot-application --robot-software-suite name=ROS,version=Melodic --sources architecture=X86_64,s3Bucket=my-bucket,s3Key=my-folder/cloud-watch-robot.tar
