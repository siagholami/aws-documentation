Working with Robot Applications
An AWS RoboMaker robot application includes one or more Amazon S3 locations with robot application bundles. The Amazon S3 resources include the ROS distribution used by the robot application. 
Your robot application can be paired with a simulation application. This is called a simulation job. You can also deploy your application to physical robots.
