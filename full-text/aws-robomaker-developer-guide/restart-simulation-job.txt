Restarting a Simulation Job
Running simulation jobs can be restarted. When restarted, the simulation job will use the robot application and simulation application source files in the Amazon S3 location and all other configuration settings specified when the simulation job was created.
To restart a simulation job
Follow the steps under one of the following tabs:

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Simulations, then choose Simulation jobs.


Select the Id of a running simulation job you would like to restart.


In the Simulation job detail page, under Actions, choose Restart.


In the Restart simulation job page, select Yes, restart.



[ Using the AWS CLI ]
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based restart simulation job on the other tab. The simulation job must be running.  
$ aws robomaker restart-simulation-job --job my-simulation-job-arn
