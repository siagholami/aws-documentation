In the left navigation pane, choose Simulations, then choose Simulation job batches.


Select the Id of the simulation job batch you want to clone.


To clone the entire batch, in the Simulation job batch detail page, under Batch actions, choose Clone batch. 


Ti clone specific simulation job requests from the batch, under Simulation job requests, check the simulation job requests you want to clone, then select Request actions and choose Clone request.
