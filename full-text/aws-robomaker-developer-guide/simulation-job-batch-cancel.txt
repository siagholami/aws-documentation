Cancelling a Simulation Job Batch
A simulation job can be cancelled if it is running and no longer needed.
To cancel a simulation job
Follow the steps under one of the following tabs:

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Simulations, then choose Simulation job batches.


Select the Id of the simulation job batch you want to cancel.


In the Simulation job batch detail page, under Batch actions, choose Cancel batch.


In the Cancel simulation job batch page, select Cancel. 



[ Using the AWS CLI ]
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based cancel simulation job batch on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker list-simulation-job-batches
$ aws robomaker cancel-simulation-job-batch --job my-simulation-job-batch-arn
