Traffic Mirror Targets
A target is the destination for a traffic mirror session.
The traffic mirror target can be an elastic network interface, or a Network Load Balancer. After you create a target, assign it to a traffic mirror session. For more information, see Create a Traffic Mirror Session.
You must configure a security group for the traffic mirror target that allows VXLAN traffic from the source to the target.
You can share a traffic mirror target across accounts. To share a traffic mirror target, create the target, and then share the target. For more information, see Sharing a Traffic Mirror Target.
