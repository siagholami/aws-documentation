Example: Mirror Inbound TCP Traffic to a Single Monitoring Appliance
Consider the scenario where you want to mirror inbound TCP traffic on an instance, and send it to a single monitoring appliance. You need the following traffic mirror resources for this example:
 A traffic mirror target for the appliance (Target A)
 A traffic mirror filter with a traffic mirror rule for the TCP inbound traffic (Filter 1)
 A traffic mirror session that has the following:
   A traffic mirror source
   A traffic mirror target for the appliance
   A traffic mirror filter with a traffic mirror rule for the TCP inbound traffic
Step 1: Create a Traffic Mirror Target
Create a traffic mirror target (Target A) for the monitoring appliance. Depending on your configuration, the target is one of the following types:
 The network interface of the monitoring appliance
 The Network Load Balancer when the appliance is deployed behind one
For more information, see Create a Traffic Mirror Target.
Step 2: Create a Traffic Mirror Filter
Create a traffic mirror filter (Filter 1) that has the following inbound rule. For more information, see Create a Traffic Mirror Filter.
