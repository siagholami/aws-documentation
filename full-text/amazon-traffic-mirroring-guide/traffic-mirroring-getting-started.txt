Getting Started with Traffic Mirroring
The following tasks help you to become familiar with traffic mirror targets, filters, and sessions. Follow the instructions to create a traffic mirror target and filter, and then use those resources to create a session.

 Step 3: Create the Traffic Mirror Session
Prerequisites

Make sure that the traffic mirror source and traffic mirror target are either: 
In the same VPC, or
In different VPCs that are connected via VPC peering or a transit gateway.
Make sure that the traffic mirror target instance allows traffic to UDP port 4789.
Make sure that the traffic mirror source has a route table entry for the traffic mirror target.
Make sure that there are no security group rules or network ACL rules on the traffic mirror target that drop the mirrored traffic from the traffic mirror source.
Review the Traffic Mirroring considerations. For more information, see Traffic Mirroring Service Quotas and Considerations.

Step 1: Create the Traffic Mirror Target
Create a destination for mirrored traffic.
Create a traffic mirror target


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the Region selector, choose the AWS Region that you used when you created the VPCs.


On the navigation pane, choose Traffic Mirroring, Mirror Targets.


Choose Create Traffic Mirror Target.


For Name tag, enter a name for the traffic mirror target.


(Optional) For Description, enter a description for the traffic mirror target.


For Target type, choose the traffic mirror target type.


For Target, choose the traffic mirror target.


(Optional) Add or remove a tag.


[Add a tag] Choose Add tag and do the following:
    For Key, enter the key name.
    For Value, enter the key value.
[Remove a tag] Next to the tag, choose Remove tag.

Choose Create.

Step 2: Create the Traffic Mirror Filter
A traffic mirror filter contains one or more traffic mirror rules, and a set of network services. The filters and rules that you add define the traffic that is mirrored. 
To create a traffic mirror filter


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the Region selector, choose the AWS Region that you used when you created the VPCs.


On the navigation pane, choose Traffic Mirroring, Mirror Filters.


Choose Create traffic mirror filter.


For Name tag, enter a name for the traffic mirror filter.


(Optional) For Description, enter a description for the traffic mirror filter.


(Optional) Mirror network services.


[Mirror Amazon DNS traffic] Select amazon-dns.


(Optional) Add inbound rules. Under Inbound rules, choose Add, rule, and then specify the following information about the traffic mirror source inbound traffic:
    Rule Number: Enter a priority to assign to the rule.
    Rule action: Choose the action to take for the packet.
    Protocol: Choose the L4 protocol to assign to the rule.
    (Optional) Source port range: Enter the source port range.
    (Optional) Destination port range: Enter the destination port range.
    Source CIDR block: Enter a source CIDR block.
    Destination CIDR block: Enter a destination CIDR block.
    (Optional) Description: Enter a description for the rule.
Repeat for each inbound rule that you want to add.


(Optional) Add outbound rules. Under Outbound rules, choose Add, rule, and then specify the following information about the traffic mirror source outbound traffic:
    Rule number: Enter a priority to assign to the rule.
    Rule action: Choose the action to take for the packet.
    Protocol: Choose the IP protocol to assign to the rule.
     (Optional) Source port range: Enter the source port range.
    (Optional) Destination port range: Enter the destination port range.
     Source CIDR block: Enter a source CIDR block.
    Destination CIDR block: Enter a destination CIDR block.
    (Optional) Description: Enter a description for the rule.
Repeat for each outbound rule that you want to add.


(Optional) Add or remove a tag.


[Add a tag] Choose Add tag and do the following:
    For Key, enter the key name.
    For Value, enter the key value.
[Remove a tag] Next to the tag, choose Remove tag.

Choose Create.

Step 3: Create the Traffic Mirror Session
Create a traffic mirror session that sends mirrored packets from the source to a target so that you can monitor and analyze traffic.
To create a traffic mirror session


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the Region selector, choose the AWS Region that you used when you created the VPCs.


In the navigation pane, choose Traffic Mirroring, Mirror Sessions.


Choose Create traffic mirror session.


(Optional) For Name tag, enter a name for the traffic mirror session.


(Optional) For Description, enter a description for the traffic mirror session.


For Mirror source, choose the network interface of the instance that you want to monitor. 


For Mirror target, choose the traffic mirror target.


Under Additional settings, do the following:


For Session number, enter the session number.
The session number determines the order that traffic mirror sessions are evaluated in both of the following situations:
   When an interface is used by multiple sessions.
   When an interface is used by different traffic mirror targets and traffic mirror filters.
Traffic is only mirrored one time.
Use 1 for the highest priority.
Valid values are 1-32766.


(Optional) For VNI, enter the VXLAN ID to use for the traffic mirror session. For more information about the VXLAN protocol, see RFC 7348.
If you do not enter a value, we assign a random unused number.


(Optional) For Packet Length, enter the number of bytes in each packet to mirror.
If you do not want to mirror the entire packet, set Packet Length to the number of bytes in each packet to mirror. For example, if you set this value to 100, the first 100 bytes after the VXLAN header that meet the filter criteria are copied to the target.
To mirror the entire packet, do not enter a value in this field.


For Filter, choose the traffic mirror filter that determines what traffic gets mirrored.


(Optional) Add or remove a tag.


[Add a tag] Choose Add tag and do the following:
    For Key, enter the key name.
    For Value, enter the key value.
[Remove a tag] Next to the tag, choose Remove tag.

Choose Create.
