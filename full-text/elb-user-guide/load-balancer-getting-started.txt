Getting started with Elastic Load Balancing
There are three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. You can select a load balancer based on your application needs. For more information, see Comparison of Elastic Load Balancing products.
For demos of common load balancer configurations, see Elastic Load Balancing demos.
If you have an existing Classic Load Balancer, you can migrate to an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer. For more information, see Migrate your Classic Load Balancer.
