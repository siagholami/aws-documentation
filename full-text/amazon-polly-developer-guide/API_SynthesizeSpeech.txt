SynthesizeSpeech
Synthesizes UTF-8 input, plain text or SSML, to a stream of bytes. SSML input must be valid, well-formed SSML. Some alphabets might not be available with all the voices (for example, Cyrillic might not be read at all by English voices) unless phoneme mapping is used. For more information, see How it Works.

The response returns the following HTTP headers.
 ContentType  
 Specifies the type audio stream. This should reflect the OutputFormat parameter in your request.   


If you request mp3 as the OutputFormat, the ContentType returned is audio/mpeg. 


If you request ogg_vorbis as the OutputFormat, the ContentType returned is audio/ogg. 


If you request pcm as the OutputFormat, the ContentType returned is audio/pcm in a signed 16-bit, 1 channel (mono), little-endian format. 


If you request json as the OutputFormat, the ContentType returned is audio/json.


 RequestCharacters  
Number of characters synthesized.
The response returns the following as the HTTP body.
 AudioStream  
 Stream containing the synthesized speech. 
Errors
InvalidSampleRateException 
The specified sample rate is not valid.
HTTP Status Code: 400
InvalidSsmlException 
The SSML you provided is invalid. Verify the SSML syntax, spelling of tags and values, and then try again.
HTTP Status Code: 400
LexiconNotFoundException
