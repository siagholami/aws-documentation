Executions
A state machine execution occurs when an AWS Step Functions state machine runs and performs its tasks. Each Step Functions state machine can have multiple simultaneous executions, which you can initiate from the Step Functions console, or by using the AWS SDKs, the Step Functions API actions, or the AWS CLI. An execution receives JSON input and produces JSON output. You can start a Step Functions execution in the following ways.
 Call the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/apireference/API_StartExecution.html API action.
 Start a new execution in the Step Functions console.
 Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to start an execution.
 Start an execution with Amazon API Gateway.
 Start a nested workflow execution from a Task state.
