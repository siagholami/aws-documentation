Sample Projects
In the AWS Step Functions console, you can choose one of the following state machine sample projects to automatically create the state machine Code, Visual Workflow, and all related AWS resources for the project. 
Each of the sample projects provisions a fully functional state machine, and creates the related resources for it to run. When you create a sample project, Step Functions uses AWS CloudFormation to create the related resources referenced by the state machine.
