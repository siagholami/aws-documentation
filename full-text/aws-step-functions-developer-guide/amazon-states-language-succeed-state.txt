Succeed
A Succeed state ("Type": "Succeed") stops an execution successfully. The Succeed state is a useful target for Choice state branches that don't do anything but stop the execution.
Because Succeed states are terminal states, they have no Next field, and don't need an End field, for example:
"SuccessState": {
  "Type": "Succeed"
}
