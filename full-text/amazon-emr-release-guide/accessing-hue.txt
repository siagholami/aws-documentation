Launching the Hue Web Interface
Launching Hue is the same as connecting to any HTTP interface hosted on the master node of a cluster. The following procedure describes how to access the Hue interface. For more information, see View Web Interfaces Hosted on EMR Clusters in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
To launch the Hue web interface


Follow these instructions to Set Up an SSH TUnnel to the Master Node Using Dynamic Port Forwarding in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.


Type the following address in your browser to open the Hue web interface: http://master public DNS:8888 where master public dns is the public DNS name of your cluster master node, for example ec2-11-22-333-44.compute-1.amazonaws.com.


At the Hue login screen, if you are the administrator logging in for the first time, enter a user name and password to create your Hue superuser account and then select Create account. Otherwise, type your username and password and select Create account or enter the credentials provided by your administrator.
