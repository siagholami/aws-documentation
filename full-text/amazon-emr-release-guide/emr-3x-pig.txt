Pig Application Specifics for Earlier AMI Versions of Amazon EMR
Supported Pig Versions
The Pig version you can add to your cluster depends on the version of the Amazon EMR AMI and the version of Hadoop you are using. The table below shows which AMI versions and versions of Hadoop are compatible with the different versions of Pig. We recommend using the latest available version of Pig to take advantage of performance enhancements and new functionality. 
When you use the API to install Pig, the default version is used unless you specify --pig-versions as an argument to the step that loads Pig onto the cluster during the call to RunJobFlow.

Pig Version Details
Amazon EMR supports certain Pig releases that might have additional Amazon EMR patches applied. You can configure which version of Pig to run on Amazon EMR clusters. For more information about how to do this, see Apache Pig. The following sections describe different Pig versions and the patches applied to the versions loaded on Amazon EMR.

Patch
Description




Support JAR files and Pig scripts in dfs
Add support for running scripts and registering JAR files stored in HDFS, Amazon S3, or other distributed file systems. For more information, go to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1505.   Status: Committed   Fixed in Apache Pig Version: 0.8.0

Interactive and Batch Pig Clusters
Amazon EMR enables you to run Pig scripts in two modes:
 Interactive
 Batch
When you launch a long-running cluster using the console or the AWS CLI, you can connect using ssh into the master node as the Hadoop user and use the Grunt shell to develop and run your Pig scripts interactively. Using Pig interactively enables you to revise the Pig script more easily than batch mode. After you successfully revise the Pig script in interactive mode, you can upload the script to Amazon S3 and use batch mode to run the script in production. You can also submit Pig commands interactively on a running cluster to analyze and transform data as needed.
In batch mode, you upload your Pig script to Amazon S3, and then submit the work to the cluster as a step. Pig steps can be submitted to a long-running cluster or a transient cluster.
