Apache HCatalog
HCatalog is a tool that allows you to access Hive metastore tables within Pig, Spark SQL, and/or custom MapReduce applications. HCatalog has a REST interface and command line client that allows you to create tables or do other operations. You then write your applications to access the tables using HCatalog libraries.
