Differences and Considerations for Hive on Amazon EMR
Differences between Apache Hive on Amazon EMR and Apache Hive
This section describes the differences between Hive on Amazon EMR and the default versions of Hive available at http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hive/branches/. 
Hive Authorization
Amazon EMR supports Hive Authorization for HDFS but not for EMRFS and Amazon S3. Amazon EMR clusters run with authorization disabled by default.
Hive File Merge Behavior with Amazon S3
Apache Hive merges small files at the end of a map-only job if hive.merge.mapfiles is true and the merge is triggered only if the average output size of the job is less than the hive.merge.smallfiles.avgsize setting. Amazon EMR Hive has exactly the same behavior if the final output path is in HDFS. If the output path is in Amazon S3, the hive.merge.smallfiles.avgsize parameter is ignored. In that situation, the merge task is always triggered if hive.merge.mapfiles is set to true.
ACID Transactions and Amazon S3
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions are not supported with Hive data stored in Amazon S3. Trying to create a transactional table in Amazon S3 causes an exception. 
Hive Live Long and Process (LLAP)
LLAP functionality added in version 2.0 of default Apache Hive is not supported in Hive 2.1.0 on Amazon EMR release 5.0.
Differences in Hive Between Amazon EMR Release Version 4.x and 5.x
This section covers differences to consider before you migrate a Hive implementation from Hive version 1.0.0 on Amazon EMR release 4.x to Hive 2.x on Amazon EMR release 5.x.
Operational Differences and Considerations

Support added for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability)transactions: This difference between Hive 1.0.0 on Amazon EMR 4.x and default Apache Hive has been eliminated.
Direct writes to Amazon S3 eliminated: This difference between Hive 1.0.0 on Amazon EMR and the default Apache Hive has been eliminated. Hive 2.1.0 on Amazon EMR release 5.x now creates, reads from, and writes to temporary files stored in Amazon S3. As a result, to read from and write to the same table you no longer have to create a temporary table in the cluster's local HDFS file system as a workaround. If you use versioned buckets, be sure to manage these temporary files as described below.
Manage temp files when using Amazon S3 versioned buckets: When you run Hive queries where the destination of generated data is Amazon S3, many temporary files and directories are created. This is new behavior as described earlier. If you use versioned S3 buckets, these temp files clutter Amazon S3 and incur cost if they're not deleted. Adjust your lifecycle rules so that data with a /_tmp prefix is deleted after a short period, such as five days. See Specifying a Lifecycle Configuration for more information.
Log4j updated to log4j 2: If you use log4j, you may need to change your logging configuration because of this upgrade. See Apache log4j 2 for details.

Performance differences and considerations

Performance differences with Tez: With Amazon EMR release 5.x , Tez is the default execution engine for Hive instead of MapReduce. Tez provides improved performance for most workflows.
ORC file performance: Query performance may be slower than expected for ORC files.
Tables with many partitions: Queries that generate a large number of dynamic partitions may fail, and queries that select from tables with many partitions may take longer than expected to execute. For example, a select from 100,000 partitions may take 10 minutes or more.

Additional Features of Hive on Amazon EMR
Amazon EMR extends Hive with new features that support Hive integration with other AWS services, such as the ability to read from and write to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and DynamoDB.
Variables in Hive
You can include variables in your scripts by using the dollar sign and curly braces. 
add jar ${LIB}/jsonserde.jar
You pass the values of these variables to Hive on the command line using the -d parameter, as in the following example: 
-d LIB=s3://elasticmapreduce/samples/hive-ads/lib
You can also pass the values into steps that execute Hive scripts. 
To pass variable values into Hive steps using the console


Open the Amazon EMR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/.


Choose Create cluster.


In the Steps section, for Add Step, choose Hive Program from the list and Configure and add.


In the Add Step dialog, specify the parameters using the following table as a guide, and then choose Add.   
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Select values as necessary and choose Create cluster.


To pass variable values into Hive steps using the AWS CLI
To pass variable values into Hive steps using the AWS CLI, use the --steps parameter and include an arguments list.
 
Note
Linux line continuation characters (\) are included for readability. They can be removed or used in Linux commands. For Windows, remove them or replace with a caret (^).

For more information on using Amazon EMR commands in the AWS CLI, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr.
To pass variable values into Hive steps using the Java SDK
 The following example demonstrates how to pass variables into steps using the SDK. For more information, see Class StepFactory in the AWS SDK for Java API Reference. 
```
  StepFactory stepFactory = new StepFactory();
 StepConfig runHive = new StepConfig()
   .withName("Run Hive Script")
   .withActionOnFailure("TERMINATE_JOB_FLOW")
   .withHadoopJarStep(stepFactory.newRunHiveScriptStep(“s3://mybucket/script.q”,
    Lists.newArrayList(“-d”,”LIB= s3://elasticmapreduce/samples/hive-ads/lib”));

```
Amazon EMR Hive Queries to Accommodate Partial DynamoDB Schemas
Amazon EMR Hive provides maximum flexibility when querying DynamoDB tables by allowing you to specify a subset of columns on which you can filter data, rather than requiring your query to include all columns. This partial schema query technique is effective when you have a sparse database schema and want to filter records based on a few columns, such as filtering on time stamps. 
The following example shows how to use a Hive query to: 
 Create a DynamoDB table.
 Select a subset of items (rows) in DynamoDB and further narrow the data to certain columns.
 Copy the resulting data to Amazon S3. 
```
DROP TABLE dynamodb; 
DROP TABLE s3;
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dynamodb(hashKey STRING, recordTimeStamp BIGINT, fullColumn map)
    STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.dynamodb.DynamoDBStorageHandler' 
    TBLPROPERTIES ( 
     "dynamodb.table.name" = "myTable",
     "dynamodb.throughput.read.percent" = ".1000", 
     "dynamodb.column.mapping" = "hashKey:HashKey,recordTimeStamp:RangeKey"); 
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE s3(map)
     ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
     LOCATION 's3://bucketname/path/subpath/';
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE s3 SELECT item fullColumn FROM dynamodb WHERE recordTimeStamp < "2012-01-01";
```
The following table shows the query syntax for selecting any combination of items from DynamoDB.



Query example
Result description




SELECT * FROM table_name;
Selects all items (rows) from a given table and includes data from all columns available for those items.


SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE field_name =value;
Selects some items (rows) from a given table and includes data from all columns available for those items.


SELECT column1_name, column2_name, column3_name FROM table_name;
Selects all items (rows) from a given table and includes data from some columns available for those items.


SELECT column1_name, column2_name, column3_name FROM table_name WHERE field_name =value;
Selects some items (rows) from a given table and includes data from some columns available for those items.



Copy Data Between DynamoDB Tables in Different AWS Regions
Amazon EMR Hive provides a dynamodb.region property you can set per DynamoDB table. When dynamodb.region is set differently on two tables, any data you copy between the tables automatically occurs between the specified regions.
The following example shows you how to create a DynamoDB table with a Hive script that sets the dynamodb.region property:
Note
Per-table region properties override the global Hive properties.
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dynamodb(hashKey STRING, recordTimeStamp BIGINT, map<String, String> fullColumn)
    STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.dynamodb.DynamoDBStorageHandler' 
    TBLPROPERTIES ( 
     "dynamodb.table.name" = "myTable",
     "dynamodb.region" = "eu-west-1", 
     "dynamodb.throughput.read.percent" = ".1000", 
     "dynamodb.column.mapping" = "hashKey:HashKey,recordTimeStamp:RangeKey");
Set DynamoDB Throughput Values Per Table
Amazon EMR Hive enables you to set the DynamoDB readThroughputPercent and writeThroughputPercent settings on a per table basis in the table definition. The following Amazon EMR Hive script shows how to set the throughput values. For more information about DynamoDB throughput values, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements for Tables. 
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dynamodb(hashKey STRING, recordTimeStamp BIGINT, map<String, String> fullColumn)
    STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.dynamodb.DynamoDBStorageHandler' 
    TBLPROPERTIES ( 
     "dynamodb.table.name" = "myTable",
     "dynamodb.throughput.read.percent" = ".4",
     "dynamodb.throughput.write.percent" = "1.0",
     "dynamodb.column.mapping" = "hashKey:HashKey,recordTimeStamp:RangeKey");
