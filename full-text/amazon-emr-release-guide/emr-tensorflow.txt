Security
In addition to following the guidance in Using TensorFlow Securely we recommend that you launch your cluster in a private subnet to help you limit access to trusted sources. For more information, see Amazon VPC Options in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
Using TensorBoard
TensorBoard is a suite of visualization tools for TensorFlow programs. For more information, see TensorBoard: Visualized Learning on the Tensorflow website.
To use TensorBoard with Amazon EMR, you must start TensorBoard on the cluster master node.
To use Tensorboard with Tensorflow on Amazon EMR


Connect to the master node of the cluster using SSH. For more information, see Connect to the Master Node Using SSH in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.


Type the following command to start Tensorboard on the master node. Replace /my/log/directory with a directory on the master node where you have generated and stored summary data using a summary writer.


python3 -m tensorboard.main --logdir=/my/log/dir
By default, the master node hosts TensorBoard using port 6006 and the master public DNS name. After you start TensorBoard, the command line output presents the URL that can be used to connect to TensorBoard, as shown in the following example:
TensorBoard 1.9.0 at http://master-public-dns-name:6006 (Press CTRLC to quit)


Set up access to web interfaces on the master node from trusted clients. For more information, see View Web Interfaces Hosted on Amazon EMR Clusters in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.


Open TensorBoard at http://master-public-dns-name:6006.
