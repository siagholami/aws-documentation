Apache MXNet
Apache MXNet is an acceleration library designed for building neural networks and other deep learning applications. MXNet automates common work flows and optimizes numerical computations. MXNet helps you design neural network architectures without having to focus on implementing low-level computations, such as linear algebra operations. MXNet is included with Amazon EMR release version 5.10.0 and later.
