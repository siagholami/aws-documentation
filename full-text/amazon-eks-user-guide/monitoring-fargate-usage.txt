AWS Fargate usage metrics
You can use CloudWatch usage metrics to provide visibility into your accounts usage of resources. Use these metrics to visualize your current service usage on CloudWatch graphs and dashboards.
AWS Fargate usage metrics correspond to AWS service quotas. You can configure alarms that alert you when your usage approaches a service quota. For more information about Fargate service quotas, see Amazon EKS service quotas.
AWS Fargate publishes the following metrics in the AWS/Usage namespace.
