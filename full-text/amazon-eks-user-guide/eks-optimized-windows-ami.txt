Amazon EKS optimized Windows AMIs
The Amazon EKS optimized AMI is built on top of Windows Server 2019, and is configured to serve as the base image for Amazon EKS nodes. The AMI is configured to work with Amazon EKS out of the box, and it includes Docker,  kubelet  , and the AWS IAM Authenticator. 
Note
You can track security or privacy events for Windows Server with the Microsoft security update guide.
The AMI IDs for the latest Amazon EKS optimized AMI are shown in the following tables. Windows Server 2019 is a Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) release and Windows Server, versions 1909 and 2004 are Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) releases. For more information, see Windows Server servicing channels: LTSC and SAC in the Microsoft documentation. You can also retrieve the IDs with an AWS Systems Manager parameter using different tools. For more information, see Retrieving Amazon EKS optimized Windows AMI IDs.
