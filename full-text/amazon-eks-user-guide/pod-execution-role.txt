Pod execution role
The Amazon EKS pod execution role is required to run pods on AWS Fargate infrastructure.
When your cluster creates pods on AWS Fargate infrastructure, the pod needs to make calls to AWS APIs on your behalf, for example, to pull container images from Amazon ECR. The Amazon EKS pod execution role provides the IAM permissions to do this.
When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with your pods. This role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes Role based access control (RBAC) for authorization, so that the kubelet that is running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster. This is what allows Fargate infrastructure to appear in your cluster as nodes.
Before you create a Fargate profile, you must create an IAM role with the following IAM policy:
 [AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRolePolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRolePolicy%24jsonEditor)
Check for an existing pod execution role
You can use the following procedure to check and see if your account already has the Amazon EKS pod execution role.
To check for the AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRole in the IAM console


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
