Installing the Kubernetes Metrics Server
The Kubernetes Metrics Server is an aggregator of resource usage data in your cluster, and it is not deployed by default in Amazon EKS clusters. The Metrics Server is commonly used by other Kubernetes add ons, such as the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler or the Kubernetes Dashboard. For more information, see Resource metrics pipeline in the Kubernetes documentation. This topic explains how to deploy the Kubernetes Metrics Server on your Amazon EKS cluster.
To deploy the Metrics Server

Deploy the Metrics Server with the following command:

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/download/v0.3.6/components.yaml

Verify that the metrics-server deployment is running the desired number of pods with the following command.

kubectl get deployment metrics-server -n kube-system
Output
NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
