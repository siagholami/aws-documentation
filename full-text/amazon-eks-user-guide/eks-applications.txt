Applications
Your applications are deployed in containers, which are deployed in pods in Kubernetes. A pod includes one or more containers. Typically, one or more pods that provide the same service are deployed in a Kubernetes service. Once you've deployed multiple pods that provide the same service, you can:
 Vertically scale pods up or down with the Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler.
 Horizontally scale the number of pods needed to meet demand up or down with the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
 Create an external (for internet-accessible pods) or an internal (for private pods) load balancer to balance the traffic load across pods. The load balancer routes traffic at Layer 4 of the OSI model.
 Create an ALB Ingress Controller on Amazon EKS to balance the traffic load across pods. The application load balancer routes traffic at Layer 7 of the OSI model.
