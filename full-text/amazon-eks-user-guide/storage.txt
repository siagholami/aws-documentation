Storage
This chapter covers storage options for Amazon EKS clusters.
The Storage classes topic uses the in-tree Amazon EBS storage provisioner. The Amazon EBS CSI driver is available for managing storage in Kubernetes 1.14 and later clusters.
Note
The existing in-tree Amazon EBS plugin is still supported, but by using a CSI driver, you benefit from the decoupling of Kubernetes upstream release cycle and CSI driver release cycle. Eventually, the in-tree plugin will be deprecated in favor of the CSI driver.
