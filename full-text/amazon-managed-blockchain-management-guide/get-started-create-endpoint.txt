Step 2: Create and Configure the Interface VPC Endpoint
Now that the network is up and running in your VPC, you set up an interface VPC endpoint (AWS PrivateLink) for your member. This allows the Amazon EC2 instance that you use as a Hyperledger Fabric client to interact with the Hyperledger Fabric endpoints that Amazon Managed Blockchain exposes for your member and network resources. For more information, see Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) in the Amazon VPC User Guide. Applicable charges for interface VPC endpoints apply. For more information, see AWS PrivateLink Pricing.
The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) principal (user) identity that you use must have sufficient IAM permissions to create an interface VPC endpoint in your AWS account. For more information, see Controlling Access - Creating and Managing VPC Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
You can create the interface VPC endpoint using a shortcut in the Managed Blockchain console.
To create an interface VPC endpoint using the Managed Blockchain console


Open the Managed Blockchain console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/managedblockchain/.


Choose Networks, select your network from the list, and then choose View details.


Choose Create VPC endpoint.


Choose a VPC.


For Subnets, choose a subnet from the list, and then choose additional subnets as necessary.


For Security groups, choose an EC2 security group from the list, and then choose additional security groups as necessary. We recommend that you select the same security group that your framework client EC2 instance is associated with.


Choose Create.
