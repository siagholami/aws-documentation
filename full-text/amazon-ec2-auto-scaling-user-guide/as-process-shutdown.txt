Deleting your Auto Scaling infrastructure
To completely delete your scaling infrastructure, complete the following tasks.
Topics
 Delete your Auto Scaling group
 (Optional) Delete the launch configuration
 (Optional) Delete the launch template
 (Optional) Delete the load balancer and target groups
 (Optional) Delete CloudWatch alarms
Delete your Auto Scaling group
When you delete an Auto Scaling group, its desired, minimum, and maximum values are set to 0. As a result, the instances are terminated. Deleting an instance also deletes any associated logs or data, and any volumes on the instance. If do not want to terminate one or more instances, you can detach them before you delete the Auto Scaling group. If the group has scaling policies, deleting the group deletes the policies, the underlying alarm actions, and any alarm that no longer has an associated action.
To delete your Auto Scaling group (console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under AUTO SCALING, choose Auto Scaling Groups.


On the Auto Scaling Groups page, select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group and choose Delete (Old console: choose Actions, Delete). 


When prompted for confirmation, choose Delete.


A loading icon in the Name column indicates that the Auto Scaling group is being deleted. The Desired, Min, and Max columns show 0 instances for the Auto Scaling group. It takes a few minutes to terminate the instance and delete the group. Refresh the list to see the current state. 
To delete your Auto Scaling group (AWS CLI)
Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/delete-auto-scaling-group.html command to delete the Auto Scaling group. 
aws autoscaling delete-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg
If the group has instances or scaling activities in progress, use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/delete-auto-scaling-group.html command with the --force-delete option. This will also terminate the Amazon EC2 instances.
aws autoscaling delete-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --force-delete
(Optional) Delete the launch configuration
You can skip this step to keep the launch configuration for future use.
To delete the launch configuration (console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under AUTO SCALING, choose Launch Configurations.


On the Launch Configurations page, choose your launch configuration and choose Actions, Delete launch configuration.


When prompted for confirmation, choose Yes, Delete.


To delete the launch configuration (AWS CLI)
Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/delete-launch-configuration.html command.
aws autoscaling delete-launch-configuration --launch-configuration-name my-launch-config
(Optional) Delete the launch template
You can delete your launch template or just one version of your launch template. When you delete a launch template, all its versions are deleted.
You can skip this step to keep the launch template for future use. 
To delete your launch template (console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under INSTANCES, choose Launch Templates.


Select your launch template and then do one of the following: 
    Choose Actions, Delete template. When prompted for confirmation, choose Delete launch template.
    Choose Actions, Delete template version. Select the version to delete and choose Delete launch template version.


To delete the launch template (AWS CLI)
Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/delete-launch-template.html command to delete your template and all its versions.
aws ec2 delete-launch-template --launch-template-id lt-068f72b72934aff71
Alternatively, you can use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/delete-launch-template-versions.html command to delete a specific version of a launch template. 
aws ec2 delete-launch-template-versions --launch-template-id lt-068f72b72934aff71 --versions 1
(Optional) Delete the load balancer and target groups
Skip this step if your Auto Scaling group is not associated with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, or if you want to keep the load balancer for future use. 
To delete your load balancer (console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Choose the load balancer and choose Actions, Delete.


When prompted for confirmation, choose Yes, Delete.


To delete your target group (console)

To delete the load balancer associated with the Auto Scaling group (AWS CLI)
For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/delete-load-balancer.html and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/delete-target-group.html commands.
aws elbv2 delete-load-balancer --load-balancer-arn my-load-balancer-arn
aws elbv2 delete-target-group --target-group-arn my-target-group-arn
For Classic Load Balancers, use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elb/delete-load-balancer.html command.
aws elb delete-load-balancer --load-balancer-name my-load-balancer
(Optional) Delete CloudWatch alarms
To delete any CloudWatch alarms associated with your Auto Scaling group, complete the following steps. 
You can skip this step if your Auto Scaling group is not associated with any CloudWatch alarms, or if you want to keep the alarms for future use.
Note
Deleting an Auto Scaling group automatically deletes the CloudWatch alarms that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling manages for a target tracking scaling policy. 
To delete the CloudWatch alarms (console)


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


On the navigation pane, choose Alarms.


Choose the alarms and choose Action, Delete.


When prompted for confirmation, choose Delete.


To delete the CloudWatch alarms (AWS CLI)
Use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/delete-alarms.html command. You can delete one or more alarms at a time. For example, use the following command to delete the Step-Scaling-AlarmHigh-AddCapacity and Step-Scaling-AlarmLow-RemoveCapacity alarms.
aws cloudwatch delete-alarms --alarm-name Step-Scaling-AlarmHigh-AddCapacity Step-Scaling-AlarmLow-RemoveCapacity
