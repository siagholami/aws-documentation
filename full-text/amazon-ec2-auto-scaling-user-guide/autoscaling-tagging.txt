Tagging Auto Scaling groups and instances
Tags help you to categorize your Auto Scaling groups in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. 
You can add multiple tags to each Auto Scaling group. Additionally, you can propagate the tags from the Auto Scaling group to the Amazon EC2 instances it launches. Tagging your instances enables you to see instance cost allocation by tag in your AWS bill. For more information, see Using cost allocation tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
You can also control which IAM users and groups in your account have permission to create, edit, or delete tags. For more information, see Control which tag keys and tag values can be used. Keep in mind, however, that a policy that restricts your users from performing a tagging operation on an Auto Scaling group does not prevent them from manually changing the tags on the instances after they have launched. For information about IAM policies for tagging (or untagging) Amazon EC2 resources, see Example: Tagging resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Tags are not propagated to Amazon EBS volumes. To add tags to Amazon EBS volumes, specify the tags in a launch template but use caution when configuring instance tags in your launch template. If the launch template specifies an instance tag with a key that is also specified for the Auto Scaling group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling overrides the value of that instance tag with the value specified by the Auto Scaling group. For information about specifying tags in a launch template, see Creating a launch template for an Auto Scaling group.

Tag restrictions
The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
 The maximum number of tags per resource is 50.
 The maximum number of tags that you can add or remove using a single call is 25.
 The maximum key length is 128 Unicode characters.
 The maximum value length is 256 Unicode characters.
 Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
 Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values, because it is reserved for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix, and they do not count toward your limit of tags per Auto Scaling group.
Tagging lifecycle
If you have opted to propagate tags to your Amazon EC2 instances, the tags are managed as follows:
 When an Auto Scaling group launches instances, it adds tags to the instances during resource creation rather than after the resource is created. 
 The Auto Scaling group automatically adds a tag to the instances with a key of aws:autoscaling:groupName and a value of the name of the Auto Scaling group. 
 When you attach existing instances, the Auto Scaling group adds the tags to the instances, overwriting any existing tags with the same tag key. In addition, it adds a tag with a key of aws:autoscaling:groupName and a value of the name of the Auto Scaling group.
 When you detach an instance from an Auto Scaling group, it removes only the aws:autoscaling:groupName tag.
 When you scale in manually or the Auto Scaling group automatically scales in, it removes all tags from the instances that are terminating.
Add or modify tags for your Auto Scaling group
When you add a tag to your Auto Scaling group, you can specify whether it should be added to instances launched in the Auto Scaling group. If you modify a tag, the updated version of the tag is added to instances launched in the Auto Scaling group after the change. If you create or modify a tag for an Auto Scaling group, these changes are not made to instances that are already running in the Auto Scaling group.

Add or modify tags (console)
Use the Amazon EC2 console to:
 Add tags to new Auto Scaling groups when you create them
 Add, modify, or delete tags for existing Auto Scaling groups
To tag an Auto Scaling group on creation
When you use the Amazon EC2 console to create an Auto Scaling group, you can specify tag keys and values on the Configure Tags page of the Create Auto Scaling Group wizard. To propagate a tag to the instances launched in the Auto Scaling group, make sure that you keep the Tag New Instances option for that tag selected. Otherwise, you can deselect it. 
To add or modify tags for an existing Auto Scaling group


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under AUTO SCALING, choose Auto Scaling Groups.


Select the check box next to the Auto Scaling group.


A split pane opens up in the bottom part of the Auto Scaling groups page, showing information about the group that's selected. 


On the Details tab, choose Tags, Edit. (Old console: On the Tags tab, choose Add/Edit tags.)


To modify existing tags, edit Key and Value.


To add a new tag, choose Add tag and edit Key and Value. You can keep Tag new instances selected to add the tag to the instances launched in the Auto Scaling group automatically, and deselect it otherwise.


When you have finished adding tags, choose Update.


Add or modify tags (AWS CLI)
The following examples show how to use the AWS CLI to add tags when you create Auto Scaling groups, and to add or modify tags for existing Auto Scaling groups. 
To tag an Auto Scaling group on creation
 Use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-auto-scaling-group.html command to create a new Auto Scaling group and add a tag, for example, env=prod, to the Auto Scaling group. The tag is also added to any instances launched in the Auto Scaling group.
aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
    --launch-configuration-name my-launch-config --min-size 1 --max-size 3 \
    --vpc-zone-identifier "subnet-5ea0c127,subnet-6194ea3b,subnet-c934b782" \
    --tags Key=env,Value=prod,PropagateAtLaunch=true
To create or modify tags for an existing Auto Scaling group
 Use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-or-update-tags.html command to create or modify a tag. For example, the following command adds the Name=my-asg and cost-center=cc123 tags. The tags are also added to any instances launched in the Auto Scaling group after this change. If a tag with either key already exists, the existing tag is replaced. The Amazon EC2 console associates the display name for each instance with the name that is specified for the Name key (case-sensitive).
aws autoscaling create-or-update-tags \
    --tags ResourceId=my-asg,ResourceType=auto-scaling-group,Key=Name,Value=my-asg,PropagateAtLaunch=true \
    ResourceId=my-asg,ResourceType=auto-scaling-group,Key=cost-center,Value=cc123,PropagateAtLaunch=true
To list all tags for an Auto Scaling group
 Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-tags.html command to list the tags for the specified Auto Scaling group.
aws autoscaling describe-tags --filters Name=auto-scaling-group,Values=my-asg
The following is an example response.
{
      "Tags": [
          {
              "ResourceType": "auto-scaling-group",
              "ResourceId": "my-asg",
              "PropagateAtLaunch": true,
              "Value": "prod",
              "Key": "env"
          }
      ]
  }
 Alternatively, use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-auto-scaling-groups.html command to verify that the tag is added to the Auto Scaling group.
aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg
The following is an example response.
{
      "AutoScalingGroups": [
          {
              "AutoScalingGroupARN": "arn",
              "HealthCheckGracePeriod": 0,
              "SuspendedProcesses": [],
              "DesiredCapacity": 1,
              "Tags": [
                  {
                      "ResourceType": "auto-scaling-group",
                      "ResourceId": "my-asg",
                      "PropagateAtLaunch": true,
                      "Value": "prod",
                      "Key": "env"
                  }
              ],
              "EnabledMetrics": [],
              "LoadBalancerNames": [],
              "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
              ...
          }
      ]
  }

You can delete a tag associated with your Auto Scaling group at any time.

Choose an existing group from the list.


On the Tags tab, choose Add/Edit tags. The Add/Edit Auto Scaling Group Tags page lists any existing tags for the Auto Scaling group.

Delete tags (AWS CLI)
Use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/delete-tags.html command to delete a tag. For example, the following command deletes a tag with a key of env.
aws autoscaling delete-tags --tags "ResourceId=my-asg,ResourceType=auto-scaling-group,Key=env"
You must specify the tag key, but you don't have to specify the value. If you specify a value and the value is incorrect, the tag is not deleted.
