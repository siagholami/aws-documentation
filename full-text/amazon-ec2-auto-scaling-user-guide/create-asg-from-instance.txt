Creating an Auto Scaling group using an EC2 instance
When you create an Auto Scaling group, you must specify the necessary information to configure the Amazon EC2 instances, the subnets for the instances, and the initial number of instances.
To configure Amazon EC2 instances, you can specify a launch configuration, a launch template, or an EC2 instance. The following procedure demonstrates how to create an Auto Scaling group using an EC2 instance. To use a launch configuration or a launch template, see Creating an Auto Scaling group using a launch configuration or Creating an Auto Scaling group using a launch template.
When you create an Auto Scaling group using an EC2 instance, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling creates a launch configuration for you and associates it with the Auto Scaling group. This launch configuration has the same name as the Auto Scaling group, and it derives its attributes from the specified instance, such as AMI ID, instance type, and Availability Zone.
Limitations
The following are limitations when creating an Auto Scaling group from an EC2 instance:
 If the identified instance has tags, the tags are not copied to the Tags attribute of the new Auto Scaling group.
 The Auto Scaling group includes the block device mapping from the AMI used to launch the instance. It does not include any block devices attached after instance launch.
 If the identified instance is registered with one or more load balancers, the information about the load balancer is not copied to the load balancer or target group attribute of the new Auto Scaling group.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, find the ID of the EC2 instance using the Amazon EC2 console or the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html command (AWS CLI). The EC2 instance must meet the following criteria:
 The instance is in the Availability Zone in which to create the Auto Scaling group.
 The instance is not a member of another Auto Scaling group.
 The instance is in the running state.
 The AMI used to launch the instance must still exist.

You can use the console to create an Auto Scaling group from a running EC2 instance and add the instance to the new Auto Scaling group. For more information, see Attach EC2 instances to your Auto Scaling group.
Create an Auto Scaling group from an EC2 instance (AWS CLI)
Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-auto-scaling-group.html command to create an Auto Scaling group, my-asg-from-instance, from the EC2 instance i-7f12e649.
aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg-from-instance \
  --instance-id i-7f12e649 --min-size 1 --max-size 2 --desired-capacity 2
Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-auto-scaling-groups.html command to describe the Auto Scaling group.
aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg-from-instance
The following example response shows that the desired capacity of the group is 2, the group has 2 running instances, and the launch configuration is named my-asg-from-instance.
