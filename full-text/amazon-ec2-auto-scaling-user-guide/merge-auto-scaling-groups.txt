Merging your Auto Scaling groups into a single multi-zone group
To merge separate single-zone Auto Scaling groups into a single group spanning multiple Availability Zones, rezone one of the single-zone groups into a multi-zone group. Then, delete the other groups. This works for groups with or without a load balancer, as long as the new multi-zone group is in one of the same Availability Zones as the original single-zone groups.
The following examples assume that you have two identical groups in two different Availability Zones, us-west-2a and us-west-2c. These two groups share the following specifications: 
 Minimum size = 2
 Maximum size = 5
 Desired capacity = 3
Merge zones (AWS CLI)
Use the following procedure to merge my-group-a and my-group-c into a single group that covers both us-west-2a and us-west-2c.
To merge separate single-zone groups into a single multi-zone group

Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html command to add the us-west-2c Availability Zone to the supported Availability Zones for my-group-a. Increase the maximum size of this group to allow for the instances from both single-zone groups.

aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-group-a \
     --availability-zones "us-west-2a" "us-west-2c" \
     –-max-size 10 –-min-size 4

Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/set-desired-capacity.html command to increase the size of my-group-a.

aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity --auto-scaling-group-name my-group-a \
     --desired-capacity 6

(Optional) Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-auto-scaling-groups.html command to verify that my-group-a is at its new size.

aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --auto-scaling-group-name my-group-a

Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html command to remove the instances from my-group-c.

aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-group-c \
     --min-size 0 --max-size 0

(Optional) Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-auto-scaling-groups.html command to verify that no instances remain in my-group-c.

aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --auto-scaling-group-name my-group-c
The following is example output.

Use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/delete-auto-scaling-group.html command to delete my-group-c.

aws autoscaling delete-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-group-c
