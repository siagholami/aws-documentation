Replacing a launch configuration with a launch template
When you edit an Auto Scaling group that has an existing launch configuration, you have the option of replacing the launch configuration with a launch template. This lets you use launch templates with any Auto Scaling groups that you currently use. In doing so, you can take advantage of the versioning and other features of launch templates. 
After you replace the launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group, any new instances are launched using the new launch template, but existing instances are not affected. To update the existing instances, terminate them so that they are replaced by your Auto Scaling group, or allow automatic scaling to gradually replace older instances with newer instances based on your termination policies. 
Note
With the maximum instance lifetime and instance refresh features, you can also replace all instances in the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances that use the launch template. For more information, see Replacing Auto Scaling instances based on maximum instance lifetime and Replacing Auto Scaling instances based on an instance refresh.
Prerequisites
Before you can replace a launch configuration in an Auto Scaling group, you must first create your launch template. The easiest way to create a launch template is to copy it from the launch configuration. For more information, see Copying a launch configuration to a launch template.
When you replace a launch configuration with a launch template, your ec2:RunInstances permissions are checked. If you are attempting to use a launch template and you do not have sufficient permissions, you receive an error that you're not authorized to use the launch template. For information about the required IAM permissions, see Launch template support.
