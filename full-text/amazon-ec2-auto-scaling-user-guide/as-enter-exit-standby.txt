Temporarily removing instances from your Auto Scaling group
You can put an instance that is in the InService state into the Standby state, update or troubleshoot the instance, and then return the instance to service. Instances that are on standby are still part of the Auto Scaling group, but they do not actively handle application traffic.
Important
You are billed for instances that are in a standby state.
For example, you can change the launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group at any time, and any subsequent instances that the Auto Scaling group launches use this configuration. However, the Auto Scaling group does not update the instances that are currently in service. You can terminate these instances and let the Auto Scaling group replace them. Or, you can put the instances on standby, update the software, and then put the instances back in service.

How the standby state works
The standby state works as follows to help you temporarily remove an instance from your Auto Scaling group:


You put the instance into the standby state. The instance remains in this state until you exit the standby state.


If there is a load balancer or target group attached to your Auto Scaling group, the instance is deregistered from the load balancer or target group.


By default, the value that you specified as your desired capacity is decremented when you put an instance on standby. This prevents the launch of an additional instance while you have this instance on standby. Alternatively, you can specify that your desired capacity is not decremented. If you specify this option, the Auto Scaling group launches an instance to replace the one on standby. The intention is to help you maintain capacity for your application while one or more instances are on standby. 


You can update or troubleshoot the instance.


You return the instance to service by exiting the standby state.


After you put an instance that was on standby back in service, the desired capacity is incremented. If you did not decrement the capacity when you put the instance on standby, the Auto Scaling group detects that you have more instances than you need. It applies the termination policy in effect to reduce the size of the group. For more information, see Controlling which Auto Scaling instances terminate during scale in.


If there is a load balancer or target group attached to your Auto Scaling group, the instance is registered with the load balancer or target group.


The following illustration shows the transitions between instance states in this process:

Health status of an instance in a standby state
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not perform health checks on instances that are in a standby state. While the instance is in a standby state, its health status reflects the status that it had before you put it on standby. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not perform a health check on the instance until you put it back in service.
For example, if you put a healthy instance on standby and then terminate it, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling continues to report the instance as healthy. If you attempt to put a terminated instance that was on standby back in service, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling performs a health check on the instance, determines that it is terminating and unhealthy, and launches a replacement instance.
Temporarily remove an instance (console)
The following procedure demonstrates the general process for updating an instance that is currently in service.
To temporarily remove an instance


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under AUTO SCALING, choose Auto Scaling Groups.


Select the check box next to the Auto Scaling group.


A split pane opens up in the bottom part of the Auto Scaling groups page, showing information about the group that's selected. 


On the Instance management tab, in Instances, select an instance. (Old console: The Instances tab is where you can select the instance.) 


Choose Actions, Set to Standby.


In the Set to Standby dialog box, select the check box to launch a replacement instance. Leave it unchecked to decrement the desired capacity. Choose Set to Standby.


You can update or troubleshoot your instance as needed. When you have finished, continue with the next step to return the instance to service.


Select the instance, choose Actions, Set to InService. In the Set to InService dialog box, choose Set to InService.


Temporarily remove an instance (AWS CLI)
The following procedure demonstrates the general process for updating an instance that is currently in service.
To temporarily remove an instance

Use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-auto-scaling-instances.html command to identify the instance to update.

aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-instances
The following is an example response.
{
       "AutoScalingInstances": [
           {
               "ProtectedFromScaleIn": false,
               "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2a",
               "LaunchTemplate": {
                   "LaunchTemplateName": "my-launch-template",
                   "Version": "1",
                   "LaunchTemplateId": "lt-050555ad16a3f9c7f"
               },
               "InstanceId": "i-05b4f7d5be44822a6",
               "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
               "HealthStatus": "HEALTHY",
               "LifecycleState": "InService"
           },
          ...
       ]
   }

Move the instance into a Standby state using the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/enter-standby.html command. The --should-decrement-desired-capacity option decreases the desired capacity so that the Auto Scaling group does not launch a replacement instance.

aws autoscaling enter-standby --instance-ids i-05b4f7d5be44822a6 \
     --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --should-decrement-desired-capacity
The following is an example response.

               "StatusCode": "InProgress"
           }
       ]
   }

(Optional) Verify that the instance is in Standby using the following describe-auto-scaling-instances command.

aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-instances --instance-ids i-05b4f7d5be44822a6
The following is an example response. Notice that the status of the instance is now Standby.

               "LifecycleState": "Standby"
           },
          ...
       ]
   }


You can update or troubleshoot your instance as needed. When you have finished, continue with the next step to return the instance to service.


Put the instance back in service using the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/exit-standby.html command.

               "StatusCode": "PreInService"
