Delete an Application Load Balancer
As soon as your load balancer becomes available, you are billed for each hour or partial hour that you keep it running. When you no longer need the load balancer, you can delete it. As soon as the load balancer is deleted, you stop incurring charges for it.
You can't delete a load balancer if deletion protection is enabled. For more information, see Deletion protection.
Note that deleting a load balancer does not affect its registered targets. For example, your EC2 instances continue to run and are still registered to their target groups. To delete your target groups, see Delete a target group.
To delete a load balancer using the console


If you have a CNAME record for your domain that points to your load balancer, point it to a new location and wait for the DNS change to take effect before deleting your load balancer.


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer, and then choose Actions, Delete.


When prompted for confirmation, choose Yes, Delete.
