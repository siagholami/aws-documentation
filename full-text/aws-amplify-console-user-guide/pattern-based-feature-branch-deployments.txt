Pattern-based feature branch deployments
Pattern-based branch deployments allow you to automatically deploy branches that match a specific pattern to the Amplify Console. Product teams using feature branch or GitFlow workflows for their releases, can now define patterns such as ‘release**’ to automatically deploy Git branches that begin with ‘release’ to a shareable URL. This blog post describes using this feature with different team workflows.


Choose App settings > General > Edit.


Flip the branch autodetection switch to Enabled.





Define patterns for automatically deploying branches.
    * – Deploys all branches in your repository.
    release*’ – Deploys all branches that being with the word ‘release.
    release*/ – Deploys all branches that match a ‘release /’ pattern.
    Specify multiple patterns in a comma-separated list. For example, release*, feature*.


Set up automatic password protection for all branches that are automatically created by setting Branch autodetection - access control to Enabled.


For applications built with an Amplify backend, you can choose to create a new environment or point all branches to an existing backend.
