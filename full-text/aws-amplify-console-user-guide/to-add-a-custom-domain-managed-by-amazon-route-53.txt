Add a custom domain managed by Amazon Route 53
To add a custom domain managed by Amazon Route 53


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amplify Console.


Choose your app that you want to connect to a custom domain.


In the navigation pane, choose App Settings, Domain management.


On the Domain management page, choose Add domain.



For Domain, enter your root domain, choose the domain you want to use when it appears in the list, and then choose Configure Domain.


As you start typing, any root domains that you already manage in RouteÂ 53 appear in the list. For example, if the name of your domain is https://example.com, enter example.com for Domain.


By default, the Amplify console automatically creates two subdomain entries for your domain. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you will see the subdomains https://www.example.com and https://example.com with a redirect set up from the root domain to the www subdomain.

(Optional) You can modify the default configuration if you want to add subdomains only. To change the default configuration, choose Rewrites and redirects from the navigation pane, configure your domain, and then choose Save. 

Note
 It can take up to 24 hours for the DNS to propagate and to issue the SSL certificate. For help with resolving errors that occur, see Troubleshooting custom domains.
