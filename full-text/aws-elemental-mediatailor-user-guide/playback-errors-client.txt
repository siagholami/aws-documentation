400
BadRequestException
MediaTailor is unable to service the request due to one or more errors in formatting or content. A parameter might be improperly formatted, or the request might contain an invalid playback configuration or session ID.
Check that your request is properly formatted and contains accurate information. Make sure that the playback endpoint setting on the player matches the ManifestEndpointPrefix setting returned by GetPlaybackConfiguration. Retry your request.


403
AccessDeniedException
The host header provided in the request doesn't match the manifest endpoint prefix that is configured in the MediaTailor playback URL. Your CDN might be misconfigured.
Check your CDN settings and make sure that you are using the correct manifest endpoint prefix for MediaTailor. Retry your request.


404
NotFoundException
MediaTailor is unable to find the information specified. Possible reasons include a URL that doesn't map to anything in the service, a configuration that isn't defined, or a session that is unavailable.
Check your configuration and the validity of your request, and then reinitialize the session.


409
ConflictException
A player tried to load multiple playlists simultaneously for a single session. As a result, MediaTailor detected a session consistency conflict. This problem occurs for HLS players.
Make sure that your player requests playlists one at a time. This is in accordance with the HLS specification.


410
Gone
An AWS Support operator has blocked a player session or customer configuration. AWS Support does this in rare circumstances when we detect a very high volume of 4xx requests coming from errant traffic for a single session or configuration.
If you think that the request shouldn't be blocked, contact AWS Support. They can look into it and remove the blocking filter, if appropriate.



If you need further assistance, contact AWS Support.
