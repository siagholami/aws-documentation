Resilience in AWS Elemental MediaTailor
The AWS global infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures.
