HLS Manifest Tag Handling
This section describes how AWS Elemental MediaTailor manages tags in the personalized output manifest.
EXT-X-CUE Tags
MediaTailor replaces EXT-X-CUE-OUT, EXT-X-CUE-OUT-CONT, and EXT-X-CUE-IN tags in the input manifest with EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY tags in the output manifest. The DISCONTINUITY tags mark the following boundaries:
 Where the main content transitions to an ad
 Where one ad transitions to another ad
 Where an ad transitions back to the main content
EXT-X-DATERANGE Tags
MediaTailor passes through EXT-X-DATERANGE tags from the input manifest to the output manifest. MediaTailor also inserts EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY tags that correspond to the DATERANGE tags. The DISCONTINUITY tags mark the following boundaries:
 Where the main content transitions to an ad
 Where one ad transitions to another ad
 Where an ad transitions back to the main content
EXT-X-KEY Tags
MediaTailor passes through EXT-X-KEY tags from the input manifest. These tags indicate that the main content is encrypted. Since ads aren't encrypted, MediaTailor inserts EXT-X-KEY:METHOD=NONE at the start of an ad avail. When playback returns to the main content, MediaTailor re-enables encryption by inserting the EXT-X-KEY tag with the METHOD value defined as the encryption type.
Unrecognized Tags
MediaTailor passes through all unknown and custom tags from the input manifest to the output manifest.
