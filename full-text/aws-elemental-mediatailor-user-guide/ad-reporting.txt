Ad Tracking Reporting in AWS Elemental MediaTailor
Beacons are sent to the ad server to track and report on how much of an ad that a viewer has watched. AWS Elemental MediaTailor provides server-side ad reporting (MediaTailor tracks the ad and sends beacons) or client-side tracking (the client player tracks the ad and sends beacons). The type of reporting that is used in a playback session depends on the request that the player uses to initiate the session in MediaTailor.
