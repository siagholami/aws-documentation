How AWS Elemental MediaTailor Handles BaseURLs for DASH
With server-side ad insertion, the content segments and ad segments come from different locations. In your DASH manifests, AWS Elemental MediaTailor manages URL settings based on your content distribution network (CDN) configuration and the URLs specified in the manifest. MediaTailor uses the rules in the following list to manage the BaseURL settings in your DASH manifests for your content segments and ad segments. 
AWS Elemental MediaTailor behavior for content segments:
 If you specify a CDN content segment prefix in your configuration, then MediaTailor makes sure that there is exactly one BaseURL, with your specified prefix, defined at the MPD level.
 If you do not specify a CDN content segment prefix, then MediaTailor uses the origin template manifest as follows: 
   If the origin template manifest contains one or more BaseURL settings at the MPD level, MediaTailor leaves them unmodified.
   If the origin template manifest does not contain any BaseURL settings at the MPD level, MediaTailor adds one that is based on the origin MPD URL. 
For ad segments, AWS Elemental MediaTailor does the following:
 If you specify a CDN ad segment prefix in your configuration, then MediaTailor ensures that each ad period has exactly one BaseURL setting, populated with the configured prefix. 
 If you do not specify a CDN ad segment prefix, then MediaTailor adds exactly one BaseURL setting to each ad period that points to the ad content server that is set up by MediaTailor for serving ad segments.
