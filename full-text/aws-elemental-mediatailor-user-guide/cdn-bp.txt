CDN Best Practices with AWS Elemental MediaTailor
We highly recommend that you use a content distribution network (CDN) to cache content and ad segments, but personalized manifest responses must not be cached or shared between viewers. Use the following settings for manifest traffic in your CDN to make the most of the service:
 Set all time to live (TTL) settings to 0. This includes the maximum, minimum, and default TTL.
 Forward all query strings to MediaTailor. This way, all ad variables can be passed to the ad decision server (ADS) to determine the ads to be used in this playback session.
 Forward the User-Agent header to MediaTailor. The ADS often needs to know what user agent is requesting the content. If you don't forward the User-Agent header, the value that MediaTailor receives is the user agent of your CDN.
