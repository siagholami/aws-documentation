HLS .m3u8 Manifests
AWS Elemental MediaTailor supports .m3u8 HLS manifests with an EXT-X-VERSION of 3 or higher for live streaming and video on demand (VOD). When MediaTailor encounters an ad avail, it attempts ad insertion or replacement, based on the type of content. If there aren't enough ads to fill the duration, for the remainder of the ad avail, MediaTailor displays the underlying content stream or the configured slate. For more information about HLS ad behavior based on content type (live or VOD), see Ad Behavior in AWS Elemental MediaTailor.
