Upload Large Amounts of Data with AWS Import/Export
AWS Import/Export is a service you can use to transfer large amounts of data from physical storage devices into AWS. You mail your portable storage devices to AWS and AWS Import/Export transfers data directly off of your storage devices using Amazon's high-speed internal network. Your data load typically begins the next business day after your storage device arrives at AWS. After the data export or import completes, we return your storage device. For large data sets, AWS data transfer can be significantly faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective than upgrading your connectivity. For more information, see the AWS Import/Export Developer Guide.
