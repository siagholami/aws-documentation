CloudWatch Events and Metrics
You can use events and metrics to track the activity and health of an Amazon EMR cluster, viewing events and metrics quickly in the Amazon EMR console for a single cluster, and viewing events for all clusters in a region. You can use CloudWatch Events to define an action to take when Amazon EMR generates an event that matches a pattern that you specify, and you can also use CloudWatch to monitor metrics.
Events are useful for monitoring a specific occurrence within a cluster—for example, when a cluster changes state from starting to running. Metrics are useful for monitoring a specific value—for example, the percentage of available disk space that HDFS is using within a cluster.
