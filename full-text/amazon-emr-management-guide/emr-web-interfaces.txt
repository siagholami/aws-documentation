View Web Interfaces Hosted on Amazon EMR Clusters
Hadoop and other applications you install on your Amazon EMR cluster, publish user interfaces as web sites hosted on the master node. For security reasons, when using EMR-Managed Security Groups, these web sites are only available on the master node's local web server, so you need to connect to the master node to view them. For more information, see Connect to the Master Node Using SSH. Hadoop also publishes user interfaces as web sites hosted on the core and task nodes. These web sites are also only available on local web servers on the nodes. 
Warning
It is possible to configure a custom security group to allow inbound access to these web interfaces. Keep in mind that any port on which you allow inbound traffic represents a potential security vulnerability. Carefully review custom security groups to ensure that you minimize vulnerabilities. For more information, see Control Network Traffic with Security Groups.
The following table lists web interfaces that you can view on cluster instances. These Hadoop interfaces are available on all clusters. For the master instance interfaces, replace master-public-dns-name with the Master public DNS listed on the cluster Summary tab in the EMR console. For core and task instance interfaces, replace coretask-public-dns-name with the Public DNS name listed for the instance. To find an instance's Public DNS name, in the EMR console, choose your cluster from the list, choose the Hardware tab, choose the ID of the instance group that contains the instance you want to connect to, and then note the Public DNS name listed for the instance.
Important
To access web interfaces, you must edit the security groups associated with master and core instances so that they have an inbound rule that allows SSH traffic (port 22) from trusted clients, such as your computer's IP address. For more information about modifying security group rules, see Adding Rules to a Security Group in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

Because there are several application-specific interfaces available on the master node that are not available on the core and task nodes, the instructions in this document are specific to the Amazon EMR master node. Accessing the web interfaces on the core and task nodes can be done in the same manner as you would access the web interfaces on the master node. 
There are several ways you can access the web interfaces on the master node. The easiest and quickest method is to use SSH to connect to the master node and use the text-based browser, Lynx, to view the web sites in your SSH client. However, Lynx is a text-based browser with a limited user interface that cannot display graphics. The following example shows how to open the Hadoop ResourceManager interface using Lynx (Lynx URLs are also provided when you log into the master node using SSH). 
lynx http://ip-###-##-##-###.us-west-2.compute.internal:8088/
There are two remaining options for accessing web interfaces on the master node that provide full browser functionality. Choose one of the following: 
 Option 1 (recommended for more technical users): Use an SSH client to connect to the master node, configure SSH tunneling with local port forwarding, and use an Internet browser to open web interfaces hosted on the master node. This method allows you to configure web interface access without using a SOCKS proxy.
 Option 2 (recommended for new users): Use an SSH client to connect to the master node, configure SSH tunneling with dynamic port forwarding, and configure your Internet browser to use an add-on such as FoxyProxy or SwitchySharp to manage your SOCKS proxy settings. This method allows you to automatically filter URLs based on text patterns and to limit the proxy settings to domains that match the form of the master node's DNS name. The browser add-on automatically handles turning the proxy on and off when you switch between viewing websites hosted on the master node, and those on the Internet. For more information about how to configure FoxyProxy for Firefox and Google Chrome, see Option 2, Part 2: Configure Proxy Settings to View Websites Hosted on the Master Node.
With Amazon EMR version 5.25.0 or later, you can access Spark history server UI from the console without setting up a web proxy through an SSH connection. For more information, see One-click Access to Persistent Spark History Server.
