View and Monitor a Cluster
Amazon EMR provides several tools you can use to gather information about your cluster. You can access information about the cluster from the console, the CLI or programmatically. The standard Hadoop web interfaces and log files are available on the master node. You can also use monitoring services such as CloudWatch and Ganglia to track the performance of your cluster.
