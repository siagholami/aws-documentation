Add a Git Repository to Amazon EMR
To add a Git repository as a resource in your Amazon EMR account


Open the Amazon EMR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/.


Choose Git repositories, then choose Add repository.


For Repository name, enter a name to use for the repository in Amazon EMR. 


Names may only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), or underscores (_).


For Git repository URL, enter the URL for the repository.


For Branch, enter a branch name. 


For Git credentials, choose the credentials to use to authenticate to the repository.
    Choose Use an existing AWS secret and select a secret from the list.
The existing secret must be in the following format: {"gitUsername": UserName, "gitPassword": Password}.
    Choose Create a new secret. 
  If you use Username and password, enter a name for the secret, and then enter the username and password.
  If you have two-factor authentication enabled for your Git repository, choose Personal access token (PAT). We recommend using a personal access token generated by your Git service provider instead of your account password. For more information, see Creating a personal access token for the command line for GitHub and Personal access tokens for Bitbucket.
    Choose Use a public repository without credentials if the Git repository is public.


Choose Add repository.
