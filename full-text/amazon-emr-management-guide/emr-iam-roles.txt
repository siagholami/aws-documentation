Configure IAM Service Roles for Amazon EMR Permissions to AWS Services and Resources
Amazon EMR and applications such as Hadoop and Spark need permissions to access other AWS resources and perform actions when they run. Each cluster in Amazon EMR must have a service role and a role for the Amazon EC2 instance profile. The IAM policies attached to these roles provide permissions for the cluster to interoperate with other AWS services on behalf of a user.
An additional role, the Auto Scaling role, is required if your cluster uses automatic scaling in Amazon EMR. The AWS service role for EMR Notebooks is required if you use EMR Notebooks. For more information, see IAM Roles and Using Instance Profiles in the IAM User Guide.
Amazon EMR provides default roles and default managed policies for each role that determine permissions. Managed policies are created and maintained by AWS, so they are updated automatically if service requirements change. 
If you are creating a cluster or notebook for the first time in an account, roles for Amazon EMR do not yet exist. After you create them, you can view the roles, the policies attached to them, and the permissions allowed or denied by the policies in the IAM console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/). You can specify default roles for Amazon EMR to create and use, you can create your own roles and specify them individually when you create a cluster to customize permissions, and you can specify default roles to be used when you create a cluster using the AWS CLI. For more information, see Customize IAM Roles.
Modifying Identity-Based Policies for Permissions to Pass Service Roles for Amazon EMR
Cluster users require permissions for applications to pass the service roles for Amazon EMR on their behalf. The AmazonElasticMapReduceFullAccess permissions policy, which is the default managed policy for users to have full permissions for Amazon EMR, includes a statement that allows the iam:PassRole permissions for all resources. This statement allows the user to pass any role to other AWS services so that Amazon EMR can interact with those services on behalf of the user.
To implement a more restrictive policy, attach an inline policy to appropriate users or groups that allows iam:PassRole only for roles specific to Amazon EMR. The following example demonstrates a statement that allows iam:PassRole permissions only for the default Amazon EMR roles: EMR_DefaultRole, EMR_EC2_DefaultRole, and EMR_AutoScalingDefaultRole. If you use custom roles, replace the default role names with your custom role names.
{
    "Action": "iam:PassRole",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/EMR_DefaultRole",
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/EMR_EC2_DefaultRole",
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole",
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/EMR_Notebooks_DefaultRole"
    ]
}
Service Role Summary
The following table lists the IAM service roles associated with Amazon EMR for quick reference.



Function
Default Role
Description
Default Managed Policy




Service Role for Amazon EMR (EMR Role)
EMR_DefaultRole
Allows Amazon EMR to call other AWS services on your behalf when provisioning resources and performing service-level actions. This role is required for all clusters.
AmazonElasticMapReduceRole Requesting Spot Instances requires a service-linked role. If this role doesn't exist, the EMR role must have permissions to create it or a permission error occurs. The managed policy includes a statement to allow this action. If you customize this role or policy, be sure to include a statement that allows the creation of this service-linked role. For more information, see Service Role for Amazon EMR (EMR Role) and Service-Linked Role for Spot Instance Requests in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.


Service Role for Cluster EC2 Instances (EC2 Instance Profile)
EMR_EC2_DefaultRole
Application processes that run on top of the Hadoop ecosystem on cluster instances use this role when they call other AWS services. For accessing data in Amazon S3 using EMRFS, you can specify different roles to be assumed based on the user or group making the request, or on the location of data in Amazon S3. For more information, see Configure IAM Roles for EMRFS Requests to Amazon S3. This role is required for all clusters.
AmazonElasticMapReduceforEC2Role. For more information, see Service Role for Cluster EC2 Instances (EC2 Instance Profile).


Service Role for Automatic Scaling in EMR (Auto Scaling Role)
EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole
Allows additional actions for dynamically scaling environments. Required only for clusters that use automatic scaling in Amazon EMR. For more information, see Using Automatic Scaling in Amazon EMR.
AmazonElasticMapReduceforAutoScalingRole. For more information, see Service Role for Automatic Scaling in EMR (Auto Scaling Role).


Service Role for EMR Notebooks
EMR_Notebooks_DefaultRole
Provides permissions that an EMR notebook needs to access other AWS resources and perform actions. Required only if EMR Notebooks is used.
AmazonElasticMapReduceEditorsRole. For more information, see Service Role for EMR Notebooks. S3FullAccessPolicy is also attached by default. The contents of this policy are shown below. {    "Version": "2012-10-17",    "Statement": [        {            "Effect": "Allow",            "Action": "s3:",            "Resource": ""        }    ]}


Service-Linked Role
AWSServiceRoleForEMRCleanup
Amazon EMR automatically creates a service-linked role. If the service for Amazon EMR has lost the ability to clean up Amazon EC2 resources, Amazon EMR can use this role to clean up. If a cluster uses Spot Instances, the permissions policy attached to the Service Role for Amazon EMR (EMR Role) must allow the creation of a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-Linked Role Permissions for Amazon EMR.
