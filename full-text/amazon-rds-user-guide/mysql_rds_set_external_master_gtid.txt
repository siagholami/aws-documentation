mysql.rds_set_external_master_gtid
Configures GTID-based replication from a MariaDB instance running external to Amazon RDS to an Amazon RDS MariaDB DB instance. This stored procedure is supported only where the external MariaDB instance is version 10.0.24 or greater. When setting up replication where one or both instances do not support MariaDB global transaction identifiers (GTIDs), use mysql.rds_set_external_master.
Using GTIDs for replication provides crash-safety features not offered by binary log replication, so we recommend it in cases where the replicating instances support it. 
Syntax
CALL mysql.rds_set_external_master_gtid(
  host_name
  , host_port
  , replication_user_name
  , replication_user_password
  , gtid
  , ssl_encryption
);
Parameters
host_name 
String. The host name or IP address of the MariaDB instance running external to Amazon RDS that will become the source instance.
host_port 
Integer. The port used by the MariaDB instance running external to Amazon RDS to be configured as the source instance. If your network configuration includes SSH port replication that converts the port number, specify the port number that is exposed by SSH.
replication_user_name 
String. The ID of a user with REPLICATION SLAVE permissions in the MariaDB DB instance to be configured as the read replica.
replication_user_password 
String. The password of the user ID specified in replication_user_name.
gtid 
String. The global transaction ID on the source instance that replication should start from.
You can use @@gtid_current_pos to get the current GTID if the source instance has been locked while you are configuring replication, so the binary log doesn't change between the points when you get the GTID and when replication starts.
Otherwise, if you are using mysqldump version 10.0.13 or greater to populate the replica instance prior to starting replication, you can get the GTID position in the output by using the --master-data or --dump-slave options. If you are not using mysqldump version 10.0.13 or greater, you can run the SHOW MASTER STATUS or use those same mysqldump options to get the binary log file name and position, then convert them to a GTID by running BINLOG_GTID_POS on the external MariaDB instance:  
SELECT BINLOG_GTID_POS('<binary log file name>', <binary log file position>);
For more information about the MariaDB implementation of GTIDs, go to Global Transaction ID in the MariaDB documentation.
ssl_encryption 
A value that specifies whether Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption is used on the replication connection. 1 specifies to use SSL encryption, 0 specifies to not use encryption. The default is 0.
The MASTER_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT option isn't supported. This option is set to 0, which means that the connection is encrypted, but the certificates aren't verified.
Usage Notes
The mysql.rds_set_external_master_gtid procedure must be run by the master user. It must be run on the MariaDB DB instance that you are configuring as the replica of a MariaDB instance running external to Amazon RDS. Before running mysql.rds_set_external_master_gtid, you must have configured the instance of MariaDB running external to Amazon RDS as a source instance. For more information, see Importing Data into a MariaDB DB Instance.
Warning
Do not use mysql.rds_set_external_master_gtid to manage replication between two Amazon RDS DB instances. Use it only when replicating with a MariaDB instance running external to RDS. For information about managing replication between Amazon RDS DB instances, see Working with Read Replicas.
After calling mysql.rds_set_external_master_gtid to configure an Amazon RDS DB instance as a read replica, you can call mysql.rds_start_replication on the replica to start the replication process. You can call mysql.rds_reset_external_master to remove the read replica configuration.
When mysql.rds_set_external_master_gtid is called, Amazon RDS records the time, user, and an action of "set master" in the mysql.rds_history and mysql.rds_replication_status tables.
Examples
When run on a MariaDB DB instance, the following example configures it as the replica of an instance of MariaDB running external to Amazon RDS.
call mysql.rds_set_external_master_gtid ('Sourcedb.some.com',3306,'ReplicationUser','SomePassW0rd','0-123-456',0);
