Working with MySQL Replication in Amazon RDS
You usually use read replicas to configure replication between Amazon RDS DB instances. For general information about read replicas, see Working with Read Replicas. For specific information about working with read replicas on Amazon RDS MySQL, see Working with MySQL Read Replicas. 
You can use global transaction identifiers (GTIDs) for replication with Amazon RDS MySQL. For more information, see Using GTID-Based Replication for Amazon RDS MySQL.
You can also set up replication between an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance and a MySQL or MariaDB instance that is external to Amazon RDS. For information about configuring replication with an external source, see Replication with a MySQL or MariaDB Instance Running External to Amazon RDS.
For any of these replication options, you can use either row-based replication, statement-based, or mixed replication. Row-based replication only replicates the changed rows that result from a SQL statement. Statement-based replication replicates the entire SQL statement. Mixed replication uses statement-based replication when possible, but switches to row-based replication when SQL statements that are unsafe for statement-based replication are run. In most cases, mixed replication is recommended. The binary log format of the DB instance determines whether replication is row-based, statement-based, or mixed. For information about setting the binary log format, see Binary Logging Format.
Note
You can configure replication to import databases from a MySQL or MariaDB instance that is external to Amazon RDS, or to export databases to such instances. For more information, see Importing Data to an Amazon RDS MySQL or MariaDB DB Instance with Reduced Downtime and Exporting Data from a MySQL DB Instance by Using Replication.
