Amazon RDS uses the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to provide notification when an Amazon RDS event occurs. These notifications can be in any notification form supported by Amazon SNS for an AWS Region, such as an email, a text message, or a call to an HTTP endpoint. 
Amazon RDS groups these events into categories that you can subscribe to so that you can be notified when an event in that category occurs. You can subscribe to an event category for a DB instance, DB snapshot,  DB parameter group, or DB security group. For example, if you subscribe to the Backup category for a given DB instance, you are notified whenever a backup-related event occurs that affects the DB instance. If you subscribe to a configuration change category for a DB security group, you are notified when the DB security group is changed. You also receive notification when an event notification subscription changes.
Event notifications are sent to the addresses that you provide when you create the subscription. You might want to create several different subscriptions, such as one subscription receiving all event notifications and another subscription that includes only critical events for your production DB instances. You can easily turn off notification without deleting a subscription by choosing No for Enabled in the Amazon RDS console or by setting the Enabled parameter to false using the AWS CLI or Amazon RDS API. 
Important
Amazon RDS doesn't guarantee the order of events sent in an event stream. The event order is subject to change.
Note
Amazon RDS event notifications using SMS text messages are currently available for topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon RDS resources in the US-East (Northern Virginia) Region. For more information on using text messages with SNS, see Sending and Receiving SMS Notifications Using Amazon SNS in the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide.
Amazon RDS uses the ARN of an Amazon SNS topic to identify each subscription. The Amazon RDS console creates the ARN for you when you create the subscription. If you use the CLI or API, you create the ARN by using the Amazon SNS console or the Amazon SNS API when you create a subscription.
Billing for Amazon RDS event notification is through the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). Amazon SNS fees apply when using event notification. For more information on Amazon SNS billing, see  Amazon Simple Notification Service Pricing.
The process for subscribing to Amazon RDS event notification is as follows:


Create an Amazon RDS event notification subscription by using the Amazon RDS console, AWS CLI, or API.


Amazon RDS sends an approval email or SMS message to the addresses you submitted with your subscription. To confirm your subscription, choose the link in the notification you were sent.


When you have confirmed the subscription, the status of your subscription is updated in the Amazon RDS console's My Event Subscriptions section.


You then begin to receive event notifications.


Note
When Amazon SNS sends a notification to a subscribed HTTP or HTTPS endpoint, the POST message sent to the endpoint has a message body that contains a JSON document. For more information, see Amazon SNS Message and JSON Formats in the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide.
You can use AWS Lambda to process event notifications from a DB instance. For more information, see Using AWS Lambda with Amazon RDS in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide.
The following section lists all categories and events that you can be notified of. It also provides information about subscribing to and working with Amazon RDS event subscriptions.
Amazon RDS Event Categories and Event Messages
Amazon RDS generates a significant number of events in categories that you can subscribe to using the Amazon RDS Console, AWS CLI, or the API. Each category applies to a source type, which can be a DB instance, DB snapshot, DB security group, or DB parameter group.
The following table shows the event category and a list of events when a DB instance is the source type.

Subscribing to Amazon RDS Event Notification
You can create an Amazon RDS event notification subscription so you can be notified when an event occurs for a given DB instance, DB snapshot, DB security group, or DB parameter group. The simplest way to create a subscription is with the RDS console. If you choose to create event notification subscriptions using the CLI or API, you must create an Amazon Simple Notification Service topic and subscribe to that topic with the Amazon SNS console or Amazon SNS API. You will also need to retain the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the topic because it is used when submitting CLI commands or API operations. For information on creating an SNS topic and subscribing to it, see Getting Started with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide.
You can specify the type of source you want to be notified of and the Amazon RDS source that triggers the event. These are defined by the SourceType (type of source) and the SourceIdentifier (the Amazon RDS source generating the event). If you specify both the SourceType and SourceIdentifier, such as SourceType = db-instance and SourceIdentifier = myDBInstance1, you receive all the DB instance events for the specified source. If you specify a SourceType but don't specify a SourceIdentifier, you receive notice of the events for that source type for all your Amazon RDS sources. If you don't specify either the SourceType or the SourceIdentifier, you are notified of events generated from all Amazon RDS sources belonging to your customer account.
Note
Event notifications might take up to five minutes to be delivered.
Amazon RDS event notification is only available for unencrypted SNS topics. If you specify an encrypted SNS topic, event notifications aren't sent for the topic.
Console
To subscribe to RDS event notification


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.


In navigation pane, choose Event subscriptions. 


In the Event subscriptions pane, choose Create event subscription.

For Name, enter a name for the event notification subscription.


For Send notifications to, choose an existing Amazon SNS ARN for an Amazon SNS topic, or choose create topic to enter the name of a topic and a list of recipients.


For Source type, choose a source type.


Choose Yes to enable the subscription. If you want to create the subscription but to not have notifications sent yet, choose No.


Depending on the source type you selected, choose the event categories and sources that you want to receive event notifications for.


Choose Create.


The Amazon RDS console indicates that the subscription is being created.
