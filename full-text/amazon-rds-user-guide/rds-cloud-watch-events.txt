Getting CloudWatch Events and Amazon EventBridge Events for Amazon RDS
Amazon CloudWatch Events and Amazon EventBridge both enable you to automate AWS services and respond to system events such as application availability issues or resource changes. Events from AWS services are delivered to CloudWatch Events and EventBridge nearly in real time. You can write simple rules to indicate which events interest you and what automated actions to take when an event matches a rule.
You can set a variety of targets—such as an AWS Lambda function or an Amazon SNS topic—which receive events in JSON format. For more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide and the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
For example, you can configure Amazon RDS to send events to CloudWatch Events or Amazon EventBridge whenever a DB instance is created or deleted.

Sending Amazon RDS Events to CloudWatch Events
You can create CloudWatch Events rules to send Amazon RDS events to CloudWatch Events.
Use the following steps to create a CloudWatch Events rule that triggers on an event emitted by an AWS service.
To create a rule that triggers on an event:


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


Under Events in the navigation pane, choose Rules.


Choose Create rule.


For Event Source, do the following:


Choose Event Pattern.


For Service Name, choose Relational Database Service (RDS).


For Event Type, choose the type of Amazon RDS resource that triggers the event. For example, if a DB instance triggers the event, choose RDS DB Instance Event.


For Targets, choose Add Target, then choose the CloudWatch log group. 


For Log Group, enter a name for the log group to store the events. 


Choose Configure details. For Rule definition, type a name and description for the rule. 


Choose Create rule.
