mysql.rds_start_replication_until_gtid
Initiates replication from an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance and stops replication immediately after the specified global transaction identifier (GTID).
Syntax
CALL mysql.rds_start_replication_until_gtid (
gtid
);
Parameters
gtid 
The GTID after which replication is to stop.
Usage Notes
The master user must run the mysql.rds_start_replication_until_gtid procedure.
For Amazon RDS MySQL 5.7, this procedure is supported for MySQL 5.7.23 and later MySQL 5.7 versions. This procedure is not supported for Amazon RDS MySQL 5.5, 5.6, or 8.0.
You can use this procedure with delayed replication for disaster recovery. If you have delayed replication configured, you can use this procedure to roll forward changes to a delayed read replica to the time just before a disaster. After this procedure stops replication, you can promote the read replica to be the new primary DB instance by using the instructions in Promoting a Read Replica to Be a Standalone DB Instance.
You can configure delayed replication using the following stored procedures:
 mysql.rds_set_configuration
 mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position
 mysql.rds_set_source_delay
When the gtid parameter specifies a transaction that has already been run by the replica, replication is stopped immediately.
Examples
The following example initiates replication and replicates changes until it reaches GTID 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:23.
call mysql.rds_start_replication_until_gtid('3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:23');
