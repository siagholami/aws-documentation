mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position
Configures an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance to be a read replica of an instance of MySQL running external to Amazon RDS. This procedure also configures delayed replication and replication based on global transaction identifiers (GTIDs).
Important
To run this procedure, autocommit must be enabled. To enable it, set the autocommit parameter to 1. For information about modifying parameters, see Modifying Parameters in a DB Parameter Group.
Syntax
CALL mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position (
  host_name
  , host_port
  , replication_user_name
  , replication_user_password
  , ssl_encryption
  , delay
);
Parameters
host_name 
The host name or IP address of the MySQL instance running external to Amazon RDS to become the source database instance.
host_port 
The port used by the MySQL instance running external to Amazon RDS to be configured as the source database instance. If your network configuration includes Secure Shell (SSH) port replication that converts the port number, specify the port number that is exposed by SSH.
replication_user_name 
The ID of a user with REPLICATION CLIENT and REPLICATION SLAVE permissions on the MySQL instance running external to Amazon RDS. We recommend that you provide an account that is used solely for replication with the external instance.
replication_user_password 
The password of the user ID specified in replication_user_name.
ssl_encryption 
A value that specifies whether Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption is used on the replication connection. 1 specifies to use SSL encryption, 0 specifies to not use encryption. The default is 0.
The MASTER_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT option isn't supported. This option is set to 0, which means that the connection is encrypted, but the certificates aren't verified.
delay 
The minimum number of seconds to delay replication from source database instance.
The limit for this parameter is one day (86,400 seconds).
Usage Notes
The master user must run the mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position procedure. This procedure must be run on the MySQL DB instance to be configured as the read replica of a MySQL instance running external to Amazon RDS. 
For Amazon RDS MySQL 5.7, this procedure is supported for MySQL 5.7.23 and later MySQL 5.7 versions. This procedure is not supported for Amazon RDS MySQL 5.5, 5.6, or 8.0.
Before you run mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position, you must configure the instance of MySQL running external to Amazon RDS to be a source database instance. To connect to the MySQL instance running external to Amazon RDS, you must specify values for replication_user_name and replication_user_password. These values must indicate a replication user that has REPLICATION CLIENT and REPLICATION SLAVE permissions on the external instance of MySQL. 
To configure an external instance of MySQL as a source database instance

Using the MySQL client of your choice, connect to the external instance of MySQL and create a user account to be used for replication. The following is an example.

CREATE USER 'repl_user'@'mydomain.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'SomePassW0rd'

On the external instance of MySQL, grant REPLICATION CLIENT and REPLICATION SLAVE privileges to your replication user. The following example grants REPLICATION CLIENT and REPLICATION SLAVE privileges on all databases for the 'repl_user' user for your domain.

GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl_user'@'mydomain.com' 
   IDENTIFIED BY 'SomePassW0rd'

Note
We recommend that you use read replicas to manage replication between two Amazon RDS DB instances when possible. When you do so, we recommend that you use only this and other replication-related stored procedures. These practices enable more complex replication topologies between Amazon RDS DB instances. We offer these stored procedures primarily to enable replication with MySQL instances running external to Amazon RDS. For information about managing replication between Amazon RDS DB instances, see Working with Read Replicas.
After calling mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position to configure an Amazon RDS DB instance as a read replica, you can call mysql.rds_start_replication on the read replica to start the replication process. You can call mysql.rds_reset_external_master to remove the read replica configuration.
When you call mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position, Amazon RDS records the time, the user, and an action of set master in the mysql.rds_history and mysql.rds_replication_status tables.
For disaster recovery, you can use this procedure with the mysql.rds_start_replication_until or mysql.rds_start_replication_until_gtid stored procedure. To roll forward changes to a delayed read replica to the time just before a disaster, you can run the mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position procedure. After the mysql.rds_start_replication_until_gtid procedure stops replication, you can promote the read replica to be the new primary DB instance by using the instructions in Promoting a Read Replica to Be a Standalone DB Instance. 
To use the mysql.rds_rds_start_replication_until_gtid procedure, GTID-based replication must be enabled. To skip a specific GTID-based transaction that is known to cause disaster, you can use the mysql.rds_skip_transaction_with_gtid stored procedure. For more information about working with GTID-based replication, see Using GTID-Based Replication for Amazon RDS MySQL.
Examples
When run on a MySQL DB instance, the following example configures the DB instance to be a read replica of an instance of MySQL running external to Amazon RDS. It sets the minimum replication delay to one hour (3,600 seconds) on the MySQL DB instance. A change from the MySQL source database instance running external to Amazon RDS is not applied on the MySQL DB instance read replica for at least one hour.
