Deleting a DB Instance
To delete a DB instance, you must do the following:
 Provide the name of the instance
 Enable or disable the option to take a final DB snapshot of the instance
 Enable or disable the option to retain automated backups
If the DB instance that you want to delete has a read replica, you should either promote the read replica or delete it. For more information, see Promoting a Read Replica to Be a Standalone DB Instance. 
Note
When the status for a DB instance is deleting, its CA certificate value doesn't appear in the RDS console or in output for AWS CLI commands or RDS API operations. For more information about CA certificates, see Using SSL/TLS to Encrypt a Connection to a DB Instance.
Deletion Protection
You can only delete instances that don't have deletion protection enabled. When you create or modify a DB instance, you have the option to enable deletion protection so that users can't delete the DB instance. Deletion protection is disabled by default for you when you use AWS CLI and API commands. Deletion protection is enabled for you when you use the AWS Management Console to create a production DB instance. However, Amazon RDS enforces deletion protection when you use the console, the CLI, or the API to delete a DB instance. To delete a DB instance that has deletion protection enabled, first modify the instance and disable deletion protection. Enabling or disabling deletion protection doesn't cause an outage.
Creating a Final Snapshot and Retaining Automated Backups
When you delete a DB instance, you can choose to do one or both of the following:
 Create a final DB snapshot.
   To be able to restore your deleted DB instance later, create a final DB snapshot. The final snapshot is retained, along with any manual snapshots that were taken.
   To delete a DB instance quickly, you can skip creating a final DB snapshot.
Note
You can't create a final DB snapshot of your DB instance if it has the status creating, failed, incompatible-restore, or incompatible-network. For more information, see DB Instance Status.
 Retain automated backups.
   Your automated backups are retained for the retention period that is set on the DB instance at the time when you delete it. This set retention period occurs whether or not you choose to create a final DB snapshot.
   If you don't choose to retain automated backups, your automated backups are deleted and can't be recovered after you delete the DB instance.
   You typically don't need to retain automated backups if you create a final DB snapshot.
   To delete a retained automated backup, follow the instructions in Deleting Retained Automated Backups.
Important
If you skip the final DB snapshot, to restore your DB instance do one of the following:
Use an earlier manual snapshot of the DB instance to restore the DB instance to that DB snapshot's point in time.
Retain automated backups. You can use them to restore your DB instance during your retention period, but not after your retention period has ended.
Note
Regardless of your choice, manual DB snapshots aren't deleted. For more information on snapshots, see Creating a DB Snapshot.
Deleting a DB Instance
You can delete a DB instance using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API. The time required to delete a DB instance can vary depending on the backup retention period (that is, how many backups to delete), how much data is deleted, and whether a final snapshot is taken.
Note
You can't delete a DB instance when deletion protection is enabled for it. For more information, see Deletion Protection.
You can disable deletion protection by modifying the DB instance. For more information, see Modifying an Amazon RDS DB Instance.
Console
To delete a DB instance


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.


In the navigation pane, choose Databases, and then choose the DB instance that you want to delete.


For Actions, choose Delete.

Choose Delete.


AWS CLI
To delete a DB instance by using the AWS CLI, call the delete-db-instance command with the following options:
 --db-instance-identifier
 --final-db-snapshot-identifier or --skip-final-snapshot
Example with a final snapshot and no retained automated backups
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  
aws rds delete-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --final-db-snapshot-identifier mydbinstancefinalsnapshot \
    --delete-automated-backups
For Windows:  
aws rds delete-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --final-db-snapshot-identifier mydbinstancefinalsnapshot ^
    --delete-automated-backups
Example with retained automated backups and no final snapshot
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  
aws rds delete-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --skip-final-snapshot \
    --no-delete-automated-backups
For Windows:  
aws rds delete-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --skip-final-snapshot ^
    --no-delete-automated-backups
RDS API
To delete a DB instance by using the Amazon RDS API, call the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDBInstance.html operation with the following parameters:
 DBInstanceIdentifier
 FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier or SkipFinalSnapshot
Example with a final snapshot and no retained automated backups
