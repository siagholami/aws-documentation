Working with MariaDB Replication in Amazon RDS
You usually use read replicas to configure replication between Amazon RDS DB instances. For general information about read replicas, see Working with Read Replicas. For specific information about working with read replicas on Amazon RDS MariaDB, see Working with MariaDB Read Replicas. 
You can also configure replication based on binary log coordinates for a MariaDB DB instance. For MariaDB instances, you can also configure replication based on global transaction IDs (GTIDs), which provides better crash safety. For more information, see Configuring GTID-Based Replication into an Amazon RDS MariaDB DB instance. 
The following are other replication options available with Amazon RDS MariaDB:
 You can set up replication between an Amazon RDS MariaDB DB instance and a MySQL or MariaDB instance that is external to Amazon RDS. For information about configuring replication with an external source, see Replication with a MySQL or MariaDB Instance Running External to Amazon RDS.
 You can configure replication to import databases from a MySQL or MariaDB instance that is external to Amazon RDS, or to export databases to such instances. For more information, see Importing Data to an Amazon RDS MySQL or MariaDB DB Instance with Reduced Downtime and Exporting Data from a MySQL DB Instance by Using Replication.
For any of these replication options, you can use either row-based replication, statement-based, or mixed replication. Row-based replication only replicates the changed rows that result from a SQL statement. Statement-based replication replicates the entire SQL statement. Mixed replication uses statement-based replication when possible, but switches to row-based replication when SQL statements that are unsafe for statement-based replication are run. In most cases, mixed replication is recommended. The binary log format of the DB instance determines whether replication is row-based, statement-based, or mixed. For information about setting the binary log format, see Binary Logging Format.
