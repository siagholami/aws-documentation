mysql.rds_start_replication
Initiates replication from a MySQL DB instance.
Note
You can use the mysql.rds_start_replication_until or mysql.rds_start_replication_until_gtid stored procedure to initiate replication from an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance and stop replication at the specified binary log file location.
Syntax
CALL mysql.rds_start_replication;
Usage Notes
The master user must run the mysql.rds_start_replication procedure.
If you are configuring replication to import data from an instance of MySQL running external to Amazon RDS, you call mysql.rds_start_replication on the read replica to start the replication process after you have called mysql.rds_set_external_master to build the replication configuration. For more information, see Restoring a Backup into an Amazon RDS MySQL DB Instance.
If you are configuring replication to export data to an instance of MySQL external to Amazon RDS, you call mysql.rds_start_replication and mysql.rds_stop_replication on the read replica to control some replication actions, such as purging binary logs. For more information, see Exporting Data from a MySQL DB Instance by Using Replication.
You can also call mysql.rds_start_replication on the read replica to restart any replication process that you previously stopped by calling mysql.rds_stop_replication. For more information, see Working with Read Replicas.
