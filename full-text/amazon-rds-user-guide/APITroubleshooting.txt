Retrieving Errors
Typically, you want your application to check whether a request generated an error before you spend any time processing results. The easiest way to find out if an error occurred is to look for an Error node in the response from the Amazon RDS API.
XPath syntax provides a simple way to search for the presence of an Error node, as well as an easy way to retrieve the error code and message. The following code snippet uses Perl and the XML::XPath module to determine if an error occurred during a request. If an error occurred, the code prints the first error code and message in the response. 
use XML::XPath; 
    my $xp = XML::XPath->new(xml =>$response); 
    if ( $xp->find("//Error") ) 
    {print "There was an error processing your request:\n", " Error code: ",
    $xp->findvalue("//Error[1]/Code"), "\n", " ",
    $xp->findvalue("//Error[1]/Message"), "\n\n"; }

 Check the structure of your request
Each Amazon RDS operation has a reference page in the Amazon RDS API Reference. Double-check that you are using parameters correctly. In order to give you ideas regarding what might be wrong, look at the sample requests or user scenarios to see if those examples are doing similar operations.
