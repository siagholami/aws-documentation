mysql.rds_stop_replication
Stops replication from a MySQL DB instance.
Syntax
CALL mysql.rds_stop_replication;
Usage Notes
The master user must run the mysql.rds_stop_replication procedure. 
If you are configuring replication to import data from an instance of MySQL running external to Amazon RDS, you call mysql.rds_stop_replication on the read replica to stop the replication process after the import has completed. For more information, see Restoring a Backup into an Amazon RDS MySQL DB Instance.
If you are configuring replication to export data to an instance of MySQL external to Amazon RDS, you call mysql.rds_start_replication and mysql.rds_stop_replication on the read replica to control some replication actions, such as purging binary logs. For more information, see Exporting Data from a MySQL DB Instance by Using Replication.
You can also use mysql.rds_stop_replication to stop replication between two Amazon RDS DB instances. You typically stop replication to perform a long running operation on the read replica, such as creating a large index on the read replica. You can restart any replication process that you stopped by calling mysql.rds_start_replication on the read replica. For more information, see Working with Read Replicas.
