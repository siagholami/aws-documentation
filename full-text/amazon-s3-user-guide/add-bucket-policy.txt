How do I add an S3 Bucket policy?
This section explains how to use the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) console to add a new bucket policy or edit an existing bucket policy. A bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. You add a bucket policy to a bucket to grant other AWS accounts or IAM users access permissions for the bucket and the objects in it. Object permissions apply only to the objects that the bucket owner creates. For more information about bucket policies, see Overview of Managing Access in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
For examples of Amazon S3 bucket policies, see Bucket Policy Examples in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. 
To create or edit a bucket policy


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to create a bucket policy for or whose bucket policy you want to edit.



Choose Permissions, and then choose Bucket Policy.



In the Bucket policy editor text box, type or copy and paste a new bucket policy, or edit an existing policy. The bucket policy is a JSON file. The text you type in the editor must be valid JSON.



Choose Save.
Note
Amazon S3 displays the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the bucket next to the Bucket policy editor title. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
Directly below the bucket policy editor text box is a link to the Policy Generator, which you can use to create a bucket policy.
