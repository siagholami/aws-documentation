How do I configure a request metrics filter?
There are three types of Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon S3: storage metrics, request metrics and replication. Storage metrics are reported once per day and are provided to all customers at no additional cost. Request metrics are available at 1 minute intervals after some latency to process, and metrics are billed at the standard CloudWatch rate. To get request metrics, you must opt into them by configuring them in the console or with the Amazon S3 API.
For more conceptual information about CloudWatch metrics for Amazon S3, see Monitoring Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
To filter request metrics on a subset of objects in a bucket


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that has the objects you want to get request metrics for.



Choose the Management tab. and then choose Metrics.



Choose Requests.



From Filters in the left-side pane, choose Add.



Provide a name for this metrics configuration.



Provide one or more prefixes or tags, separated by commas, in Prefix /tags that you want to monitor. From the drop down, select whether the value you provided is a tag or a prefix.



Choose Save.


You have now created a metrics configuration for request metrics on a subset of the objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. About 15 minutes after CloudWatch begins tracking these request metrics, you can see graphs for the metrics in both the Amazon S3 or CloudWatch consoles. You can also request metrics at the bucket level. For information, see How do I configure request metrics for an S3 Bucket?
