How do I configure request metrics for an S3 Bucket?
There are three types of Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon S3:
 Storage metrics are reported once per day and are provided to all customers at no additional cost.
 Replication metrics are available 15 minutes after enabling a replication rule with S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC). For more information, see How do I view replication metrics?
 Request metrics are available at 1-minute intervals after some latency to process, and the metrics are billed at the standard CloudWatch rate. 
For more information about CloudWatch metrics for Amazon S3, see Monitoring Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
To get request metrics, you must opt into them by configuring them on the AWS Management Console or using the Amazon S3 API.
To configure request metrics on a bucket


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that contains the objects you want request metrics for.



Choose the Management tab, and then choose Metrics.



Choose Requests.



In the left pane, choose the edit icon next to the name of the bucket.



Select the Request metrics check box. This also enables data transfer metrics.



Choose Save.


You have now created a metrics configuration for all the objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. About 15 minutes after CloudWatch begins tracking these request metrics, you can see graphs for the metrics on the Amazon S3 or CloudWatch console. 
You can also define a filter so that the metrics are only collected and reported on a subset of objects in the bucket. For more information, see How do I configure a request metrics filter?
