Creating a folder
This section describes how to use the Amazon S3 console to create a folder.
To create a folder


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to create a folder in.



Choose Create folder.



Enter a name for the folder (for example, favorite-pics). Choose the encryption setting for the folder object, and then choose Save.



If you don't want to use encryption with your folder, choose None. 


If you want to encrypt your object using keys that are managed by Amazon S3, follow these steps:


Choose AES-256. 
For more information about using Amazon S3 server-side encryption to encrypt your data, see Protecting data with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys classes in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.


If you want to encrypt your object using AWS KMS, follow these steps:


Choose AWS-KMS.


Choose an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK).
The list shows customer managed CMKs that you have created and your AWS managed CMK for Amazon S3. For more information about creating a customer managed AWS KMS CMK, see Creating Keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. 
Important
To encrypt objects in the bucket, you can use only the CMKs that are enabled in the same AWS Region as the bucket. Amazon S3 only supports symmetric CMKs and does not support asymmetric CMKs. For more information, see Using symmetric and asymmetric keys.
The Amazon S3 console only lists 100 KMS CMKs per Region. If you have more than 100 CMKs in the same Region, you can see only the first 100 CMKs in the S3 console. To use anAWS KMS KMS CMK that is not listed in the console, choose Custom KMS ARN, and enter the KMS CMK ARN.


Choose Save.
