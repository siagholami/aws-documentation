How do I lock an Amazon S3 object?
With S3 Object Lock, you can store objects in Amazon S3 using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. You can use S3 Object Lock to prevent an object from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. For information about object locking using the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, and the Amazon S3 REST APIs, see Locking Objects Using Object Lock in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
Before you lock any objects, you have to enable a bucket to use S3 Object Lock. You enable Object Lock when you create a bucket. After you enable Object Lock on a bucket, you can lock objects in that bucket. When you create a bucket with Object Lock enabled, you can't disable Object Lock or suspend versioning for that bucket. 
For information about creating a bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled, see How do I create an S3 Bucket?.
