CreateSolutionVersion
Trains or retrains an active solution. A solution is created using the CreateSolution operation and must be in the ACTIVE state before calling CreateSolutionVersion. A new version of the solution is created every time you call this operation.
Status 
A solution version can be in one of the following states:
 CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
To get the status of the version, call DescribeSolutionVersion. Wait until the status shows as ACTIVE before calling CreateCampaign.
If the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a failureReason key, which describes why the job failed.

}
Request Parameters
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 solutionArn  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution containing the training configuration information.
Type: String

Required: Yes
 trainingMode  
The scope of training to be performed when creating the solution version. The FULL option trains the solution version based on the entirety of the input solution's training data, while the UPDATE option processes only the data that has changed in comparison to the input solution. Choose UPDATE when you want to incrementally update your solution version instead of creating an entirely new one.
The UPDATE option can only be used when you already have an active solution version created from the input solution using the FULL option and the input solution was trained with the User-Personalization Recipe or the HRNN-Coldstart Recipe recipe.
