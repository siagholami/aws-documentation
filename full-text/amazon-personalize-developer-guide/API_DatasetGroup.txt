DatasetGroup
A dataset group is a collection of related datasets (Interactions, User, and Item). You create a dataset group by calling CreateDatasetGroup. You then create a dataset and add it to a dataset group by calling CreateDataset. The dataset group is used to create and train a solution by calling CreateSolution. A dataset group can contain only one of each type of dataset.
You can specify an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt the datasets in the group.
