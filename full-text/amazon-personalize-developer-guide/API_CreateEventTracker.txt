CreateEventTracker
Creates an event tracker that you use when sending event data to the specified dataset group using the PutEvents API.
When Amazon Personalize creates an event tracker, it also creates an event-interactions dataset in the dataset group associated with the event tracker. The event-interactions dataset stores the event data from the PutEvents call. The contents of this dataset are not available to the user.
Note
Only one event tracker can be associated with a dataset group. You will get an error if you call CreateEventTracker using the same dataset group as an existing event tracker.
When you send event data you include your tracking ID. The tracking ID identifies the customer and authorizes the customer to send the data.
The event tracker can be in one of the following states:
 CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
 DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS
To get the status of the event tracker, call DescribeEventTracker.
Note
The event tracker must be in the ACTIVE state before using the tracking ID.
