CreateDatasetImportJob
Creates a job that imports training data from your data source (an Amazon S3 bucket) to an Amazon Personalize dataset. To allow Amazon Personalize to import the training data, you must specify an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has permission to read from the data source, as Amazon Personalize makes a copy of your data and processes it in an internal AWS system.
Important
The dataset import job replaces any previous data in the dataset.
Status 
A dataset import job can be in one of the following states:
 CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
To get the status of the import job, call DescribeDatasetImportJob, providing the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset import job. The dataset import is complete when the status shows as ACTIVE. If the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a failureReason key, which describes why the job failed.
Note
Importing takes time. You must wait until the status shows as ACTIVE before training a model using the dataset.
