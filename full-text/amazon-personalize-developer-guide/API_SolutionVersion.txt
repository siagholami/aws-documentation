SolutionVersion
An object that provides information about a specific version of a Solution.
Contents
creationDateTime 
The date and time (in Unix time) that this version of the solution was created.
Type: Timestamp
Required: No
datasetGroupArn 
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group providing the training data.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: arn:([a-z\d-]):personalize:.*:.*:. 
Required: No
eventType 
The event type (for example, 'click' or 'like') that is used for training the model.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Required: No
failureReason 
If training a solution version fails, the reason for the failure.
Type: String
Required: No
lastUpdatedDateTime 
The date and time (in Unix time) that the solution was last updated.
Type: Timestamp
Required: No
performAutoML 
When true, Amazon Personalize searches for the most optimal recipe according to the solution configuration. When false (the default), Amazon Personalize uses recipeArn.
Type: Boolean
Required: No
performHPO 
Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO) on the chosen recipe. The default is false.
Type: Boolean
Required: No
recipeArn 
The ARN of the recipe used in the solution.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: arn:([a-z\d-]):personalize:.*:.*:. 
Required: No
solutionArn 
The ARN of the solution.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: arn:([a-z\d-]):personalize:.*:.*:. 
Required: No
solutionConfig 
Describes the configuration properties for the solution.
Type: SolutionConfig object
Required: No
solutionVersionArn 
The ARN of the solution version.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: arn:([a-z\d-]):personalize:.*:.*:. 
Required: No
status 
The status of the solution version.
A solution version can be in one of the following states:
 CREATE PENDING
 CREATE IN_PROGRESS
 ACTIVE
 CREATE FAILED
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Required: No
trainingHours 
The time used to train the model. You are billed for the time it takes to train a model. This field is visible only after Amazon Personalize successfully trains a model.
Type: Double
Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.
Required: No
trainingMode 
The scope of training used to create the solution version. The FULL option trains the solution version based on the entirety of the input solution's training data, while the UPDATE option processes only the training data that has changed since the creation of the last solution version. Choose UPDATE when you want to start recommending items added to the dataset without retraining the model.
The UPDATE option can only be used after you've created a solution version with the FULL option and the training solution uses the HRNN-Coldstart Recipe.
Type: String
Valid Values:FULL | UPDATE 
Required: No
tunedHPOParams 
If hyperparameter optimization was performed, contains the hyperparameter values of the best performing model.
Type: TunedHPOParams object
Required: No
