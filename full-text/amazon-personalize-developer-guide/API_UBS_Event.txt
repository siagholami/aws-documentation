Event
Represents user interaction event information sent using the PutEvents API.
Contents
eventId 
An ID associated with the event. If an event ID is not provided, Amazon Personalize generates a unique ID for the event. An event ID is not used as an input to the model. Amazon Personalize uses the event ID to distinquish unique events. Any subsequent events after the first with the same event ID are not used in model training.

properties 
A string map of event-specific data that you might choose to record. For example, if a user rates a movie on your site, other than movie ID (itemId) and rating (eventValue) , you might also send the number of movie ratings made by the user.
Each item in the map consists of a key-value pair. For example,
{"numberOfRatings": "12"} 
The keys use camel case names that match the fields in the Interactions schema. In the above example, the numberOfRatings would match the 'NUMBER_OF_RATINGS' field defined in the Interactions schema.
