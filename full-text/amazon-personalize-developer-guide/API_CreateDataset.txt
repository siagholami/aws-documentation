CreateDataset
Creates an empty dataset and adds it to the specified dataset group. Use CreateDatasetImportJob to import your training data to a dataset.
There are three types of datasets:
 Interactions
 Items
 Users
Each dataset type has an associated schema with required field types. Only the Interactions dataset is required in order to train a model (also referred to as creating a solution).
A dataset can be in one of the following states:
 CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
 DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS
To get the status of the dataset, call DescribeDataset.
