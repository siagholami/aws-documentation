Filtering Batch Recommendations
Filtering batch recommendations works nearly the same as filtering real-time recommendations. For both, you create a filter and then apply it to a CreateBatchInferenceJob operation create a batch inference job using the console (see Getting Batch Recommendations (Amazon Personalize Console)). Amazon Personalize removes filtered recommendations from the batch jobâ€™s output JSON file.
You can use either the console or the AWS SDKs to filter batch recommendations.
Filtering Batch Recommendations (Console)


Use the console or the SDK to create a filter. 


When you create the batch recommendation job, on the Create batch inference job page, for Filter configuration - optional, Filter name, choose the filter.



Filtering Batch Recommendations (AWS SDK)


Use the console or the SDK to create a filter. 


Include the FilterArn parameter in the CreateBatchInferenceJob request. 


```
import boto3
personalize = boto3.client('personalize')
personalize_rec.create_batch_inference_job (
    solutionVersionArn = "Solution version ARN",
    jobName = "Batch job name",
    roleArn = "IAM role ARN",
    filterArn = "Filter ARN",
    jobInput = 
        {"s3DataSource": {"path": "S3 input path"}},
    jobOutput = 
        {"S3DataDestination": {"path": "S3 output path"}}
)
```
