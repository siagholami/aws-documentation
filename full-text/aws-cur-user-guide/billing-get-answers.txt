Contacting Customer Support
Use the following resources to get help with your AWS Billing and Cost Management and AWS Cost and Usage Reports questions.
 AWS Knowledge Center: This is the quickest way to find answers to questions about your AWS CUR or bill. We recommend you start here.
 Account and Billing Support: If you're an AWS account owner, you have access to account and billing support free of charge. Only personalized technical support requires a support plan. For more information, visit the AWS Support web site.
 Opening a Support Case: You can contact AWS Support and open a support case for your inquiry. This is the most direct method for communicating with AWS Support. AWS Support does not publish a direct phone number to reach representatives, but instead will call you through the following procedure.
Note
To open an AWS Support case and specify Regarding: Account and Billing Support, you must either be signed into AWS as the root account owner, or have IAM permissions to open a support case. For more information, see Accessing AWS Support in the AWS Support User Guide.
