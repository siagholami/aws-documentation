Setting Up Athena Using AWS CloudFormation Templates
Important
Before moving on to this procedure, you must wait for the first AWS CUR to be delivered to your Amazon S3 bucket. It might take up to 8 hours for AWS to deliver your first report.
To use Athena, you must set up an AWS Glue crawler, an AWS Glue database, and an AWS Lambda event. Billing and Cost Management provides an AWS CloudFormation template that does this setup for you. Be sure to align the Region when using the template. This process shows how to use the Athena AWS CloudFormation template.
To use the Athena AWS CloudFormation template


Open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


From the list of buckets, choose your bucket name.


Navigate your folders until you find the .yml template file.


The .yml file is usually found in the prefix name folder, or report name folder. The location varies depending on how your report is formatted.


Select the .yml template file.


Select download.


Open the AWS CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation.


Choose Create New Stack if you have never used AWS CloudFormation before. Otherwise, choose Create Stack.


Under Prepare template, choose Template is ready.


Under Template source, choose Upload a template file.


Select Choose file.


Choose the downloaded .yml template, and then choose Open.


Choose Next.


For Stack name, enter a name for your template and choose Next.


Choose Next.


At the bottom of the page, select I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources. This template creates the following resources:
    Three IAM roles
    An AWS Glue database
    An AWS Glue crawler
    Two Lambda functions
    An Amazon S3 notification
