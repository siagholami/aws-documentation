Creating an Athena Table
AWS includes the SQL that you need to run to create this table in your AWS CUR bucket.
To create your Athena table


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


From the list of buckets, choose the bucket where you chose to receive your Cost and Usage Reports.


Navigate the path your-report-prefix-your-report-name-path-to-report.


The exact path depends on whether your AWS CUR is set to overwrite previous versions. For more information, see Cost and Usage Reports delivery timelineCost and Usage Reports formatting.


Open the file my-report-name-create-table.sql.


Copy the SQL from the file, starting with CREATE and ending with LOCATION 's3://your-report-prefix/your-report-name/the-rest-of-the=path'. Take note of the first line, as you need the database name and table to create the Athena database.


Open the Athena console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/.


In the New query 1 query pane, paste the following SQL. For <database name>.<table name>, use the database and table name from the first line of the SQL that you copied.


CREATE DATABASE <database name>


Choose Run query.


In the dropdown menu, choose the database that you just created.


In the New query 1 query pane, paste the rest of the SQL from the SQL file.


Choose Run query.


After you create your table, you need to load your partitions before you can run a query. For more information, see Column Names.
