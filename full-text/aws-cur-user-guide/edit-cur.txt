Editing Your Cost and Usage Reports Configuration
You can use the Cost & Usage Reports page in the Billing and Cost Management console to edit Cost and Usage Reports.
Note
Report names can't be edited. If you chose Overwrite for Report versioning, you're unable to edit the report name, whether the report includes resource IDs, time granularity, or the report versioning. If you delete a report set to Overwrite and create a new report with the same name, Amazon S3 bucket, and path prefix, your data could corrupt and become inaccurate.
To edit Cost and Usage Reports


Sign in to the Billing and Cost Management console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/


On the navigation pane, choose Cost & Usage Reports.


Select the report that you want to edit and choose Edit report.


(Versioned reports only) For Additional report details, select include resource IDs to add IDs for individual resources.


Select the Data refresh settings if you want AWS Cost and Usage Reports to refresh when AWS applies refunds, credits, or support fees to your account after your bill is finalized.


When a report refreshes, a new report is uploaded to Amazon S3.


Choose Next.


For S3 bucket, enter the name of the Amazon S3 bucket where you want the reports delivered.


Choose Verify.
Note
The bucket must have appropriate permissions to be valid. For more information on adding permissions to the bucket, see  Setting Bucket and Object Access Permissions in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide. 


For Report path prefix, enter the report path prefix that you want prepended to the name of your report. 


(Versioned reports only) For Time granularity, choose one of the following:
    Hourly: If you want the line items in the report to be aggregated by the hour.
    Daily: If you want the line items in the report to be aggregated by the day.


(Versioned reports only) For Report versioning, choose whether you want each version of the report to overwrite the previous version of the report, or to be delivered in addition to the previous versions.


For Enable report data integration for, select whether you want to upload your AWS CUR to Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon QuickSight. The report is compressed in the following formats:
    Athena: Parquet compression
    Amazon Redshift or Amazon QuickSight: .gz compression


Choose Save.
