Step 3: Download and Build the Code
This topic provides sample implementation code for the sample stock trades ingestion into the data stream (producer) and the processing of this data (consumer).
To download and build the code


Download the source code from the https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-kinesis-learning GitHub repo to your computer.


Create a project in your IDE with the source code, adhering to the provided directory structure.


Add the following libraries to the project:
    Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL)
    AWS SDK
    Apache HttpCore
    Apache HttpClient
    Apache Commons Lang
    Apache Commons Logging
    Guava (Google Core Libraries For Java)
    Jackson Annotations
    Jackson Core
    Jackson Databind
    Jackson Dataformat: CBOR
    Joda Time


Depending on your IDE, the project might be built automatically. If not, build the project using the appropriate steps for your IDE.


If you complete these steps successfully, you are now ready to move to the next section, Step 4: Implement the Producer.
