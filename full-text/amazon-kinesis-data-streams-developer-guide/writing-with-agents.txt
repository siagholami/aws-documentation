Writing to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Using Kinesis Agent
Kinesis Agent is a stand-alone Java software application that offers an easy way to collect and send data to Kinesis Data Streams. The agent continuously monitors a set of files and sends new data to your stream. The agent handles file rotation, checkpointing, and retry upon failures. It delivers all of your data in a reliable, timely, and simple manner. It also emits Amazon CloudWatch metrics to help you better monitor and troubleshoot the streaming process.
By default, records are parsed from each file based on the newline ('\n') character. However, the agent can also be configured to parse multi-line records (see Agent Configuration Settings). 
You can install the agent on Linux-based server environments such as web servers, log servers, and database servers. After installing the agent, configure it by specifying the files to monitor and the stream for the data. After the agent is configured, it durably collects data from the files and reliably sends it to the stream.

Prerequisites

Your operating system must be either Amazon Linux AMI with version 2015.09 or later, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7 or later.
If you are using Amazon EC2 to run your agent, launch your EC2 instance.
Manage your AWS credentials using one of the following methods:
Specify an IAM role when you launch your EC2 instance.
Specify AWS credentials when you configure the agent (see awsAccessKeyId and awsSecretAccessKey).
Edit /etc/sysconfig/aws-kinesis-agent to specify your region and AWS access keys.
If your EC2 instance is in a different AWS account, create an IAM role to provide access to the Kinesis Data Streams service, and specify that role when you configure the agent (see assumeRoleARN and assumeRoleExternalId). Use one of the previous methods to specify the AWS credentials of a user in the other account who has permission to assume this role.
The IAM role or AWS credentials that you specify must have permission to perform the Kinesis Data Streams PutRecords operation for the agent to send data to your stream. If you enable CloudWatch monitoring for the agent, permission to perform the CloudWatch PutMetricData operation is also needed. For more information, see Controlling Access to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Resources Using IAM, Monitoring Kinesis Data Streams Agent Health with Amazon CloudWatch, and CloudWatch Access Control.

Download and Install the Agent
First, connect to your instance. For more information, see Connect to Your Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. If you have trouble connecting, see Troubleshooting Connecting to Your Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
To set up the agent using the Amazon Linux AMI
Use the following command to download and install the agent:
sudo yum install –y aws-kinesis-agent
To set up the agent using Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Use the following command to download and install the agent:
sudo yum install –y https://s3.amazonaws.com/streaming-data-agent/aws-kinesis-agent-latest.amzn1.noarch.rpm
To set up the agent using GitHub


Download the agent from awlabs/amazon-kinesis-agent. 


Install the agent by navigating to the download directory and running the following command:


sudo ./setup --install
Configure and Start the Agent
To configure and start the agent

Open and edit the configuration file (as superuser if using default file access permissions): /etc/aws-kinesis/agent.json 

In this configuration file, specify the files ( "filePattern" ) from which the agent collects data, and the name of the stream ( "kinesisStream" ) to which the agent sends data. Note that the file name is a pattern, and the agent recognizes file rotations. You can rotate files or create new files no more than once per second. The agent uses the file creation timestamp to determine which files to track and tail into your stream; creating new files or rotating files more frequently than once per second does not allow the agent to differentiate properly between them.
{ 
      "flows": [
           { 
               "filePattern": "/tmp/app.log*", 
               "kinesisStream": "yourkinesisstream"
           } 
      ] 
   }

Start the agent manually:

sudo service aws-kinesis-agent start

(Optional) Configure the agent to start on system startup:

sudo chkconfig aws-kinesis-agent on
The agent is now running as a system service in the background. It continuously monitors the specified files and sends data to the specified stream. Agent activity is logged in /var/log/aws-kinesis-agent/aws-kinesis-agent.log. 
Agent Configuration Settings
The agent supports the two mandatory configuration settings, filePattern and kinesisStream, plus optional configuration settings for additional features. You can specify both mandatory and optional configuration in /etc/aws-kinesis/agent.json.
Whenever you change the configuration file, you must stop and start the agent, using the following commands:
sudo service aws-kinesis-agent stop
sudo service aws-kinesis-agent start
Alternatively, you could use the following command:
sudo service aws-kinesis-agent restart
The following are the general configuration settings.



Configuration Setting
Description




assumeRoleARN
The ARN of the role to be assumed by the user. For more information, see Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts Using IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide.


assumeRoleExternalId
An optional identifier that determines who can assume the role. For more information, see How to Use an External ID in the IAM User Guide.


awsAccessKeyId
AWS access key ID that overrides the default credentials. This setting takes precedence over all other credential providers.


awsSecretAccessKey
AWS secret key that overrides the default credentials. This setting takes precedence over all other credential providers.


cloudwatch.emitMetrics
Enables the agent to emit metrics to CloudWatch if set (true). Default: true


cloudwatch.endpoint
The regional endpoint for CloudWatch. Default: monitoring.us-east-1.amazonaws.com


kinesis.endpoint
The regional endpoint for Kinesis Data Streams. Default: kinesis.us-east-1.amazonaws.com



The following are the flow configuration settings.



Configuration Setting
Description




dataProcessingOptions
The list of processing options applied to each parsed record before it is sent to the stream. The processing options are performed in the specified order. For more information, see Use the Agent to Pre-process Data.


kinesisStream
[Required] The name of the stream.


filePattern
[Required] A glob for the files that must be monitored by the agent. Any file that matches this pattern is picked up by the agent automatically and monitored. For all files matching this pattern, read permission must be granted to aws-kinesis-agent-user. For the directory containing the files, read and execute permissions must be granted to aws-kinesis-agent-user.


initialPosition
The initial position from which the file started to be parsed. Valid values are START_OF_FILE and END_OF_FILE. Default: END_OF_FILE


maxBufferAgeMillis
The maximum time, in milliseconds, for which the agent buffers data before sending it to the stream. Value range: 1,000 to 900,000 (1 second to 15 minutes) Default: 60,000 (1 minute)


maxBufferSizeBytes
The maximum size, in bytes, for which the agent buffers data before sending it to the stream. Value range: 1 to 4,194,304 (4 MB) Default: 4,194,304 (4 MB)

minTimeBetweenFilePollsMillis
The time interval, in milliseconds, at which the agent polls and parses the monitored files for new data. Value range: 1 or more Default: 100


multiLineStartPattern
The pattern for identifying the start of a record. A record is made of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that don't match the pattern. The valid values are regular expressions. By default, each new line in the log files is parsed as one record.


partitionKeyOption
The method for generating the partition key. Valid values are RANDOM (randomonly generated integer) and DETERMINISTIC (a hash value computed from the data). Default: RANDOM


skipHeaderLines
The number of lines for the agent to skip parsing at the beginning of monitored files. Value range: 0 or more Default: 0 (zero)


truncatedRecordTerminator
The string that the agent uses to truncate a parsed record when the record size exceeds the Kinesis Data Streams record size limit. (1,000 KB) Default: '\n' (newline)



Monitor Multiple File Directories and Write to Multiple Streams
By specifying multiple flow configuration settings, you can configure the agent to monitor multiple file directories and send data to multiple streams. In the following configuration example, the agent monitors two file directories and sends data to an Kinesis stream and a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream respectively. Note that you can specify different endpoints for Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Data Firehose so that your Kinesis stream and Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream don’t need to be in the same region.
{
    "cloudwatch.emitMetrics": true,
    "kinesis.endpoint": "https://your/kinesis/endpoint", 
    "firehose.endpoint": "https://your/firehose/endpoint", 
    "flows": [
        {
            "filePattern": "/tmp/app1.log*", 
            "kinesisStream": "yourkinesisstream"
        }, 
        {
            "filePattern": "/tmp/app2.log*",
            "deliveryStream": "yourfirehosedeliverystream" 
        }
    ] 
}
For more detailed information about using the agent with Kinesis Data Firehose, see Writing to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Kinesis Agent.
Use the Agent to Pre-process Data
The agent can pre-process the records parsed from monitored files before sending them to your stream. You can enable this feature by adding the dataProcessingOptions configuration setting to your file flow. One or more processing options can be added and they will be performed in the specified order.
The agent supports the following processing options listed. Because the agent is open-source, you can further develop and extend its processing options. You can download the agent from Kinesis Agent.Processing Options
SINGLELINE
Converts a multi-line record to a single line record by removing newline characters, leading spaces, and trailing spaces.  
{
    "optionName": "SINGLELINE"
}
CSVTOJSON
Converts a record from delimiter separated format to JSON format.  
{
    "optionName": "CSVTOJSON",
    "customFieldNames": [ "field1", "field2", ... ],
    "delimiter": "yourdelimiter"
}
customFieldNames
[Required] The field names used as keys in each JSON key value pair. For example, if you specify ["f1", "f2"], the record "v1, v2" will be converted to {"f1":"v1","f2":"v2"}.
delimiter
The string used as the delimiter in the record. The default is a comma (,).
LOGTOJSON
Converts a record from a log format to JSON format. The supported log formats are Apache Common Log, Apache Combined Log, Apache Error Log, and RFC3164 Syslog.  
{
    "optionName": "LOGTOJSON",
    "logFormat": "logformat",
    "matchPattern": "yourregexpattern",
    "customFieldNames": [ "field1", "field2", … ]
}
logFormat
[Required] The log entry format. The following are possible values:
 COMMONAPACHELOG — The Apache Common Log format. Each log entry has the following pattern by default: "%{host} %{ident} %{authuser} [%{datetime}] \"%{request}\" %{response} %{bytes}".
 COMBINEDAPACHELOG — The Apache Combined Log format. Each log entry has the following pattern by default: "%{host} %{ident} %{authuser} [%{datetime}] \"%{request}\" %{response} %{bytes} %{referrer} %{agent}".
 APACHEERRORLOG — The Apache Error Log format. Each log entry has the following pattern by default: "[%{timestamp}] [%{module}:%{severity}] [pid %{processid}:tid %{threadid}] [client: %{client}] %{message}".
 SYSLOG — The RFC3164 Syslog format. Each log entry has the following pattern by default: "%{timestamp} %{hostname} %{program}[%{processid}]: %{message}".
matchPattern
The regular expression pattern used to extract values from log entries. This setting is used if your log entry is not in one of the predefined log formats. If this setting is used, you must also specify customFieldNames.
customFieldNames
The custom field names used as keys in each JSON key value pair. You can use this setting to define field names for values extracted from matchPattern, or override the default field names of predefined log formats.
Example : LOGTOJSON Configuration 
Here is one example of a LOGTOJSON configuration for an Apache Common Log entry converted to JSON format:  
{
    "optionName": "LOGTOJSON",
    "logFormat": "COMMONAPACHELOG"
}
Before conversion:  
64.242.88.10 - - [07/Mar/2004:16:10:02 -0800] "GET /mailman/listinfo/hsdivision HTTP/1.1" 200 6291
After conversion:  
{"host":"64.242.88.10","ident":null,"authuser":null,"datetime":"07/Mar/2004:16:10:02 -0800","request":"GET /mailman/listinfo/hsdivision HTTP/1.1","response":"200","bytes":"6291"}
Example : LOGTOJSON Configuration With Custom Fields 
Here is another example LOGTOJSON configuration:  
{
    "optionName": "LOGTOJSON",
    "logFormat": "COMMONAPACHELOG",
    "customFieldNames": ["f1", "f2", "f3", "f4", "f5", "f6", "f7"]
}
With this configuration setting, the same Apache Common Log entry from the previous example is converted to JSON format as follows:  
{"f1":"64.242.88.10","f2":null,"f3":null,"f4":"07/Mar/2004:16:10:02 -0800","f5":"GET /mailman/listinfo/hsdivision HTTP/1.1","f6":"200","f7":"6291"}
Example : Convert Apache Common Log Entry 
The following flow configuration converts an Apache Common Log entry to a single line record in JSON format:  
{ 
    "flows": [
        {
            "filePattern": "/tmp/app.log*", 
            "kinesisStream": "my-stream",
            "dataProcessingOptions": [
                {
                    "optionName": "LOGTOJSON",
                    "logFormat": "COMMONAPACHELOG"
                }
            ]
        }
    ] 
}
Example : Convert Multi-Line Records 
The following flow configuration parses multi-line records whose first line starts with "[SEQUENCE=". Each record is first converted to a single line record. Then, values are extracted from the record based on a tab delimiter. Extracted values are mapped to specified customFieldNames values to form a single-line record in JSON format.  
{ 
    "flows": [
        {
            "filePattern": "/tmp/app.log*", 
            "kinesisStream": "my-stream",
            "multiLineStartPattern": "\\[SEQUENCE=",
            "dataProcessingOptions": [
                {
                    "optionName": "SINGLELINE"
                },
                {
                    "optionName": "CSVTOJSON",
                    "customFieldNames": [ "field1", "field2", "field3" ],
                    "delimiter": "\\t"
                }
            ]
        }
    ] 
}
Example : LOGTOJSON Configuration with Match Pattern 
Here is one example of a LOGTOJSON configuration for an Apache Common Log entry converted to JSON format, with the last field (bytes) omitted:  
{
    "optionName": "LOGTOJSON",
    "logFormat": "COMMONAPACHELOG",
    "matchPattern": "^([\\d.]) (\\S) (\\S) \\[([\\w:/]\\s[\\-]\\d{4})\\] \"(.?)\" (\\d{3})",
    "customFieldNames": ["host", "ident", "authuser", "datetime", "request", "response"]
}
Before conversion:  
123.45.67.89 - - [27/Oct/2000:09:27:09 -0400] "GET /java/javaResources.html HTTP/1.0" 200
After conversion:  
{"host":"123.45.67.89","ident":null,"authuser":null,"datetime":"27/Oct/2000:09:27:09 -0400","request":"GET /java/javaResources.html HTTP/1.0","response":"200"}
