Creating and Updating Data Streams
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams ingests a large amount of data in real time, durably stores the data, and makes the data available for consumption. The unit of data stored by Kinesis Data Streams is a data record. A data stream represents a group of data records. The data records in a data stream are distributed into shards.
A shard has a sequence of data records in a stream. When you create a stream, you specify the number of shards for the stream. The total capacity of a stream is the sum of the capacities of its shards. You can increase or decrease the number of shards in a stream as needed. However, you are charged on a per-shard basis. For information about the capacities and limits of a shard, see Kinesis Data Streams Limits.
A producer puts data records into shards and a consumer gets data records from shards.
Determining the Initial Size of a Kinesis Data Stream
Before you create a stream, you need to determine an initial size for the stream. After you create the stream, you can dynamically scale your shard capacity up or down using the AWS Management Console or the UpdateShardCount API. You can make updates while there is a Kinesis Data Streams application consuming data from the stream.
To determine the initial size of a stream, you need the following input values:
 The average size of the data record written to the stream in kilobytes (KB), rounded up to the nearest 1 KB, the data size (average_data_size_in_KB).
 The number of data records written to and read from the stream per second (records_per_second).
 The number of Kinesis Data Streams applications that consume data concurrently and independently from the stream, that is, the consumers (number_of_consumers).
 The incoming write bandwidth in KB (incoming_write_bandwidth_in_KB), which is equal to the average_data_size_in_KB multiplied by the records_per_second.
 The outgoing read bandwidth in KB (outgoing_read_bandwidth_in_KB), which is equal to the incoming_write_bandwidth_in_KB multiplied by the number_of_consumers.
You can calculate the initial number of shards (number_of_shards) that your stream needs by using the input values in the following formula:
number_of_shards = max(incoming_write_bandwidth_in_KiB/1024, outgoing_read_bandwidth_in_KiB/2048)
Creating a Stream
You can create a stream using the Kinesis Data Streams console, the Kinesis Data Streams API, or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
To create a data stream using the console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Kinesis console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis.


In the navigation bar, expand the Region selector and choose a Region.


Choose Create data stream.


On the Create Kinesis stream page, enter a name for your stream and the number of shards you need, and then click Create Kinesis stream.


On the Kinesis streams page, your stream's Status is Creating while the stream is being created. When the stream is ready to use, the Status changes to Active.

Choose the name of your stream. The Stream Details page displays a summary of your stream configuration, along with monitoring information.

To create a stream using the Kinesis Data Streams API
 For information about creating a stream using the Kinesis Data Streams API, see Creating a Stream.
To create a stream using the AWS CLI
 For information about creating a stream using the AWS CLI, see the create-stream command.
Updating a Stream
You can update the details of a stream using the Kinesis Data Streams console, the Kinesis Data Streams API, or the AWS CLI.
Note
You can enable server-side encryption for existing streams, or for streams that you have recently created.

To update a data stream using the console


Open the Amazon Kinesis console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/.


In the navigation bar, expand the Region selector and choose a Region.


Choose the name of your stream in the list. The Stream Details page displays a summary of your stream configuration and monitoring information.


To edit the number of shards, choose Edit in the Shards section, and then enter a new shard count.


To enable server-side encryption of data records, choose Edit in the Server-side encryption section. Choose a KMS key to use as the master key for encryption, or use the default master key, aws/kinesis, managed by Kinesis. If you enable encryption for a stream and use your own AWS KMS master key, ensure that your producer and consumer applications have access to the AWS KMS master key that you used. To assign permissions to an application to access a user-generated AWS KMS key, see Permissions to Use User-Generated KMS Master Keys.


To edit the data retention period, choose Edit in the Data retention period section, and then enter a new data retention period.


If you have enabled custom metrics on your account, choose Edit in the Shard level metrics section, and then specify metrics for your stream. For more information, see Monitoring the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Service with Amazon CloudWatch.


Updating a Stream Using the API
