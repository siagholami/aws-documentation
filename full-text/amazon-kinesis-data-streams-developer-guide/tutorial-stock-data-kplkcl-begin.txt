Prerequisites
The following are requirements for completing the Tutorial: Process Real-Time Stock Data Using KPL and KCL 1.x[Tutorial: Process Real-Time Stock Data Using KPL and KCL 1.x](tutorial-stock-data-kplkcl.md).
Amazon Web Services Account
Before you begin, ensure that you are familiar with the concepts discussed in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Terminology and Concepts, particularly streams, shards, producers, and consumers. It is also helpful to have completed Install and Configure the AWS CLI.
You need an AWS account and a web browser to access the AWS Management Console.
For console access, use your IAM user name and password to sign in to the AWS Management Console from the IAM sign-in page. IAM lets you securely control access to AWS services and resources in your AWS account. For details about console and programmatic credentials, see Understanding and Getting Your Security Credentials in the AWS General Reference.
For more information about IAM and security key setup instructions, see Create an IAM User.
System Software Requirements
The system used to run the application must have Java 7 or higher installed. To download and install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK), go to Oracle's Java SE installation site.
If you have a Java IDE, such as Eclipse, you can open the source code, edit, build, and run it.
You need the latest AWS SDK for Java version. If you are using Eclipse as your IDE, you can install the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse instead. 
The consumer application requires the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) version 1.2.1 or higher, which you can obtain from GitHub at Kinesis Client Library (Java).
