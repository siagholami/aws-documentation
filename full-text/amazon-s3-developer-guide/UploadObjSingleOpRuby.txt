Upload an object using the AWS SDK for Ruby
The AWS SDK for Ruby - Version 3 has two ways of uploading an object to Amazon S3. The first uses a managed file uploader, which makes it easy to upload files of any size from disk. To use the managed file uploader method:


Create an instance of the Aws::S3::Resource class.


Reference the target object by bucket name and key. Objects live in a bucket and have unique keys that identify each object.


Call#upload_file on the object.


Example 
```
require 'aws-sdk-s3'
s3 = Aws::S3::Resource.new(region:'us-west-2')
obj = s3.bucket('bucket-name').object('key')
obj.upload_file('/path/to/source/file')
```
The second way that AWS SDK for Ruby - Version 3 can upload an object uses the #put method of Aws::S3::Object. This is useful if the object is a string or an I/O object that is not a file on disk. To use this method:


Create an instance of the Aws::S3::Resource class.


Reference the target object by bucket name and key.


Call#put, passing in the string or I/O object.


Example 
```
require 'aws-sdk-s3'
s3 = Aws::S3::Resource.new(region:'us-west-2')
obj = s3.bucket('bucket-name').object('key')
I/O object
File.open('/path/to/source.file', 'rb') do |file|
  obj.put(body: file)
end
```
