API support for multipart upload
You can use an AWS SDK to upload an object in parts. The following AWS SDK libraries support multipart upload:
 AWS SDK for Java 
 AWS SDK for .NET
 AWS SDK for PHP
 AWS SDK for Ruby
 AWS SDK for Python (Boto)
 AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js
These libraries provide a high-level abstraction that makes uploading multipart objects easy. However, if your application requires, you can use the REST API directly. The following sections in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference describe the REST API for multipart upload.
