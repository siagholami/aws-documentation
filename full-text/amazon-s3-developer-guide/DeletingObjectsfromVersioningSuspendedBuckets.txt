Deleting objects from versioning-suspended buckets
If versioning is suspended, a DELETE request:
 Can only remove an object whose version ID is null
Doesn't remove anything if there isn't a null version of the object in the bucket.
 Inserts a delete marker into the bucket.
The following figure shows how a simple DELETE removes a null version and Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker in its place with a version ID of null.

Remember that a delete marker doesn't have content, so you lose the content of the null version when a delete marker replaces it.
The following figure shows a bucket that doesn't have a null version. In this case, the DELETE removes nothing; Amazon S3 just inserts a delete marker.

Even in a versioning-suspended bucket, the bucket owner can permanently delete a specified version. The following figure shows that deleting a specified object version permanently removes that object. Only the bucket owner can delete a specified object version.
