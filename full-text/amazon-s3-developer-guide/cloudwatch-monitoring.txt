Monitoring metrics with Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon S3 can help you understand and improve the performance of applications that use Amazon S3. There are several ways that you can use CloudWatch with Amazon S3.
 Daily storage metrics for buckets ‐ Monitor bucket storage using CloudWatch, which collects and processes storage data from Amazon S3 into readable, daily metrics. These storage metrics for Amazon S3 are reported once per day and are provided to all customers at no additional cost.
 Request metrics ‐ Monitor Amazon S3 requests to quickly identify and act on operational issues. The metrics are available at 1-minute intervals after some latency to process. These CloudWatch metrics are billed at the same rate as the Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics. For information about CloudWatch pricing, see Amazon CloudWatch pricing. To learn how to opt in to getting these metrics, see Metrics configurations for buckets.
When enabled, request metrics are reported for all object operations. By default, these 1-minute metrics are available at the Amazon S3 bucket level. You can also define a filter for the metrics collected using a shared prefix or object tag. This allows you to align metrics filters to specific business applications, workflows, or internal organizations.
 Replication metrics ‐ Monitor the total number of S3 API operations that are pending replication, the total size of objects pending replication, and the maximum replication time to the destination Region. Only replication rules that have S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) enabled will publish replication metrics. 
Unlike request metrics, you can't filter replication metrics by prefixes and tags. However, you can set up a replication rule based on prefixes and tags. Your replication metrics will then monitor replication for the prefixes and tags that you specified. For more information, see Meet compliance requirements using S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).
All CloudWatch statistics are retained for a period of 15 months so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing. For more information, see What Is Amazon CloudWatch? in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Metrics and dimensions
The storage metrics and dimensions that Amazon S3 sends to CloudWatch are listed below.
Amazon S3 CloudWatch Daily Storage Metrics for Buckets
The AWS/S3 namespace includes the following daily storage metrics for buckets.



Metric
Description




BucketSizeBytes
The amount of data in bytes stored in a bucket in the STANDARD storage class, INTELLIGENT_TIERING storage class, Standard - Infrequent Access (STANDARD_IA) storage class, OneZone - Infrequent Access (ONEZONE_IA), Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) class, Deep Archive Storage (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) class or, Glacier (GLACIER) storage class. This value is calculated by summing the size of all objects in the bucket (both current and noncurrent objects), including the size of all parts for all incomplete multipart uploads to the bucket.  Valid storage type filters: StandardStorage, IntelligentTieringStorage, StandardIAStorage, StandardIASizeOverhead, StandardIAObjectOverhead, OneZoneIAStorage, OneZoneIASizeOverhead, ReducedRedundancyStorage, GlacierStorage, GlacierStagingStorage, GlacierObjectOverhead, GlacierS3ObjectOverhead, DeepArchiveStorage, DeepArchiveObjectOverhead, DeepArchiveS3ObjectOverhead and, DeepArchiveStagingStorage (see the StorageType dimension)  Units: Bytes Valid statistics: Average


NumberOfObjects
The total number of objects stored in a bucket for all storage classes except for the GLACIER storage class. This value is calculated by counting all objects in the bucket (both current and noncurrent objects) and the total number of parts for all incomplete multipart uploads to the bucket. Valid storage type filters: AllStorageTypes (see the StorageType dimension) Units: Count Valid statistics: Average



Amazon S3 CloudWatch Request Metrics
The AWS/S3 namespace includes the following request metrics.

Amazon S3 CloudWatch replication metrics
Monitor the total number of S3 API operations that are pending replication, the total size of objects pending replication, and the maximum replication time to the destination Region. Only replication rules that have S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) enabled can publish replication metrics.
Unlike CloudWatch request metrics, you can't filter replication metrics by prefixes or tags. However, you can set up a replication rule based on prefixes and tags. Your replication metrics then monitor replication for the prefixes and tags that you specified. For more information, see Meet compliance requirements using S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).
Note
You can enable alarms for your replication metrics on Amazon CloudWatch. When you set up alarms for your replication metrics, set the Missing data treatment field to Treat missing data as ignore (maintain the alarm state).



Metric
Description




ReplicationLatency
The maximum number of seconds by which the replication destination Region is behind the source Region for a given replication rule.  Units: Seconds Valid statistics: Max


BytesPendingReplication
The total number of bytes of objects pending replication for a given replication rule. Units: Bytes Valid statistics: Max


OperationsPendingReplication
The number of operations pending replication for a given replication rule. Units: Counts Valid statistics: Max



Amazon S3 CloudWatch Dimensions
The following dimensions are used to filter Amazon S3 metrics.



Dimension
Description




BucketName
This dimension filters the data you request for the identified bucket only.


StorageType
This dimension filters the data that you have stored in a bucket by the following types of storage:  [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


FilterId
This dimension filters metrics configurations that you specify for request metrics on a bucket, for example, a prefix or a tag. You specify a filter id when you create a metrics configuration. For more information, see Metrics Configurations for Buckets.



Accessing CloudWatch metrics
You can use the following procedures to view the storage metrics for Amazon S3. To get the Amazon S3 metrics involved, you must set a start and end timestamp. For metrics for any given 24-hour period, set the time period to 86400 seconds, the number of seconds in a day. Also, remember to set the BucketName and StorageType dimensions.
For example, if you use the AWS CLI to get the average of a specific bucket's size in bytes, you could use the following command.
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --metric-name BucketSizeBytes --namespace AWS/S3 --start-time 2016-10-19T00:00:00Z --end-time 2016-10-20T00:00:00Z --statistics Average --unit Bytes --region us-west-2 --dimensions Name=BucketName,Value=ExampleBucket Name=StorageType,Value=StandardStorage --period 86400 --output json
This example produces the following output.
{
    "Datapoints": [
        {
            "Timestamp": "2016-10-19T00:00:00Z", 
            "Average": 1025328.0, 
            "Unit": "Bytes"
        }
    ], 
    "Label": "BucketSizeBytes"
}
