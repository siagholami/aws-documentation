Amazon S3 analytics â€“ Storage Class Analysis
By using Amazon S3 analytics Storage Class Analysis you can analyze storage access patterns to help you decide when to transition the right data to the right storage class. This new Amazon S3 analytics feature observes data access patterns to help you determine when to transition less frequently accessed STANDARD storage to the STANDARD_IA (IA, for infrequent access) storage class. For more information about storage classes, see Amazon S3 storage classes. 
After storage class analysis observes the infrequent access patterns of a filtered set of data over a period of time, you can use the analysis results to help you improve your lifecycle policies. You can configure storage class analysis to analyze all the objects in a bucket. Or, you can configure filters to group objects together for analysis by common prefix (that is, objects that have names that begin with a common string), by object tags, or by both prefix and tags. You'll most likely find that filtering by object groups is the best way to benefit from storage class analysis. 
Important
Storage class analysis does not give recommendations for transitions to the ONEZONE_IA or S3 Glacier storage classes.
You can have multiple storage class analysis filters per bucket, up to 1,000, and will receive a separate analysis for each filter. Multiple filter configurations allow you analyze specific groups of objects to improve your lifecycle policies that transition objects to STANDARD_IA. 
Storage class analysis provides storage usage visualizations in the Amazon S3 console that are updated daily. You can also export this daily usage data to an S3 bucket and view them in a spreadsheet application, or with business intelligence tools, like Amazon QuickSight.
There are costs associated with the storage class analysis. For pricing information, see Management and replication Amazon S3 pricing.

How do I set up storage class analysis?
You set up storage class analysis by configuring what object data you want to analyze. You can configure storage class analysis to do the following:
 Analyze the entire contents of a bucket.
You'll receive an analysis for all the objects in the bucket.
 Analyze objects grouped together by prefix and tags.
You can configure filters that group objects together for analysis by prefix, or by object tags, or by a combination of prefix and tags. You receive a separate analysis for each filter you configure. You can have multiple filter configurations per bucket, up to 1,000. 
 Export analysis data. 
When you configure storage class analysis for a bucket or filter, you can choose to have the analysis data exported to a file each day. The analysis for the day is added to the file to form a historic analysis log for the configured filter. The file is updated daily at the destination of your choice. When selecting data to export, you specify a destination bucket and optional destination prefix where the file is written.
You can use the Amazon S3 console, the REST API, or the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to configure storage class analysis.
 For information about how to configure storage class analysis in the Amazon S3 console, see  How Do I Configure Storage Class Analysis?.
 To use the Amazon S3 API, use the PutBucketAnalyticsConfiguration REST API, or the equivalent, from the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs. 
How do I use storage class analysis?
You use storage class analysis to observe your data access patterns over time to gather information to help you improve the lifecycle management of your STANDARD_IA storage. After you configure a filter, you'll start seeing data analysis based on the filter in the Amazon S3 console in 24 to 48 hours. However, storage class analysis observes the access patterns of a filtered data set for 30 days or longer to gather information for analysis before giving a result. The analysis continues to run after the initial result and updates the result as the access patterns change
When you first configure a filter the Amazon S3 console shows a message similar to the following.

Storage class analysis observes the access patterns of a filtered object data set for 30 days or longer to gather enough information for the analysis. After storage class analysis has gathered sufficient information, you'll see a message in the Amazon S3 console similar to the following.

When performing the analysis for infrequently accessed objects storage class analysis looks at the filtered set of objects grouped together based on age since they were uploaded to Amazon S3. Storage class analysis determines if the age group is infrequently accessed by looking at the following factors for the filtered data set:
 Objects in the STANDARD storage class that are larger than 128 KB.
 How much average total storage you have per age group.
 Average number of bytes transferred out (not frequency) per age group.
 Analytics export data only includes requests with data relevant to storage class analysis. This might cause differences in the number of requests, and the total upload and request bytes compared to what are shown in storage metrics or tracked by your own internal systems.
 Failed GET and PUT requests are not counted for the analysis. However, you will see failed requests in storage metrics. 
How Much of My Storage did I Retrieve?
The Amazon S3 console graphs how much of the storage in the filtered data set has been retrieved for the observation period as shown in the following example.

What Percentage of My Storage did I Retrieve?
The Amazon S3 console also graphs what percentage of the storage in the filtered data set has been retrieved for the observation period as shown in the following example.

As stated earlier in this topic, when you are performing the analysis for infrequently accessed objects, storage class analysis looks at the filtered set of objects grouped together based on the age since they were uploaded to Amazon S3. The storage class analysis uses the following predefined object age groups: 
 Amazon S3 Objects less than 15 days old
 Amazon S3 Objects 15-29 days old
 Amazon S3 Objects 30-44 days old
 Amazon S3 Objects 45-59 days old
 Amazon S3 Objects 60-74 days old
 Amazon S3 Objects 75-89 days old
 Amazon S3 Objects 90-119 days old
 Amazon S3 Objects 120-149 days old
 Amazon S3 Objects 150-179 days old
 Amazon S3 Objects 180-364 days old
 Amazon S3 Objects 365-729 days old
 Amazon S3 Objects 730 days and older
Usually it takes about 30 days of observing access patterns to gather enough information for an analysis result. It might take longer than 30 days, depending on the unique access pattern of your data. However, after you configure a filter you'll start seeing data analysis based on the filter in the Amazon S3 console in 24 to 48 hours. You can see analysis on a daily basis of object access broken down by object age group in the Amazon S3 console. 
How Much of My Storage is Infrequently Accessed?
The Amazon S3 console shows the access patterns grouped by the predefined object age groups as shown in the following example.

The Frequently accessed or Infrequently accessed text shown is meant as a visual aid to help you in the lifecycle creation process.
How can I export storage class analysis data?
You can choose to have storage class analysis export analysis reports to a comma-separated values (CSV) flat file. Reports are updated daily and are based on the object age group filters you configure. When using the Amazon S3 console you can choose the export report option when you create a filter. When selecting data export you specify a destination bucket and optional destination prefix where the file is written. You can export the data to a destination bucket in a different account. The destination bucket must be in the same region as the bucket that you configure to be analyzed.
You must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to verify what AWS account owns the bucket and to write objects to the bucket in the defined location. For an example policy, see Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Amazon S3 Analytics.
After you configure storage class analysis reports, you start getting the exported report daily after 24 hours. After that, Amazon S3 continues monitoring and providing daily exports. 
You can open the CSV file in a spreadsheet application or import the file into other applications like Amazon QuickSight. For information on using Amazon S3 files with Amazon QuickSight, see  Create a Data Set Using Amazon S3 Files in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide. 
Data in the exported file is sorted by date within object age group as shown in following examples. If the storage class is STANDARD the row also contains data for the columns ObjectAgeForSIATransition and RecommendedObjectAgeForSIATransition.


At the end of the report the object age group is given as ALL. The ALL rows contain cumulative totals, including objects smaller than 128 KB, for all the age groups for that day.

The next section describes the columns used in the report.
