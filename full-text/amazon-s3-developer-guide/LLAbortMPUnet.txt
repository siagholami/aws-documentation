Stop multipart uploads to an S3 Bucket using the AWS SDK for .NET (low-level)
You can stop an in-progress multipart upload by calling the AmazonS3Client.AbortMultipartUploadAsync method. In addition to stopping the upload, this method deletes all parts that were uploaded to Amazon S3. 
To stop a multipart upload, you provide the upload ID, and the bucket and key names that are used in the upload. After you have stopped a multipart upload, you can't use the upload ID to upload additional parts. For more information about Amazon S3 multipart uploads, see Multipart upload overview.
The following C# example shows how to stop a multipart upload. For a complete C# sample that includes the following code, see Upload a file to an S3 Bucket using the AWS SDK for .NET (low-level API).
AbortMultipartUploadRequest abortMPURequest = new AbortMultipartUploadRequest
{
    BucketName = existingBucketName,
    Key = keyName,
    UploadId = initResponse.UploadId
};
await AmazonS3Client.AbortMultipartUploadAsync(abortMPURequest);
You can also stop all in-progress multipart uploads that were initiated prior to a specific time. This clean-up operation is useful for stopping multipart uploads that didn't complete or were stopped. For more information, see Stop multipart uploads to an S3 Bucket using the AWS SDK for .NET (high-level API).
