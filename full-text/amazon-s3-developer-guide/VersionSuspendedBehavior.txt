 Deleting objects from versioning-suspended buckets
You suspend versioning to stop accruing new versions of the same object in a bucket. You might do this because you only want a single version of an object in a bucket, or you might not want to accrue charges for multiple versions. 
When you suspend versioning, existing objects in your bucket do not change. What changes is how Amazon S3 handles objects in future requests. The topics in this section explain various object operations in a versioning-suspended bucket.
