Using the AWS SDK for .NET for multipart upload (low-level API)
The AWS SDK for .NET exposes a low-level API that closely resembles the Amazon S3 REST API for multipart upload (see Using the REST API for multipart upload ). Use the low-level API when you need to pause and resume multipart uploads, vary part sizes during the upload, or when you do not know the size of the data in advance. Use the high-level API (see Using the AWS SDK for .NET for multipart upload (high-level API)), whenever you don't have these requirements.
