Copy an Amazon S3 Object in a Single Operation Using the AWS SDK for .NET
The following C# example shows how to use the high-level AWS SDK for .NET to copy objects that are as big as 5 GB in a single operation. For objects that are bigger than 5 GB, use the multipart upload copy example described in Copy an Amazon S3 object using the AWS SDK for .NET multipart upload API.
This example makes a copy of an object that is a maximum of 5 GB. For information about the example's compatibility with a specific version of the AWS SDK for .NET and instructions on how to create and test a working sample, see Running the Amazon S3 .NET Code Examples.
