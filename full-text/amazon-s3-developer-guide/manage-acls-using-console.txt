AWS Management Console provides a UI for you to grant ACL-based access permissions to your buckets and objects. For information on setting ACL-based access permissions in the console, see How Do I Set ACL Bucket Permissions? and How Do I Set Permissions on an Object? in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide.
