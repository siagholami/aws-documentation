Restore an Archived Object Using the Amazon S3 Console
You can use the Amazon S3 console to restore a copy of an object that has been archived to Amazon S3 Glacier. For instructions on how to restore an archive using the AWS Management Console, see  How Do I Restore an S3 Object that has been Archived to Amazon S3 Glacier? in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide.
When you restore an archive, you are paying for both the archive and a copy you restored temporarily. For information about pricing, see Amazon S3 Pricing.
