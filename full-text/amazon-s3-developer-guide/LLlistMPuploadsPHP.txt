List multipart uploads using the low-level AWS SDK for PHP API
This topic shows how to use the low-level API classes from version 3 of the AWS SDK for PHP to list all in-progress multipart uploads on a bucket. It assumes that you are already following the instructions for Using the AWS SDK for PHP and Running PHP Examples and have the AWS SDK for PHP properly installed. 
The following PHP example demonstrates listing all in-progress multipart uploads on a bucket.
```
 require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Aws\S3\S3Client;
$bucket = ' Your Bucket Name ';
$s3 = new S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-east-1'
]);
// Retrieve a list of the current multipart uploads.
$result = $s3->listMultipartUploads([
    'Bucket' => $bucket
]);
// Write the list of uploads to the page.
print_r($result->toArray());
```
