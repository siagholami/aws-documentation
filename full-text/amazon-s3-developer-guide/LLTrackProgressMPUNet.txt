Track the progress of a multipart upload to an S3 Bucket using the AWS SDK for .NET (low-level)
To track the progress of a multipart upload, use the UploadPartRequest.StreamTransferProgress event provided by the AWS SDK for .NET low-level multipart upload API. The event occurs periodically. It returns information such as the total number of bytes to transfer and the number of bytes transferred. 
The following C# example shows how to track the progress of multipart uploads. For a complete C# sample that includes the following code, see Upload a file to an S3 Bucket using the AWS SDK for .NET (low-level API).
```
UploadPartRequest uploadRequest = new UploadPartRequest
{
// Provide the request data.
};
uploadRequest.StreamTransferProgress = 
     new EventHandler(UploadPartProgressEventCallback);
...
public static void UploadPartProgressEventCallback(object sender, StreamTransferProgressArgs e)
{
    // Process the event. 
    Console.WriteLine("{0}/{1}", e.TransferredBytes, e.TotalBytes);
}
```
