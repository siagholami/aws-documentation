Paying for products
Your AWS Marketplace purchases are displayed in the currency you specified for your AWS account. You can change your preferred currency for your AWS account in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. For instructions, see Changing which currency you use to pay your bill in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
Note
 Changing your preferred currency changes your remittance instructions. To view updated remittance instructions, see your AWS Marketplace invoice or view the Account Settings page in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console.
At the beginning of the month, you receive a bill from Amazon Web Services (AWS) for your AWS Marketplace charges. For software products, the bill includes a calculation of the hourly fee for the software multiplied by the number of hours any Amazon Machine Image (AMI) instance with this software runs. You also receive a bill for usage of AWS infrastructure services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), and bandwidth. 
AWS Marketplace products using complex topologies may incur charges for clusters of AMIs and other AWS infrastructure services launched by the provided AWS CloudFormation template. 
For example, suppose that you run software for 720 hours on an EC2 small instance type. The seller's fee for software usage is $0.12/hr and the EC2 charges are $0.085/hr. At the end of the month, you are billed $147.60.
