Controlling access to AWS Marketplace subscriptions
The recommended way to let other people in your organization manage subscriptions is to use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create users and groups. For example, if John should be allowed only to view your subscriptions, you can create an IAM user for him and add his IAM user to the read-only group. If John's role in your organization changes or he leaves the company, you can change the group that his IAM user belongs to, or you can change his user's settings in IAM. 
Important
All of your users work on the same AWS Marketplace account. Any change that a user makes to manage a software subscription is global and applies to all of your users for that subscription. 
Creating users
To allow people in your company manage subscriptions, we recommend that you create an IAM user for each person. For more information, see IAM Users in the IAM User Guide. We also recommend you create a user name and password for yourself, even though you are the AWS account owner. It is a recommended best practice for everyone to work in AWS Marketplace as an IAM user, even the account owner. To learn how to create an IAM user for yourself that has administrative permissions, see Creating Your First IAM Admin User and Group. For more information on recommended practices for using IAM, see IAM Best Practices. 
Creating groups for AWS Marketplace access and adding users to the groups
To create groups for assigning AWS Marketplace permissions


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Groups and then choose Create New Group. 


For Group Name, enter a name for the group, such as MarketplaceReadOnly or MarketplaceFullAccess, and choose Next Step.


On the Attach Policy page, select the box next to one of the following policies: 
    To allow permissions only to view subscriptions (but not change them), choose AWS MarketplaceRead-only
    To allow permissions to subscribe and unsubscribe, choose AWSMarketplaceManageSubscriptions
    To allow complete control of your subscriptions, choose AWSMarketplaceFullAccess


Choose Next Step and then choose Create Group.


To add users to the groups you just created


In the list of groups, choose the name of the group. 


Under Users, choose Add Users to Group. 


Select the users to add to the group and then choose Add Users.


Repeat the preceding steps to create more groups with different permissions and assign users to those groups.
You're not limited to the permissions in the AWS managed policies that are described here. You can use IAM to create policies with custom permissions and then add those policies to IAM groups. For more information, see Managing IAM Policies and Attaching a Policy to an IAM Group in the IAM User Guide. 
AWS managed policies for AWS Marketplace
After creating users, we recommend that you create groups and apply AWS managed policies to provide basic AWS Marketplace permissions. Then, for any unique scenarios, you can create your own polices and apply them to the groups with the specific requirements for your scenario. The following basic AWS Marketplace managed policies are available to you to control who has which permissions:
 AWSMarketplaceRead-only
 AWSMarketplaceManageSubscriptions
 AWSPrivateMarketplaceRequests
 AWSPrivateMarketplaceAdminFullAccess
 AWSMarketplaceFullAccess
For more information on these policies, their permissions, and other IAM managed policies, sign into the https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/, choose Policies, and search for Marketplace.
