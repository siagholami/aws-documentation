Tutorial: Set AWS Systems Manager Automation as an EventBridge Target
You can use EventBridge to invoke AWS Systems Manager Automation on a regular timed schedule or when specified events are detected. This tutorial assumes that you're invoking Systems Manager Automation based on certain events.
To create the EventBridge rule


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rules.


Choose Create rule.


Enter a name and description for the rule.


For Define pattern, do the following:


Choose Event pattern


Choose Pre-defined pattern by service.


For Service provider, choose AWS.


For Service Name and Event type, choose the service and event type to use as the trigger. Depending on the service and event type that you choose, you might need to specify additional options.


For Select event bus, choose AWS default event bus. When an AWS service in your account emits an event, it always goes to your accountâ€™s default event bus. 


For Target, choose SSM Automation. 


For Document, choose the Systems Manager document to run when the target is triggered.


(Optional) To specify a certain version of the document, choose Configure document version.


Under Configure automation parameter(s), choose No Parameter(s) or Constant.


If you choose Constant, specify the constants to pass to the document execution.


EventBridge can create the IAM role needed for your event to run: 
    To create an IAM role automatically, choose Create a new role for this specific resource
    To use an IAM role that you created before, choose Use existing role


Choose Create.
