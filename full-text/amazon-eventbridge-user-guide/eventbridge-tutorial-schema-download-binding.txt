Tutorial: Download Code Bindings for Events using the EventBridge Schema Registry
You can generate code bindings for event schemas to speed development for Java, Python, and TypeScript. You can get code bindings for existing AWS services, schemas you create, and for schemas you generate based on events on an event bus. You can generate code bindings for a schema using the EventBridge console, the EventBridge Schema Registry API, and directly in your IDE with the AWS Toolkit.
In this tutorial you will generate and download code bindings from an EventBridge Schema for the events of an AWS service.
To generate code bindings from an EventBridge schema


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Schemas.


Select the AWS event schema registry tab.


Find a schema for an AWS service that you would like code bindings for, either by browsing through the schema registry, or by searching for a schema.


Select the schema name to display the Schema details page.


In the Version section, select Download code bindings.


On the Download code bindings page, select the language of the code bindings you want to download.


Select Download.


It may take a few seconds for your download to begin. The download file will be a zip file of code bindings for the language you selected.
Use these code bindings in your own code to help quickly build applications using this EventBridge event.
