Tutorial: Schedule Automated Builds Using AWS CodeBuild
In the example in this tutorial, you schedule CodeBuild to run a build every week night at 20:00 GMT. You also pass a constant to CodeBuild to be used for this scheduled build.
To create a rule scheduling a CodeBuild project build nightly at 20:00 GMT


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rules.


Choose Create rule.


Enter a name and description for the rule.


For Define pattern, do the following:


Choose Schedule.


Choose Cron expression and specify the following as the expression: 0 20 ? * MON-FRI *. (for example, 5 minutes).


For Select event bus, choose AWS default event bus. When an AWS service in your account emits an event, it always goes to your accountâ€™s default event bus. 


For Targets, choose CodeBuild project.


For Project ARN, enter the ARN of the build project.


In this tutorial, we add the optional step of passing a parameter to CodeBuild, to override the default. This isn't required when you set CodeBuild as the target. To pass the parameter, choose Configure input, Constant (JSON text).


In the box under Constant (JSON text), enter the following to set the timeout override to 30 minutes for these scheduled builds: { "timeoutInMinutesOverride": 30 }.
For more information about the parameters that you can pass, see StartBuild in the AWS CodeBuild API Reference. You can't pass the projectName parameter in this field. Instead, specify the project using the ARN in Project ARN.


EventBridge can create the IAM role needed for your build project to run: 
    To create an IAM role automatically, choose Create a new role for this specific resource.
    To use an IAM role that you created before, choose Use existing role. This must be a role that already has sufficient permissions to invoke the build. EventBridge doesn't grant additional permissions to the role that you select.


Choose Create.
