Tutorial: Log the State of an Auto Scaling Group Using EventBridge
You can run an AWS Lambda function that logs an event whenever an Auto Scaling group launches or terminates an Amazon EC2 instance and whether the launch or terminate event was successful.
For information about additional EventBridge scenarios using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling events, see Getting CloudWatch Events When Your Auto Scaling Group Scales in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
Step 1: Create an AWS Lambda Function
Create a Lambda function to log the scale-out and scale-in events for your Auto Scaling group. Specify this function when you create your rule.
To create a Lambda function


Open the AWS Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.


If you're new to Lambda, you see a welcome page. Choose Get Started Now. Otherwise, choose Create a Lambda function.


On the Select blueprint page, enter hello for the filter and choose the hello-world blueprint.


On the Configure triggers page, choose Next.


On the Configure function page, do the following:


Enter a name and description for the Lambda function. For example, name the function LogAutoScalingEvent.


Edit the sample code for the Lambda function. For example:
```
  'use strict';
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
      console.log('LogAutoScalingEvent');
      console.log('Received event:', JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));
      callback(null, 'Finished');
  };
  ```


For Role, choose Choose an existing role. For Existing role, select your basic execution role. Otherwise, create a basic execution role.


Choose Next.


Choose Create function.


Step 2: Create a Rule
Create a rule to run your Lambda function whenever your Auto Scaling group launches or terminates an instance.
To create a rule


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rules.


Choose Create rule.


Enter a name and description for the rule.


For Define pattern, do the following:


Choose Event Pattern.


Choose Pre-defined by service.


For Service provider, choose AWS.


For Service Name, choose Auto Scaling.


For Event type, choose Instance Launch and Terminate.


To capture all successful and unsuccessful instance launch and terminate events, choose Any instance event.


By default, the rule matches any Auto Scaling group in the Region. To make the rule match a specific group, choose Specific group name(s) and select one or more groups.


By default, the rule matches any Auto Scaling group in the Region. To make the rule match a specific Auto Scaling group, choose Specific group name(s) and select one or more Auto Scaling groups.


For Select event bus, choose AWS default event bus. When an AWS service in your account emits an event, it always goes to your accountâ€™s default event bus. 


For Target, choose Lambda function.


For Function, select the Lambda function that you created.


Choose Create.


Step 3: Test the Rule
You can test your rule by manually scaling an Auto Scaling group so that it launches an instance. After waiting a few minutes for the scale-out event to occur, verify that your Lambda function was invoked.
To test your rule using an Auto Scaling group


To increase the size of your Auto Scaling group, do the following:


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Auto Scaling, Auto Scaling Groups.


Select the check box for your Auto Scaling group.


On the Details tab, choose Edit. For Desired, increase the desired capacity by one. For example, if the current value is 2, enter 3. The desired capacity must be less than or equal to the maximum size of the group. If your new value for Desired is greater than Max, you must update Max. When you're finished, choose Save.


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rules, choose the name of the rule that you created, and choose Metrics for the rule.


To view the output from your Lambda function, do the following:


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Logs.


Select the name of the log group for your Lambda function (/aws/lambda/function-name).


Select the name of the log stream to view the data provided by the function for the instance that you launched.


(Optional) When you're finished, you can decrease the desired capacity by one so that the Auto Scaling group returns to its previous size.
