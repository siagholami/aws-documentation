Tutorial: Run an Amazon ECS Task When a File Is Uploaded to an Amazon S3 Bucket
You can use EventBridge to run Amazon ECS tasks when certain AWS events occur. In this tutorial, you set up a EventBridge rule that runs an Amazon ECS task whenever a file is uploaded to a certain Amazon S3 bucket using the Amazon S3 PUT operation.
This tutorial assumes that you have already created the task definition in Amazon ECS.
To run an Amazon ECS task whenever a file is uploaded to an S3 bucket using the PUT operation


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rules.


Choose Create rule.


Enter a name and description for the rule.


For Define pattern, do the following:


Choose Event pattern.


Choose Pre-defined pattern by service.


For Service provider, choose AWS.


For Service Name, choose Simple Storage Service (S3).


For Event type, choose Object Level Operations.


Choose Specific operation(s), Put Object.


Choose Specific bucket(s) by name and enter the name of the bucket.


For Select event bus, choose AWS default event bus. When an AWS service in your account emits an event, it always goes to your accountâ€™s default event bus. 


For Targets, do the following:


Choose ECS task.


For Cluster and Task Definition, select the resources that you created.


For Launch Type, choose FARGATE or EC2. FARGATE is shown only in Regions where AWS Fargate is supported.


(Optional) Specify a value for Task Group. If the Launch Type is FARGATE, optionally specify a Platform Version. Specify only the numeric portion of the platform version, such as 1.1.0.


(Optional) Specify a task definition revision and task count. If you don't specify a task definition revision, the latest is used.


If your task definition uses the awsvpc network mode, you must specify subnets and security groups. All subnets and security groups must be in the same VPC.
If you specify more than one security group or subnet, separate them with commas but not spaces.
For Subnets, specify the entire subnet-id value for each subnet, as in the following example.
subnet-123abcd,subnet-789abcd


Choose whether to allow the public IP address to be auto-assigned.


EventBridge can create the IAM role needed for your task to run: 

To create an IAM role automatically, choose Create a new role for this specific resource.
To use an IAM role that you created before, choose Use existing role. This must be a role that already has sufficient permissions to invoke the build. EventBridge doesn't grant additional permissions to the role that you select.



Choose Create.
