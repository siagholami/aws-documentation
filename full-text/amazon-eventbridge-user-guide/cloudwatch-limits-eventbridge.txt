Event buses - other quotas
There is no restriction on the rate of events that can be received from AWS services or other AWS accounts. If you send custom events to your event bus using the PutEvents API, the PutEvents API quotas apply. Any events that are sent on to the targets of the rules in your account count against your invocations quota.  The policy size of an event bus is limited to 10240 characters. This policy size increases each time you grant access to another account. You can see your current policy and its size by using the DescribeEventBus API. You can request a quota increase. For instructions, see AWS Service Quotas.


Event pattern
2048 characters maximum.


Invocations
An invocation is an event matching a rule and being sent on to the rule’s targets. Quotas vary by region. See Invocation Quotas by Region. You can request a quota increase. For instructions, see AWS Service Quotas.

An invocation is an event matching a rule and being sent on to the rule’s targets. If the invocation of a target fails due to a problem with the target service, account throttling, etc., new attempts are made for up to 24 hours for a specific invocation.
If you are receiving events from another account, each of those events that matches a rule in your account and is sent on to the rule’s targets counts against your account’s quota of invocations per second.
After your reach the one of the following invocation quotas in your region invocations are throttled. They still happen but they are delayed.
