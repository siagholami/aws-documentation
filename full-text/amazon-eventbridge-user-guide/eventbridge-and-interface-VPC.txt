Using EventBridge with Interface VPC Endpoints
If you use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to host your AWS resources, you can establish a private connection between your VPC and EventBridge. You can use this connection to enable EventBridge to communicate with your resources on your VPC without going through the public internet.
Amazon VPC is an AWS service that you can use to launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. With a VPC, you have control over your network settings, such the IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways. To connect your VPC to EventBridge, you define an interface VPC endpoint for EventBridge. This type of endpoint enables you to connect your VPC to AWS services. The endpoint provides reliable, scalable connectivity to EventBridge without requiring an internet gateway, network address translation (NAT) instance, or VPN connection. For more information, see What is Amazon VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, an AWS technology that enables private communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IP addresses. For more information, see New – AWS PrivateLink for AWS Services.
The following steps are for users of Amazon VPC. For more information, see Getting Started in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

Create a VPC Endpoint for EventBridge
To start using EventBridge with your VPC, create an interface VPC endpoint for EventBridge. The service name to choose is com.amazonaws.Region.events. For more information, see Creating an Interface Endpoint in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
You do not need to change the settings for EventBridge. EventBridge calls other AWS services using either public endpoints or private interface VPC endpoints, whichever are in use. For example, if you create an interface VPC endpoint for EventBridge, and you already have a EventBridge rule that sends notifications to Amazon SNS when it is triggered, the notifications begin to flow through the interface VPC endpoint.
