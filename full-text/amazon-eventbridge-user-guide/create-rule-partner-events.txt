Creating a Rule That Triggers on an SaaS Partner Event
Before you can create rules for events from SaaS partner applications and services, you must create a partner event bus and match it to that partner event source. For more information, see Receiving Events from an SaaS Partner.
To create a rule that triggers on an event from an SaaS partner


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rules.


Choose Create rule.


Enter a name and description for the rule.


For Define pattern, choose Event pattern.


Choose Pre-defined pattern by service.


For Service provider, choose Service partners.


For Service name, choose the name of the partner.


For Event type, choose All Events or choose the type of event to use for this rule. If you choose All Events, all events emitted by this partner event source will match the rule.


If you want to customize the event pattern, choose Edit, make your changes, and choose Save.


For Service event bus, confirm that the event bus that corresponds to this partner is selected.


For Select targets, choose the AWS service that is to act when an event of the selected type is detected.


In the other fields in this section, enter information specific to this target type, if any is needed. 


For many target types, EventBridge needs permissions to send events to the target. In these cases, EventBridge can create the IAM role needed for your rule to run: 
    To create an IAM role automatically, choose Create a new role for this specific resource
    To use an IAM role that you created before, choose Use existing role


(Optional) Choose Add target to add another target for this rule.


(Optional) Enter one or more tags for the rule. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon EventBridge Resources.


Choose Create.
