Limitations
 The targets you associate with a rule must be in the same Region as the rule.
 Some target types might not be available in every Region. For more information, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
 Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console.
 If you create a rule with an encrypted Amazon SQS queue as a target, you must have the following section included in your AWS Key Management Service key policy. It allows the event to be successfully delivered to the encrypted queue.
{
                  "Sid": "Allow CWE to use the key",
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Principal": {
                                  "Service": "events.amazonaws.com"
                  },
                  "Action": [
                                  "kms:Decrypt",
                                  "kms:GenerateDataKey"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "*"
