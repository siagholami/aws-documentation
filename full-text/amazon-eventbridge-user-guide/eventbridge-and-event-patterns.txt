Events and Event Patterns in EventBridge
Events in Amazon EventBridge are represented as JSON objects. All events have a similar structure, and the same top-level fields.
EventBridge rules use event patterns to match on AWS events on an event bus. When a pattern matches, the rule routes that event to a target.
