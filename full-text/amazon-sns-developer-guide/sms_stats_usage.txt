Viewing daily SMS usage reports
You can monitor your SMS deliveries by subscribing to daily usage reports from Amazon SNS. For each day that you send at least one SMS message, Amazon SNS delivers a usage report as a CSV file to the specified Amazon S3 bucket. It takes 24 hours for the SMS usage report to be available in the S3 bucket.

Subscribing to daily usage reports
To subscribe to daily usage reports, you must create an Amazon S3 bucket with the appropriate permissions.
To create an Amazon S3 bucket for your daily usage reports


Sign in to the Amazon S3 console.


Choose Create Bucket.


For Bucket Name, we recommend that you enter a name that is unique for your account and your organization. For example, use the pattern <my-bucket-prefix>-<account_id>-<org-id>. 


For information about conventions and restrictions for bucket names, see Rules for Bucket Naming in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.


Choose Create.


In the All Buckets table, choose the bucket and choose Properties.


In the Permissions section, choose Add bucket policy.


In the Bucket Policy Editor window, provide a policy that allows the Amazon SNS service principal to write to your bucket. For an example, see Example bucket policy.


If you use the example policy, remember to replace my-s3-bucket with the bucket name that you chose in Step 3.

Choose Save.

To subscribe to daily usage reports


Sign in to the Amazon SNS console.


On the navigation panel, choose Text messaging (SMS).


On the Text messaging (SMS) page, in the Text messaging preferences section, choose Edit.



On the Edit text messaging preferences page, in the Details section, specify the Amazon S3 bucket name for usage reports.



Choose Save changes.


Example bucket policy
The following policy allows the Amazon SNS service principal to perform the s3:PutObject and s3:GetBucketLocation actions. You can use this example when you create an Amazon S3 bucket to receive daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS.
{
  "Statement": [{
    "Sid": "AllowPutObject",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Service": "sns.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": "s3:PutObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-bucket/*"
  }, {
    "Sid": "AllowGetBucketLocation",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Service": "sns.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": "s3:GetBucketLocation",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-bucket"
  }]
}
Example daily usage report
After you subscribe to daily usage reports, each day, Amazon SNS puts a CSV file with usage data in the following location:
<my-s3-bucket>/SMSUsageReports/<region>/YYYY/MM/DD/00x.csv.gz
Each file can contain up to 50,000 records. If the records for a day exceed this quota, Amazon SNS will add multiple files.
The following shows an example report:
