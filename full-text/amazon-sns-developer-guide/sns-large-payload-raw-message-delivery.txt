Raw message delivery
To avoid having Amazon SQS and HTTP/S endpoints process the JSON formatting of messages, Amazon SNS allows raw message delivery:
 When you enable raw message delivery for an Amazon SQS endpoint, any Amazon SNS metadata is stripped from the published message and the message is sent as is.
 When you enable raw message delivery for HTTP/S endpoints, the HTTP header x-amz-sns-rawdelivery with its value set to true is added to the message, indicating that the message has been published without JSON formatting.
To enable raw message delivery using an AWS SDK, you must use the SetSubscriptionAttribute API action and set the value of the RawMessageDelivery attribute to true.
