Subscribing AWS Event Fork Pipelines to an Amazon SNS topic
To accelerate the development of your event-driven applications, you can subscribe event-handling pipelines—powered by AWS Event Fork Pipelines—to Amazon SNS topics. AWS Event Fork Pipelines is a suite of open-source nested applications, based on the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), which you can deploy directly from the AWS Event Fork Pipelines suite (choose Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies) into your AWS account. For more information, see How AWS Event Fork Pipelines works.
The following tutorials show how you can use the AWS Management Console to deploy a pipeline and then subscribe AWS Event Fork Pipelines to an Amazon SNS topic. Before you begin, create an Amazon SNS topic.
To delete the resources that comprise a pipeline, find the pipeline on the Applications page of on the AWS Lambda console, expand the SAM template section, choose CloudFormation stack, and then choose Other Actions, Delete Stack.
