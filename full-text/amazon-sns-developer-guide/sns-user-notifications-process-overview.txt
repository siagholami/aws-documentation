User notification process overview


Obtain the credentials and device token for the mobile platforms that you want to support.


Use the credentials to create a platform application object (PlatformApplicationArn) using Amazon SNS. For more information, see Create a platform endpoint and manage device tokens.


Use the returned credentials to request a device token for your mobile app and device from the mobile platforms. The token you receive represents your mobile app and device.

Use the EndpointArn to publish a message to an app on a mobile device. For more information, see Send a direct message to a mobile device and the Publish API in the Amazon Simple Notification Service API Reference.
