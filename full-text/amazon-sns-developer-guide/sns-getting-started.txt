Getting started with Amazon SNS
This section helps you become more familiar with Amazon SNS by showing you how to manage topics, subscriptions, and messages using the AWS Management Console.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, complete the steps in Setting up access for Amazon SNS.
Step 1: Create a topic


Sign in to the Amazon SNS console.


In the Create topic section, enter a Topic name, for example MyTopic.


Choose Create topic.


The topic is created and the MyTopic page is displayed.
The topic's Name, ARN, (optional) Display name, and Topic owner's AWS account ID are displayed in the Details section.

Copy the topic ARN to the clipboard, for example:

arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:MyTopic
Step 2: Create a subscription for an endpoint to the topic


On the navigation panel, choose Subscriptions.


On the Subscriptions page, choose Create subscription.


On the Create subscription page, do the following:


Enter the Topic ARN of the topic you created earlier, for example:
arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:MyTopic
Note
To see a list of the topics in the current AWS account, choose the Topic ARN field.


For Protocol, choose an endpoint type, for example Email.


For Endpoint, enter an email address that can receive notifications, for example:
name@example.com
Note
After your subscription is created, you must confirm it. Only HTTP/S endpoints, email addresses, and AWS resources in other AWS accounts require confirmation. (Amazon SQS queues and Lambda functions in the same AWS account—as well as mobile endpoints —don't require confirmation.)


Choose Create subscription.
The subscription is created and the Subscription: 1234a567-bc89-012d-3e45-6fg7h890123i page is displayed.
The subscription's ARN, Endpoint, Topic, Status (Pending confirmation at this stage), and Protocol are displayed in the Details section.


In your email client, check the email address that you specified and choose Confirm subscription in the email from Amazon SNS.


In your web browser, a subscription confirmation with your subscription ID is displayed.


Step 3: Publish a message to the topic


On the navigation panel, choose Topics.


On the Topics page, choose the topic you created earlier and then choose Publish message.


On the Publish message to topic page, do the following:


(Optional) In the Message details section, enter the Subject, for example:
Hello from Amazon SNS!


In the Message body section, do one of the following:


Choose Identical payload for all delivery protocols and then enter the message, for example:
Publishing a message to an Amazon SNS topic.
       Choose Custom payload for each delivery protocol and then use a JSON object to define the message to send to each protocol, for example:
{
  "default": "Sample fallback message",
  "email": "Sample message for email endpoints",
  "sqs": "Sample message for Amazon SQS endpoints",
  "lambda": "Sample message for AWS Lambda endpoints",
  "http": "Sample message for HTTP endpoints",
  "https": "Sample message for HTTPS endpoints",
  "sms": "Sample message for SMS endpoints",
  "APNS": "{\"aps\":{\"alert\": \"Sample message for iOS endpoints\"} }",
  "APNS_SANDBOX": "{\"aps\":{\"alert\":\"Sample message for iOS development endpoints\"}}",
  "APNS_VOIP": "{\"aps\":{\"alert\":\"Sample message for Apple VoIP endpoints\"}}",
  "APNS_VOIP_SANDBOX": "{\"aps\":{\"alert\": \"Sample message for Apple VoIP development endpoints\"} }",
  "MACOS": "{\"aps\":{\"alert\":\"Sample message for MacOS endpoints\"}}",
  "MACOS_SANDBOX": "{\"aps\":{\"alert\": \"Sample message for MacOS development endpoints\"} }",
  "GCM": "{ \"data\": { \"message\": \"Sample message for Android endpoints\" } }",
  "ADM": "{ \"data\": { \"message\": \"Sample message for FireOS endpoints\" } }",
  "BAIDU": "{\"title\":\"Sample message title\",\"description\":\"Sample message for Baidu endpoints\"}",
  "MPNS": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><wp:Notification xmlns:wp=\"WPNotification\"><wp:Tile><wp:Count>ENTER COUNT</wp:Count><wp:Title>Sample message for Windows Phone 7 endpoints</wp:Title></wp:Tile></wp:Notification>",
  "WNS": "<badge version=\"1\" value=\"42\"/>"
}
For more information, see Send custom platform-specific payloads to mobile devices.




In the Message attributes section, add any attributes that you want Amazon SNS to match with the subscription attribute FilterPolicy to decide whether the subscribed endpoint is interested in the published message.


Select an attribute Type, for example String.Array.
Note
If the attribute type is String.Array, enclose the array in square brackets ([]). Within the array, enclose string values in double quotation marks. You don't need quotation marks for numbers or for the keywords true, false, and null.


Enter a Name for the attribute, for example customer_interests.


Enter a Value for the attribute, for example ["soccer", "rugby", "hockey"].


If the attribute type is String, String.Array, or Number, Amazon SNS evaluates the message attribute against a subscription's filter policy (if present) before sending the message to the subscription.
For more information, see Amazon SNS message attributes.


Choose Publish message.
The message is published to the topic and the MyTopic page is displayed.
The topic's Name, ARN, (optional) Display name, and Topic owner's AWS account ID are displayed in the Details section.


In your email client, check the email address that you specified earlier and read the email from Amazon SNS.


Step 4: Delete the subscription and topic


On the navigation panel, choose Subscriptions.


On the Subscriptions page, choose a confirmed subscription and then choose Delete.
Note
You can't delete a pending confirmation. After 3 days, Amazon SNS deletes it automatically.


In the Delete subscription dialog box, choose Delete.


The subscription is deleted.


On the navigation panel, choose Topics.


On the Topics page, choose a topic and then choose Delete.
Important
When you delete a topic, you also delete all subscriptions to the topic.


On the Delete topic MyTopic dialog box, enter delete me and then choose Delete.


The topic is deleted.
