Allowing Amazon CloudFront to access your AWS Elemental MediaStore container
You can use Amazon CloudFront to serve the content that you store in a container in AWS Elemental MediaStore. To get started, you attach a policy to your container that grants read access or greater to CloudFront. 
To allow CloudFront to access your container (console)


Open the MediaStore console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/.


On the Containers page, choose the container name.


The container details page appears.


In the Container policy section, attach a policy that grants read access or greater to Amazon CloudFront.
Note
The example policy for Public Read Access over HTTPS matches these requirements because it allows GetObject and DescribeObject commands from anyone who submits requests to your domain through HTTPS.


In the Container CORS policy section, assign a policy that allows the appropriate access level. 
Note
A CORS policy is necessary only if you want to provide access to a browser-based player.


Make note of the following details:
    The data endpoint that is assigned to your container. You can find this information in the Info section of the Containers page. In CloudFront, the data endpoint is referred to as the origin domain name.
    The folder structure in the container where the objects are stored. In CloudFront, this is referred to as the origin path. Note that this setting is optional. For more information about origin paths, see the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.


In CloudFront, create a distribution that is configured to serve content from AWS Elemental MediaStore. You will need the information that you collected in the preceding step.
