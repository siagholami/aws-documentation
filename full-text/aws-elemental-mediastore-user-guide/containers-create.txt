Creating a container
You can create up to 100 containers for each AWS account. You can create as many folders as you want, as long as they are not nested more than 10 levels within a container. In addition, you can upload as many objects as you want to each container.
Tip
You can also create a container automatically by using an AWS CloudFormation template. The AWS CloudFormation template manages data for five API actions: creating a container, setting access logging, updating the default container policy, adding a cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy, and adding an object lifecycle policy. For more information, see the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
To create a container (console)


Open the MediaStore console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/.


On the Containers page, choose Create container.


For Container name, enter a name for the container. For more information, see Rules for container names.


Choose Create container. AWS Elemental MediaStore adds the new container to a list of containers. Initially, the status of the container is Creating, and then it changes to Active.


To create a container (AWS CLI)
 In the AWS CLI, use the create-container command:
aws mediastore create-container --container-name ExampleContainer --region us-west-2
The following example shows the return value:
{
      "Container": {
          "AccessLoggingEnabled": false,
          "CreationTime": 1563557265.0,
          "Name": "ExampleContainer",
          "Status": "CREATING",
          "ARN": "arn:aws:mediastore:us-west-2:111122223333:container/ExampleContainer"
      }
  }
