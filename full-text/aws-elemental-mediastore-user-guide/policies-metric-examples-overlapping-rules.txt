Example metric policy: Path-level metrics with overlapping rules
This example policy indicates that AWS Elemental MediaStore should send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch at the container level. In addition, MediaStore should send metrics for two folders: sports/football/saturday and sports/football. 
The metrics for MediaStore requests to the sports/football/saturday folder have a CloudWatch dimension of ObjectGroupName=footballGroup1. Because objects that are stored in the sports/football folder match both rules, CloudWatch displays two data points for these objects: one with a dimension of ObjectGroupName=footballGroup1 and the second with a dimension of ObjectGroupName=footballGroup2.
