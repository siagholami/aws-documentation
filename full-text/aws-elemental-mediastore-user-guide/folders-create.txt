Creating a folder
You can create folders when you upload objects. To upload an object to a folder, you specify the path to the folder. If the folder already exists, AWS Elemental MediaStore stores the object in the folder. If the folder doesnâ€™t exist, the service creates it, and then stores the object in the folder.
