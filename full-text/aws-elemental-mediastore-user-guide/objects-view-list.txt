Viewing a list of objects
You can use the AWS Elemental MediaStore console to view items (objects and folders) stored in the top-most level of a container or in a folder. Items stored in a subfolder of the current container or folder will not be displayed. You can use the AWS CLI to view a list of objects and folders within a container, regardless of how many folders or subfolders are within the container.
To view a list of objects in a specific container (console)


Open the MediaStore console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/.


On the Containers page, choose the name of the container that has the folder that you want to view. 


Choose the name of the folder from the list.


A details page appears, showing all folders and objects that are stored in the folder.

To view a list of objects and folders in a specific container (AWS CLI)
 In the AWS CLI, use the list-items command:
aws mediastore-data list-items --endpoint https://aaabbbcccdddee.data.mediastore.us-west-2.amazonaws.com --region us-west-2
The following example shows the return value:
{
      "Items": [
          {
              "ContentType": "image/jpeg",
              "LastModified": 1563571859.379,
              "Name": "filename.jpg",
              "Type": "OBJECT",
              "ETag": "543ab21abcd1a234ab123456a1a2b12345ab12abc12a1234abc1a2bc12345a12",
              "ContentLength": 3784
          },
          {
              "Type": "FOLDER",
              "Name": "ExampleLiveDemo"
          }
      ]
  }

Objects that are subject to a seconds_since_create rule are not included in a list-items response.
To view a list of objects and folders in a specific folder (AWS CLI)
 In the AWS CLI, use the list-items command, with the specified folder name at the end of the request:
aws mediastore-data list-items --endpoint https://aaabbbcccdddee.data.mediastore.us-west-2.amazonaws.com --path /folder_name --region us-west-2
The following example shows the return value:
{
