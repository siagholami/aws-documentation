Editing a CORS policy
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain.
To edit a CORS policy (console)


Open the MediaStore console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/.


On the Containers page, choose the name of the container that you want to edit the CORS policy for.


The container details page appears. 


In the Container CORS policy section, choose Edit CORS policy.


Make your changes to the policy, and then choose Save.


To edit a CORS policy (AWS CLI)

Create a file that defines the updated CORS policy:

[
     {
       "AllowedHeaders": [
         "*"
       ],
       "AllowedMethods": [
         "GET",
         "HEAD"
       ],
       "AllowedOrigins": [
         "https://www.example.com"
       ],
       "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
     }
   ]

In the AWS CLI, use the put-cors-policy command.

aws mediastore put-cors-policy --container-name ExampleContainer --cors-policy file://corsPolicy2.json
This command has no return value.
