Metric policies in AWS Elemental MediaStore
For each container, you can add a metric policy to allow AWS Elemental MediaStore to send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. It takes up to 20 minutes for the new policy to take effect. For a description of each MediaStore metric, see MediaStore metrics.
A metric policy contains the following:
 A setting to enable or disable metrics at the container level.
 Anywhere from zero to five rules that enable metrics at the object level. If the policy contains rules, each rule must include both of the following:
   An object group that defines which objects to include in the group. The definition can be a path or a file name, but it can't have more than 900 characters. Valid characters are: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ (underscore), = (equal), : (colon), . (period), - (hyphen), \~ (tilde), / (forward slash), and * (asterisk). Wildcards (*) are acceptable.
   An object group name that allows you to refer to the object group. The name can't have more than 30 characters. Valid characters are: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _ (underscore).
If an object matches multiple rules, CloudWatch displays a data point for each matching rule. For example, if an object matches two rules named rule1 and rule2, CloudWatch displays two data points for these rules. The first has a dimension of ObjectGroupName=rule1 and the second has a dimension of ObjectGroupName=rule2.
