Setting up permissions for Amazon CloudWatch
Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create a role that gives AWS Elemental MediaStore access to Amazon CloudWatch. You must perform these steps for CloudWatch Logs to be published for your account. CloudWatch automatically publishes metrics for your account.
To allow MediaStore access to CloudWatch


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Policies, and then choose Create policy.


Choose the JSON tab and paste the following policy:


{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
                   "logs:CreateLogGroup"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "logs:CreateLogStream",
                   "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                   "logs:PutLogEvents"
               ],
               "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/mediastore/*"
           }
       ]
   }
This policy allows MediaStore to create log groups and log streams for any containers in any Region within your AWS account.


Choose Review policy.


On the Review policy page, for Name, enter MediaStoreAccessLogsPolicy, and then choose Create policy.


In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Roles, and then choose Create role.


Choose the Another AWS account role type.


For Account ID, enter your AWS account ID.


Choose Next: Permissions.


In the search box, enter MediaStoreAccessLogsPolicy.


Select the check box next to your new policy, and then choose Next: Tags.


Choose Next: Review to preview your new user.


For Role name, enter MediaStoreAccessLogs, and then choose Create role.


In the confirmation message, choose the name of the role that you just created (MediaStoreAccessLogs).


On the role's Summary page, choose the Trust relationships tab.


Choose Edit trust relationship.


In the policy document, change the principal to the MediaStore service. It should look like this:


"Principal": {
      "Service": "mediastore.amazonaws.com"
   },
The entire policy should read as follows:
{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "Service": "mediastore.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {}
       }
     ]
   }
