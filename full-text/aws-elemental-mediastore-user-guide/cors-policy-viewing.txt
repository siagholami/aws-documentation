Viewing a CORS policy
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain.
To view a CORS policy (console)


Open the MediaStore console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/.


On the Containers page, choose the name of the container that you want to view the CORS policy for.


The container details page appears, with the CORS policy in the Container CORS policy section.
To view a CORS policy (AWS CLI)
 In the AWS CLI, use the get-cors-policy command:
aws mediastore get-cors-policy --container-name ExampleContainer --region us-west-2
The following example shows the return value:
{
      "CorsPolicy": [
          {
              "AllowedMethods": [
                  "GET",
                  "HEAD"
              ],
              "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000,
              "AllowedOrigins": [
                  "*"
              ],
              "AllowedHeaders": [
                  "*"
              ]
          }
      ]
  }
