Example object lifecycle policy: Empty container
The following object lifecycle policy specifies that MediaStore deletes all objects in the container, including folders and subfolders, 1 day after they are added to the container. If the container holds any objects before this policy is applied, MediaStore deletes the objects 1 day after the policy becomes effective. It takes up to 20 minutes for the service to apply the new policy to the container.
