Example metric policy: Container-level metrics
This example policy indicates that AWS Elemental MediaStore should send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch at the container level. For example, this includes the RequestCount metric that counts the number of Put requests made to the container. Alternatively, you can set this to DISABLED. 
Because there are no rules in this policy, MediaStore does not send metrics at the path level. For example, you can't see how many Put requests were made to a particular folder within this container.
