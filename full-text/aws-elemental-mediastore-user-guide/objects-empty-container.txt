Emptying a container
You can empty a container to delete all objects that are stored within the container. Alternatively, you can add an object lifecycle policy to automatically delete objects after they reach a certain age in a container, or you can delete objects individually.
To empty a container (console)


Open the MediaStore console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/.


On the Containers page, choose the option for the container that you want to empty.


Choose Empty container. A confirmation message appears.


Type empty in the field, then choose Empty.
