Example CORS policy: Read access for a specific domain
The following policy allows a webpage from https://www.example.com to retrieve content from your AWS Elemental MediaStore container. The request includes all HTTP headers from https://www.example.com, and the service responds only to HTTP GET and HTTP HEAD requests from https://www.example.com. The results are cached for 3,000 seconds before a new set of results is delivered.
