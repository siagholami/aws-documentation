CORS use-case scenarios
The following are example scenarios for using CORS:
 Scenario 1: Suppose you are distributing live streaming video in an AWS Elemental MediaStore container named LiveVideo. Your users load the video manifest endpoint http://livevideo.mediastore.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com from a specific origin like www.example.com. You want to use a JavaScript video player to access videos that are originated from this container via unauthenticated GET and PUT requests. A browser would typically block JavaScript from allowing those requests, but you can set a CORS policy on your container to explicitly enable these requests from www.example.com.
 Scenario 2: Suppose you want to host the same live stream as in Scenario 1 from your MediaStore container, but want to allow requests from any origin. You can configure a CORS policy to allow wildcard (*) origins, so that requests from any origin can access the video.
