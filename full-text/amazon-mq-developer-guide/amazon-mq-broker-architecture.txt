Amazon MQ Broker Architecture
Amazon MQ brokers can be created as single-instance brokers or active/standby brokers. For both deployment modes, Amazon MQ provides high durability by storing its data redundantly.
Note
Amazon MQ uses Apache KahaDB as its data store. Other data stores, such as JDBC and LevelDB, aren't supported.
You can access your brokers by using any programming language that ActiveMQ supports and by enabling TLS explicitly for the following protocols:
 AMQP
 MQTT
 MQTT over WebSocket
 OpenWire
 STOMP
 STOMP over WebSocket
