Amazon MQ supports creating throughput-optimized brokers by using Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)—instead of the default Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)—for broker storage. To take advantage of high durability and replication across multiple Availability Zones, use Amazon EFS. To take advantage of low latency and high throughput, use Amazon EBS.   You can use Amazon EBS only with the mq.m5 broker instance type family.   Although you can change the broker instance type, you can't change the broker storage type after you create the broker.   Amazon EBS replicates data within a single Availability Zone and doesn't support the active/standby deployment mode.
