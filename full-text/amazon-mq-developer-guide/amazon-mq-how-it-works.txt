How Amazon MQ Works
Amazon MQ makes it easy to create a message broker with the computing and storage resources that fit your needs. You can create, manage, and delete brokers using the AWS Management Console, Amazon MQ REST API, or the AWS Command Line Interface.
This section describes the basic elements of a message broker, lists available Amazon MQ broker instance types and their statuses, provides an overview of broker architecture, explains broker configuration parameters and offers a working example of using Java Message Service (JMS) with an ActiveMQ broker.
To learn about Amazon MQ REST APIs, see the Amazon MQ REST API Reference.
