Tutorial: Creating and Configuring an Amazon MQ Broker
A broker is a message broker environment running on Amazon MQ. It is the basic building block of Amazon MQ. The combined description of the broker instance class (m5, t2) and size (large, micro) is a broker instance type (for example, mq.m5.large). For more information, see Broker.
The first and most common Amazon MQ task is creating a broker. The following example shows how you can use the AWS Management Console to create and configure a broker using the AWS Management Console.

Step 1: Configure Basic Broker Settings


Sign in to the Amazon MQ console.


On the Select deployment and storage page, in the Deployment mode and storage type section, do the following:


Choose the Deployment mode (for example, Active/standby broker). For more information, see Amazon MQ Broker Architecture.

A Single-instance broker is comprised of one broker in one Availability Zone. The broker communicates with your application and with Amazon EFS (by default) or with Amazon EBS. For more information, see Amazon MQ Single-Instance Broker.
An Active/standby broker for high availability is comprised of two brokers in two different Availability Zones, configured in a redundant pair. These brokers communicate synchronously with your application, and with Amazon EFS. For more information, see Amazon MQ Active/Standby Broker for High Availability.
For more information on the sample blueprints for a network of brokers, see Sample Blueprints.



Choose the Storage type (for example, EBS). For more information, see Storage.
Note
Amazon EBS replicates data within a single Availability Zone and doesn't support the active/standby deployment mode.


Choose Next.


On the Configure settings page, in the Details section, do the following:


Enter the Broker name.


Choose the Broker instance type (for example, mq.m5.large). For more information, see Instance Types.


In the ActiveMQ Web Console access section, type a Username and Password.


Step 2: (Optional) Configure Additional Broker Settings
Important
Subnet(s) – A single-instance broker requires one subnet (for example, the default subnet). An active/standby broker requires two subnets.
Security group(s) – Both single-instance brokers and active/standby brokers require at least one security group (for example, the default security group).
VPC – A broker's subnet(s) and security group(s) must be in the same VPC. EC2-Classic resources aren't supported. Amazon MQ only supports default VPC tenancy, and does not support dedicated VPC tenancy.
Encryption – Choose the customer master key to encrypt your data. See Encryption at Rest.
Public accessibility – Disabling public accessibility makes the broker accessible only within your VPC. For more information, see Prefer Brokers without Public Accessibility and Accessing the ActiveMQ Web Console of a Broker without Public Accessibility.


Expand the Additional settings section.


In the Configuration section, choose Create a new configuration with default values or Select an existing configuration. For more information, see Configuration and Amazon MQ Broker Configuration Parameters.


In the Logs section, choose whether to publish General logs and Audit logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see Configuring Amazon MQ to Publish General and Audit Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
Important
If you don't add the CreateLogGroup permission to your Amazon MQ user before the user creates or reboots the broker, Amazon MQ doesn't create the log group.
If you don't configure a resource-based policy for Amazon MQ, the broker can't publish the logs to CloudWatch Logs.


In the Network and security section, configure your broker's connectivity:


Do one of the following:

Choose Use the default VPC, subnet(s), and security group(s).

Choose Select existing VPC, subnet(s), and security group(s).


If you choose this option, you can create a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on the Amazon VPC console, select an existing VPC, or select the default VPC. For more information, see What is Amazon VPC? in the Amazon VPC User Guide.


After you create or select a VPC, you can create new Subnet(s) on the Amazon VPC console or select existing ones. For more information, see VPCs and Subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.


After you create or select subnets, you can select the Security group(s).






Choose the customer master key (CMK) that will be used to encrypt your data. See Encryption at Rest.


Choose the Public accessibility of your broker.


In the Maintenance section, configure your broker's maintenance schedule:


To upgrade the broker to new versions as Apache releases them, choose Enable automatic minor version upgrades. Automatic upgrades occur during the maintenance window defined by the day of the week, the time of day (in 24-hour format), and the time zone (UTC by default).
Note
For an active/standby broker, if one of the broker instances undergoes maintenance, it takes Amazon MQ a short while to take the inactive instance out of service. This allows the healthy standby instance to become active and to begin accepting incoming communications.


Do one of the following:

To allow Amazon MQ to select the maintenance window automatically, choose No preference.
To set a custom maintenance window, choose Select maintenance window and then specify the Start day and Start time of the upgrades.



Step 3: Finish Creating the Broker

Choose Deploy.

While Amazon MQ creates your broker, it displays the Creation in progress status. 
Creating the broker takes about 15 minutes.
When your broker is created successfully, Amazon MQ displays the Running status.


Choose MyBroker.

On the MyBroker page, in the Connect section, note your broker's ActiveMQ Web Console URL, for example:
https://b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:8162
Also, note your broker's wire-level protocol Endpoints. The following is an example of an OpenWire endpoint:
ssl://b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:61617
Note
For an active/standby broker, Amazon MQ provides two ActiveMQ Web Console URLs, but only one URL is active at a time. Likewise, Amazon MQ provides two endpoints for each wire-level protocol, but only one endpoint is active in each pair at a time. The -1 and -2 suffixes denote a redundant pair. For more information, see Amazon MQ Broker Architecture).
For wire-level protocol endpoints, you can allow your application to connect to either endpoint by using the Failover Transport.
