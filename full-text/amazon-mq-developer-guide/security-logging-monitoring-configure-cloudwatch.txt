Configuring Amazon MQ to Publish General and Audit Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs
Amazon MQ is integrated with Amazon CloudWatch Logs, a service that monitors, stores, and accesses your log files from a variety of sources. For example, you can configure CloudWatch alarms to receive notifications of broker reboots or troubleshoot broker configuration errors. For more information about CloudWatch Logs, see the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide.
To allow Amazon MQ to publish logs to CloudWatch Logs, you must add a permission to your Amazon MQ user and also configure a resource-based policy for Amazon MQ before you create or restart the broker.
For more information about configuring Amazon MQ to publish general and audit logs to CloudWatch Logs, see Configure Advanced Broker Settings.

Understanding the Structure of Logging in CloudWatch Logs
You can enable general and audit logging when you configure advanced broker settings when you create a broker, or when you edit a broker.
General logging enables the default INFO logging level (DEBUG logging isn't supported) and publishes activemq.log to a log group in your CloudWatch account. The log group has a format similar to the following:
/aws/amazonmq/broker/b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9/general
Audit logging enables logging of management actions taken using JMX or using the ActiveMQ Web Console and publishes audit.log to a log group in your CloudWatch account. The log group has a format similar to the following:
/aws/amazonmq/broker/b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9/audit
Depending on whether you have a single-instance broker or an active/standby broker, Amazon MQ creates either one or two log streams within each log group. The log streams have a format similar to the following.
activemq-b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.log
activemq-b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-2.log
The -1 and -2 suffixes denote individual broker instances. For more information, see Working with Log Groups and Log Streams in the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide. 
Add the CreateLogGroup Permission to Your Amazon MQ User
To allow Amazon MQ to create a CloudWatch Logs log group, you must ensure that the IAM user who creates or reboots the broker has the logs:CreateLogGroup permission.
Important
If you don't add the CreateLogGroup permission to your Amazon MQ user before the user creates or reboots the broker, Amazon MQ doesn't create the log group.
The following example IAM-based policy grants permission for logs:CreateLogGroup to user 111122223333.
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
            "AWS": "111122223333"
         },
         "Action": "logs:CreateLogGroup",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/amazonmq/*"
      }
   ]
}
Note
Here, the term user refers to IAM Users and not Amazon MQ users, which are created when a new broker is configured. For more information regarding setting up IAM users and configuring IAM policies, please refer to the Identity Management Overview section of the IAM User Guide. 
For more information, see [CreateLogGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLogGroup.html) in the Amazon CloudWatch Logs API Reference.
Configure a Resource-Based Policy for Amazon MQ
To allow Amazon MQ to publish logs to your CloudWatch Logs log group, configure a resource-based policy to give Amazon MQ access to the following CloudWatch Logs API actions:
 [CreateLogStream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLogStream.html) – Creates a CloudWatch Logs log stream for the specified log group.
 [PutLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html) – Delivers events to the specified CloudWatch Logs log stream.
Important
If you don't configure a resource-based policy for Amazon MQ, the broker can't publish the logs to CloudWatch Logs.
The following example resource-based policy grants permission for logs:CreateLogStream and logs:PutLogEvents to AWS.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "mq.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action":[
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource" : "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/amazonmq/*"
    }
  ]
}
Note
Because this example uses the /aws/amazonmq/ prefix, you need to configure the resource-based policy only once per AWS account, per region.
You can achieve the same effect using the following AWS CLI command:
aws --region us-east-1 logs put-resource-policy --policy-name AmazonMQ-logs \
        --policy-document '{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { 
        "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "Service": "mq.amazonaws.com" }, 
        "Action":[ "logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:PutLogEvents" ],
        "Resource" : "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/amazonmq/*" } ] }'
Troubleshooting CloudWatch Logs Configuration
In some cases, CloudWatch Logs might not always behave as expected. This section gives an overview of common issues and shows how to resolve them.
Log Groups Don't Appear in CloudWatch
Add the CreateLogGroup permission to your Amazon MQ user and reboot the broker. This allows Amazon MQ to create the log group.
Log Streams Don't Appear in CloudWatch Log Groups
Configure a resource-based policy for Amazon MQ. This allows your broker to publish its logs.
