Amazon MQ Broker Configuration Lifecycle
Making changes to a configuration revision or an ActiveMQ user does not apply the changes immediately. To apply your changes, you must wait for the next maintenance window or reboot the broker. For more information, see Amazon MQ Broker Configuration Lifecycle.

Important
The next scheduled maintenance window triggers a reboot. If the broker is rebooted before the next scheduled maintenance window, the changes are applied after the reboot.
