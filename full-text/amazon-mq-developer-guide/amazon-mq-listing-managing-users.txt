Tutorial: Creating and Managing Amazon MQ Broker Users
An ActiveMQ user is a person or an application that can access the queues and topics of an ActiveMQ broker. You can configure users to have specific permissions. For example, you can allow some users to access the ActiveMQ Web Console.
A group is a semantic label. You can assign a group to a user and configure permissions for groups to send to, receive from, and administer specific queues and topics.
Note
You can't configure groups independently of users. A group label is created when you add at least one user to it and deleted when you remove all users from it.
The following examples show how you can create, edit, and delete Amazon MQ broker users using the AWS Management Console.

To Create a New User


Sign in to the Amazon MQ console.


From the broker list, choose the name of your broker (for example, MyBroker) and then choose View details.


On the MyBroker page, in the Users section, all the users for this broker are listed.



Choose Create user.


In the Create user dialog box, type a Username and Password.


(Optional) Type the names of groups to which the user belongs, separated by commas (for example: Devs, Admins).


(Optional) To enable the user to access the ActiveMQ Web Console, choose ActiveMQ Web Console.

Making changes to a user does not apply the changes to the user immediately. To apply your changes, you must wait for the next maintenance window or reboot the broker. For more information, see Amazon MQ Broker Configuration Lifecycle.
