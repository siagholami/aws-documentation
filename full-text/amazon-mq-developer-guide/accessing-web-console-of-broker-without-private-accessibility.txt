Accessing the ActiveMQ Web Console of a Broker without Public Accessibility
If you disable public accessibility for your broker, you must perform the following steps to be able to access your broker's ActiveMQ Web Console.
Note
The names of the VPCs and security groups are specific to the following example.
Prerequisites
To perform the following steps, you must configure the following:
 VPCs
   The VPC without an internet gateway, to which the Amazon MQ broker is attached, named private-vpc.
   A second VPC, with an internet gateway, named public-vpc.
   Both VPCs must be connected (for example, using VPC peering) so that the Amazon EC2 instances in the public VPC can communicate with the EC2 instances in the private VPC.
   If you use VPC peering, the route tables for both VPCs must be configured for the peering connection.
 Security Groups
   The security group used to create the Amazon MQ broker, named private-sg.
   A second security group used for the EC2 instance in the public-vpc VPC, named public-sg.
   private-sg must allow inbound connections from public-sg. We recommend restricting this security group to port 8162.
   public-sg must allow inbound connections from your machine on port 22.
To Access the ActiveMQ Web Console of a Broker without Public Accessibility


Create a Linux EC2 instance in public-vpc (with a public IP, if necessary).


To verify that your VPC is configured correctly, establish an ssh connection to the EC2 instance and use the curl command with the URI of your broker.


From your machine, create an ssh tunnel to the EC2 instance using the path to your private key file and the IP address of your broker instance. For example:


ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N -C -q -f -D 8080 ec2-user@203.0.113.0
A forward proxy server is started on your machine.


Install a proxy client such as FoxyProxy on your machine.


Configure your proxy client using the following settings:
    For proxy type, specify SOCKS5.
    For IP address, DNS name, and server name, specify localhost.
    For port, specify 8080.
    Remove any existing URL patterns.
    For the URL pattern, specify *.mq.*.amazonaws.com*
    For the connection type, specify HTTP(S).


When you enable your proxy client, you can access the ActiveMQ Web Console on your machine.
