User
An ActiveMQ user is a person or an application that can access the queues and topics of an ActiveMQ broker. You can configure users to have specific permissions. For example, you can allow some users to access the ActiveMQ Web Console.
A group is a semantic label. You can assign a group to a user and configure permissions for groups to send to, receive from, and administer specific queues and topics.
Important
Making changes to a user does not apply the changes to the user immediately. To apply your changes, you must wait for the next maintenance window or reboot the broker. For more information, see Amazon MQ Broker Configuration Lifecycle.
