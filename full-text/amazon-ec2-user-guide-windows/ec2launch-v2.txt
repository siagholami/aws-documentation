Configuring a Windows instance using EC2Launch v2
All supported instances of Amazon EC2 running Windows Server include the EC2Launch v2 service (EC2Launch.exe). EC2Launch v2 performs tasks during instance startup and runs if an instance is stopped and later started, or restarted. EC2Launch v2 can also perform tasks on demand. Some of these tasks are automatically enabled, while others must be enabled manually. The EC2Launch v2 service supports all EC2Config and EC2Launch features. 
This service uses a configuration file to control its operation. You can update the configuration file using either a graphical tool or by directly editing it as a single .yml file (agent-config.yml). The service binaries are located in the %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2Launch directory.
EC2Launch v2 publishes Windows event logs to help you troubleshoot errors and set triggers. For more information, see Windows event logs.
