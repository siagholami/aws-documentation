Adding Windows components Using installation media
Windows Server operating systems include many optional components. Including all optional components in each Amazon EC2 Windows Server AMI is not practical. Instead, we provide you with installation media EBS snapshots that have the necessary files to configure or install components on your Windows instance.
To access and install the optional components, you must find the correct EBS snapshot for your version of Windows Server, create a volume from the snapshot, and attach the volume to your instance.
Before you begin
Use the AWS Management Console or a command line tool to get the instance ID and Availability Zone of your instance. You must create your EBS volume in the same Availability Zone as your instance.
Adding Windows components using the console
Use the following procedure to use the AWS Management Console to add Windows components to your instance.
To add Windows components to your instance using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Snapshots.


From the Filter bar, choose Public Snapshots.


Add the Owner filter and choose Amazon images.


Add the Description filter and type Windows.


Press Enter


Select the snapshot that matches your system architecture and language preference. For example, select Windows 2019 English Installation Media if your instance is running Windows Server 2019.


Choose Actions, Create Volume.


In the Create Volume dialog box, select the Availability Zone that matches your Windows instance, and then choose Create.


In the Volume Successfully Created message, choose the volume that you just created.


Choose Actions, Attach Volume.


In the Attach Volume dialog box, type the instance ID and the name of the device for the attachment, and choose Attach. If you need help with the device name, see Device Naming. 


Connect to your instance and make the volume available. For more information, see Making an Amazon EBS volume available for use on Windows.
Important
Do not initialize the volume.


Open Control Panel, Programs and Features. Choose Turn Windows features on or off. If you are prompted for installation media, specify the EBS volume with the installation media.


Adding Windows components using the Tools for Windows PowerShell
Use the following procedure to use the Tools for Windows PowerShell to add Windows components to your instance.

Use the Get-EC2Snapshot cmdlet with the Owner and description filters to get a list of the available installation media snapshots.

PS C:\> Get-EC2Snapshot -Owner amazon -Filter @{ Name="description"; Values="Windows*" }

In the output, note the ID of the snapshot that matches your system architecture and language preference. For example:

...
   DataEncryptionKeyId :
   Description         : Windows 2019 English Installation Media
   Encrypted           : False
   KmsKeyId            :
   OwnerAlias          : amazon
   OwnerId             : 123456789012
   Progress            : 100%
   SnapshotId          : snap-22da283e
   StartTime           : 10/25/2019 8:00:47 PM
   State               : completed
   StateMessage        :
   Tags                : {}
   VolumeId            : vol-be5eafcb
   VolumeSize          : 6
   ...

Use the New-EC2Volume cmdlet to create a volume from the snapshot. Specify the same Availability Zone as your instance.

PS C:\> New-EC2Volume -AvailabilityZone us-east-1a -VolumeType gp2 -SnapshotId snap-22da283e

In the output, note the volume ID.

Attachments      : {}
   AvailabilityZone : us-east-1a
   CreateTime       : 4/18/2017 10:50:25 AM
   Encrypted        : False
   Iops             : 100
   KmsKeyId         :
   Size             : 6
   SnapshotId       : snap-22da283e
   State            : creating
   Tags             : {}
   VolumeId         : vol-06aa9e1fbf8b82ed1
   VolumeType       : gp2

Use the Add-EC2Volume cmdlet to attach the volume to your instance.

PS C:\> Add-EC2Volume -InstanceId i-087711ddaf98f9489 -VolumeId vol-06aa9e1fbf8b82ed1 -Device xvdh


Connect to your instance and make the volume available. For more information, see Making an Amazon EBS volume available for use on Windows.
Important
Do not initialize the volume.


Open Control Panel, Programs and Features. Choose Turn Windows features on or off. If you are prompted for installation media, specify the EBS volume with the installation media.


Adding Windows components using the AWS CLI

To add Windows components to your instance using the AWS CLI

Use the describe-snapshots command with the owner-ids parameter and description filter to get a list of the available installation media snapshots.

aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-ids amazon --filters Name=description,Values=Windows*

In the output, note the ID of the snapshot that matches your system architecture and language preference. For example:

{
       "Snapshots": [
       ...
           {
               "OwnerAlias": "amazon", 
               "Description": "Windows 2019 English Installation Media", 
               "Encrypted": false, 
               "VolumeId": "vol-be5eafcb", 
               "State": "completed", 
               "VolumeSize": 6, 
               "Progress": "100%", 
               "StartTime": "2019-10-25T20:00:47.000Z", 
               "SnapshotId": "snap-22da283e",

           }, 
       ...
      ]
   }

Use the create-volume command to create a volume from the snapshot. Specify the same Availability Zone as your instance.

aws ec2 create-volume --snapshot-id snap-22da283e --volume-type gp2 --availability-zone us-east-1a
