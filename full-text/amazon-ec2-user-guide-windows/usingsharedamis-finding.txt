Finding shared AMIs
You can use the Amazon EC2 console or the command line to find shared AMIs. 
AMIs are a regional resource. Therefore, when searching for a shared AMI (public or private), you must search for it from within the Region from which it is being shared. To make an AMI available in a different Region, copy the AMI to the Region and then share it. For more information, see Copying an AMI.
Finding a shared AMI (console)
To find a shared private AMI using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose AMIs. 


In the first filter, choose Private images. All AMIs that have been shared with you are listed. To granulate your search, choose the Search bar and use the filter options provided in the menu.


To find a shared public AMI using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose AMIs.


In the first filter, choose Public images. To granulate your search, choose the Search bar and use the filter options provided in the menu.


Use filters to list only the types of AMIs that interest you. For example, choose Owner : and then choose Amazon images to display only Amazon's public images.


Finding a shared AMI (Tools for Windows PowerShell)
Use the Get-EC2Image command (Tools for Windows PowerShell) to list AMIs. You can scope the list to the types of AMIs that interest you, as shown in the following examples.
Example: List all public AMIs
The following command lists all public AMIs, including any public AMIs that you own.
PS C:\> Get-EC2Image -ExecutableUser all
Example: List AMIs with explicit launch permissions
The following command lists the AMIs for which you have explicit launch permissions. This list does not include any AMIs that you own.
PS C:\> Get-EC2Image -ExecutableUser self
Example: List AMIs owned by Amazon
The following command lists the AMIs owned by Amazon. Amazon's public AMIs have an aliased owner, which appears as amazon in the account field. This enables you to find AMIs from Amazon easily. Other users can't alias their AMIs.
PS C:\> Get-EC2Image -Owner amazon
Example: List AMIs owned by an account
The following command lists the AMIs owned by the specified AWS account.
PS C:\> Get-EC2Image -Owner 123456789012
Example: Scope AMIs using a filter
To reduce the number of displayed AMIs, use a filter to list only the types of AMIs that interest you. For example, use the following filter to display only EBS-backed AMIs.
-Filter @{ Name="root-device-type"; Values="ebs" }
