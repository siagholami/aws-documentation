Working with Elastic Graphics
You can launch an instance and associate it with an Elastic Graphics accelerator during launch. You must then manually install the necessary libraries on your instance that enable communication with the accelerator. For limitations, see Elastic Graphics limitations.

Configuring your security groups
If you use the Amazon EC2 console to launch your instance with an Elastic Graphics accelerator and create a security group for you, the console adds the inbound and outbound rules that are required to allow traffic on the Elastic Graphics port. If you are launching your instance using the AWS CLI or an SDK, you must ensure that your security group allows traffic on the Elastic Graphics port.
To create a security group for Elastic Graphics


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Security Groups, Create Security Group.


Provide a name for your security group, such as "Elastic Graphics security group", and a description for the security group. Select the VPC that you will use to launch your instance with an Elastic Graphics accelerator.


Create an inbound security group rule as follows:


On the Inbound tab, choose Add Rule


For Type, choose Elastic Graphics. For Source, choose Custom and type the ID of the security group.


Create an outbound security group rule as follows:


On the Outbound tab, choose Add Rule


For Type, choose All TCP. For Destination, choose Custom and type the ID of the security group.


Choose Create.


For more information, see Amazon EC2 security groups for Windows instances.
Launching an instance with an Elastic Graphics accelerator
You can associate an Elastic Graphics accelerator to an instance during launch. If the launch fails, the following are possible reasons:
 Insufficient Elastic Graphics accelerator capacity
 Exceeded limit on Elastic Graphics accelerators in the Region
 Not enough private IPv4 addresses in your VPC to create a network interface for the accelerator
For more information, see Elastic Graphics limitations.
To associate an Elastic Graphics accelerator during instance launch (console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


From the dashboard, choose Launch Instance.


Select a Windows AMI and a supported instance type. For more information, see Elastic Graphics basics.


On the Configure Instance Details page, select a VPC and subnet in which to launch your instance.


Choose Add Graphics Acceleration, and select an Elastic Graphics accelerator type.


(Optional) On the Add Storage and Add Tags pages, add volumes and tags as needed.


On the Configure Security Group page, you can let the console create a security group for you with the required inbound and outbound rules, or you can use the security group that you created manually in Configuring your security groups. Add additional security groups as needed.


Choose Review and Launch to review your instance options and then choose Launch.


To associate an Elastic Graphics accelerator during instance launch (AWS CLI)
You can use the run-instances AWS CLI command with the following parameter:
--elastic-gpu-specification Type=eg1.medium
For the --security-group-ids parameter, you must include a security group that has the required inbound and outbound rules. For more information, see Configuring your security groups.
To associate an Elastic Graphics accelerator during instance launch (Tools for Windows PowerShell)
Use the New-EC2Instance Tools for Windows PowerShell command.
Installing the required software for Elastic Graphics
If you launched your instance using a current AWS Windows AMI, the required software is installed automatically during the first boot. If you launched your instance using Windows AMIs that do not automatically install the required software, you must install the required software on the instance manually.
To install the required software for Elastic Graphics (if necessary)


Connect to the instance.


Download the Elastic Graphics installer and open it. The installation manager connects to the Elastic Graphics endpoint and downloads the latest version of the required software.


Reboot the instance to verify.


Verifying Elastic Graphics functionality on your instance
The Elastic Graphics packages on your instance include tools that you can use to view the status of the accelerator, and to verify that OpenGL commands from your instance to the accelerator are functional.
If your instance was launched with an AMI that does not have the Elastic Graphics packages pre-installed, you can download and install them yourself. For more information, see Installing the required software for Elastic Graphics.

Using the Elastic Graphics status monitor
You can use the status monitor tool to view information about the status of an attached Elastic Graphics accelerator. By default, this tool is available in the notification area of the taskbar in your Windows instance and shows the status of the graphics accelerator. The following are the possible values.
Healthy
The Elastic Graphics accelerator is enabled and healthy.
Updating
The status of the Elastic Graphics accelerator is currently updating. It might take a few minutes to display the status.
Out of service
The Elastic Graphics accelerator is out of service. To get more information about the error, choose Read More.
Using the Elastic Graphics command line tool
You can use the Elastic Graphics command line tool, egcli.exe, to check the status of the accelerator. If there is a problem with the accelerator, the tool returns an error message.
To launch the tool, open a command prompt from within your instance and run the following command:
C:\Program Files\Amazon\EC2ElasticGPUs\manager\egcli.exe
The tool also supports the following parameters:
--json, -j
Indicates whether to show the JSON message. The possible values are true and false. The default is true.
--imds, -i
Indicates whether to check the instance metadata for the availability of the accelerator. The possible values are true and false. The default is true.
The following is example output. A status of OK indicates that the accelerator is enabled and healthy.
EG Infrastructure is available.
Instance ID egpu-f6d94dfa66df4883b284e96db7397ee6
Instance Type eg1.large
EG Version 1.0.0.885 (Manager) / 1.0.0.95 (OpenGL Library) / 1.0.0.69 (OpenGL Redirector)
EG Status: Healthy
JSON Message:
{
  "version": "2016-11-30",
  "status": "OK"
}
The following are the possible values for status:
OK
The Elastic Graphics accelerator is enabled and healthy.
UPDATING
The Elastic Graphics driver is being updated.
NEEDS_REBOOT
The Elastic Graphics driver has been updated and a reboot of the Amazon EC2 instance is required.
LOADING_DRIVER
The Elastic Graphics driver is being loaded.
CONNECTING_EGPU
The Elastic Graphics driver is verifying the connectivity with the Elastic Graphics accelerator.
ERROR_UPDATE_RETRY
An error occurred while updating the Elastic Graphics driver, an update will be retried soon.
ERROR_UPDATE
An unrecoverable error occurred while updating the Elastic Graphics driver.
ERROR_LOAD_DRIVER
An error occurred loading the Elastic Graphics driver.
ERROR_EGPU_CONNECTIVITY
The Elastic Graphics accelerator is unreacheable.
