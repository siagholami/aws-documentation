Reboot your instance
An instance reboot is equivalent to an operating system reboot. In most cases, it takes only a few minutes to reboot your instance. When you reboot an instance, it keeps its public DNS name (IPv4), private IPv4 address, IPv6 address (if applicable), and any data on its instance store volumes.
Rebooting an instance doesn't start a new instance billing hour, unlike stopping and starting your instance.
We might schedule your instance for a reboot for necessary maintenance, such as to apply updates that require a reboot. No action is required on your part; we recommend that you wait for the reboot to occur within its scheduled window. For more information, see Scheduled events for your instances.
We recommend that you use the Amazon EC2 console, a command line tool, or the Amazon EC2 API to reboot your instance instead of running the operating system reboot command from your instance. If you use the Amazon EC2 console, a command line tool, or the Amazon EC2 API to reboot your instance, we perform a hard reboot if the instance does not cleanly shut down within a few minutes. If you use AWS CloudTrail, then using Amazon EC2 to reboot your instance also creates an API record of when your instance was rebooted.
If Windows is installing updates on your instance, we recommend that you do not reboot or shut down your instance using the Amazon EC2 console or the command line until all the updates are installed. When you use the Amazon EC2 console or the command line to reboot or shut down your instance, there is a risk that your instance will be hard rebooted. A hard reboot while updates are being installed could throw your instance into an unstable state.
To reboot an instance using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances.


Select the instance and choose Actions, Instance State, Reboot.


Choose Yes, Reboot when prompted for confirmation. The instance will remain in a "running" state. 


To reboot an instance using the command line
You can use one of the following commands. For more information about these command line interfaces, see Accessing Amazon EC2.
