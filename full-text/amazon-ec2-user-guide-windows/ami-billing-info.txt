Obtaining billing information
You can determine the platform details and billing information associated with an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) before you launch an On-Demand Instance or Spot Instance, or purchase a Reserved Instance. For Spot Instances, you can use the platform details to confirm that the AMI is supported for Spot Instances. When purchasing a Reserved Instance, you can make sure that, for Platform, you select the correct value that maps to Platform details on the AMI. By knowing the billing information before launching an instance or purchasing a Reserved Instance, you reduce the chance of erroneously launching instances from incorrect AMIs and incurring unplanned costs.
For more information about instance pricing, see Amazon EC2 pricing.

AMI billing information fields
The following fields provide billing information associated with an AMI:
Platform details
 The platform details associated with the billing code of the AMI. For example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Usage operation
The operation of the Amazon EC2 instance and the billing code that is associated with the AMI. For example, RunInstances:0010. Usage operation corresponds to the lineitem/Operation column on your AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) and in the AWS Price List API. For the list of Usage operation codes, see Platform details and usage operation values in the following section.
You can view these fields on the Instances or AMIs page in the Amazon EC2 console, or in the response that is returned by the describe-images command.
Platform details and usage operation values
The following table lists the platform details and usage operation values that can be displayed on the Instances or AMIs page in the Amazon EC2 console, or in the response that is returned by the describe-images command.

* If two software licenses are associated with an AMI, the Platform details field shows both.
** If you are running Spot Instances, the [lineitem/Operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/Lineitem-columns.html#Lineitem-details-O-Operation) on your AWS Cost and Usage Report might be different from the Usage operation value that is listed here. For example, if [lineitem/Operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/Lineitem-columns.html#Lineitem-details-O-Operation) displays RunInstances:0010:SV006, it means that Amazon EC2 is running Red Hat Enterprise Linux Spot Instance-hour in US East (Virginia) in VPC Zone #6.
Viewing platform details and usage operation values
You can view the platform details and usage operation values associated with an AMI from the AMI or from the instance. You can view these values in the Amazon EC2 console or by using the AWS CLI.
From the AMI
To view the platform details and usage operation associated with an AMI (console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose AMIs, and then select an AMI.


On the Details tab, check the values for Platform details and Usage operation.


To view the platform details and usage operation associated with an AMI (AWS CLI)
Use the describe-images command.
$ aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids ami-0123456789EXAMPLE
The following example output shows the PlatformDetails and UsageOperation fields. In this example, the ami-0123456789EXAMPLE platform is Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the usage operation and billing code is RunInstances:0010.

From the instance
To view the platform details and usage operation associated with an AMI (console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances, and then select an instance.


On the Details tab, check the values for Platform details and Usage operation.


To view the platform details and usage operation associated with an AMI (console)
After you have launched an instance, you can find the billing information by inspecting the billingProducts field in the instance metadata. For more information, see Instance identity documents. Alternatively, you can use the describe-instances command to obtain the AMI ID for the instance, and then use the describe-images command, as described in the preceding procedure, to obtain the billing information from the PlatformDetails and UsageOperation fields in the response.
Confirm billing information on your bill
To ensure that you're not incurring unplanned costs, you can confirm that the billing information for an instance in your AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) matches the billing information associated with the AMI that you used to launch the instance. To confirm the billing information, find the instance ID in your CUR and check the corresponding value in the [lineitem/Operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/Lineitem-columns.html#Lineitem-details-O-Operation) column. The value should match the value for Usage operation associated with the AMI.
For example, the AMI, ami-0123456789EXAMPLE, has the following billing information: Platform details = Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Usage operation = RunInstances:0010. If you launched an instance using this AMI, you can find the instance ID in your CUR and check the corresponding value in the [lineitem/Operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/Lineitem-columns.html#Lineitem-details-O-Operation) column. In this example, the value should be RunInstances:0010.
