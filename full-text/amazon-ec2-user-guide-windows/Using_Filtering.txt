Listing and filtering your resources
You can get a list of some types of resource using the Amazon EC2 console. You can get a list of each type of resource using its corresponding command or API action. If you have many resources, you can filter the results to include only the resources that match certain criteria.

Advanced search
Advanced search allows you to search using a combination of filters to achieve precise results. You can filter by keywords, user-defined tag keys, and predefined resource attributes.
The specific search types available are:
 Search by keyword
To search by keyword, type or paste what you’re looking for in the search box, and then choose Enter. For example, to search for a specific instance, you can type the instance ID.
 Search by fields
You can also search by fields, tags, and attributes associated with a resource. For example, to find all instances in the stopped state:


In the search box, start typing Instance State. As you type, you'll see a list of suggested fields.


Select Instance State from the list.


Select Stopped from the list of suggested values.


To further refine your list, select the search box for more search options.
 Advanced search


You can create advanced queries by adding multiple filters. For example, you can search by tags and see instances for the Flying Mountain project running in the Production stack, and then search by attributes to see all t2.micro instances, or all instances in us-west-2a, or both. 
 Inverse search
You can search for resources that do not match a specified value. For example, to list all instances that are not terminated, search by the Instance State field, and prefix the Terminated value with an exclamation mark (!).
 Partial search
When searching by field, you can also enter a partial string to find all resources that contain the string in that field. For example, search by Instance Type, and then type t2 to find all t2.micro, t2.small or t2.medium instances.
 Regular expression
Regular expressions are useful when you need to match the values in a field with a specific pattern. For example, search by the Name tag, and then type ^s.* to see all instances with a Name tag that starts with an 's'. Regular expression search is not case-sensitive.
After you have the precise results of your search, you can bookmark the URL for easy reference. In situations where you have thousands of instances, filters and bookmarks can save you a great deal of time; you don’t have to run searches repeatedly.
Combining search filters
In general, multiple filters with the same key field (for example, tag:Name, search, Instance State) are automatically joined with OR. This is intentional, as the vast majority of filters would not be logical if they were joined with AND. For example, you would get zero results for a search on Instance State=running AND Instance State=stopped. In many cases, you can granulate the results by using complementary search terms on different key fields, where the AND rule is automatically applied instead. If you search for tag: Name:=All values and tag:Instance State=running, you get search results that contain both those criteria. To fine-tune your results, simply remove one filter in the string until the results fit your requirements.
Listing resources using the console
You can view the most common Amazon EC2 resource types using the console. To view additional resources, use the command line interface or the API actions.
To list EC2 resources using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose the option that corresponds to the resource, such as AMIs or Instances.



The page displays all the available resources.


Filtering resources using the console
You can perform filtering and sorting of the most common resource types using the Amazon EC2 console. For example, you can use the search bar on the instances page to sort instances by tags, attributes, or keywords. 
You can also use the search field on each page to find resources with specific attributes or values. You can use regular expressions to search on partial or multiple strings. For example, to find all instances that are using the MySG security group, enter MySG in the search field. The results will include any values that contain MySG as a part of the string, such as MySG2 andMySG3. To limit your results to MySG only, enter \bMySG\b in the search field. To list all the instances whose type is either m1.small or m1.large, enter m1.small|m1.large in the search field. 
To list volumes in the us-east-1b Availability Zone with a status of available


In the navigation pane, choose Volumes.


Click on the search box, select Attachment Status from the menu, and then select Detached. (A detached volume is available to be attached to an instance in the same Availability Zone.)


Click on the search box again, select State, and then select Available. 


Click on the search box again, select Availability Zone, and then select us-east-1b.


Any volumes that meet this criteria are displayed.


To list public 64-bit Windows AMIs backed by Amazon EBS


In the navigation pane, choose AMIs.


In the Filter pane, select Public images, EBS images, and then Windows from the Filter lists.


Type x86_64 in the search field.


Any AMIs that meet this criteria are displayed.


Listing and filtering using the CLI and API
Each resource type has a corresponding CLI command and API action that you use to list resources of that type. The resulting lists of resources can be long, so it can be faster and more useful to filter the results to include only the resources that match specific criteria.
Filtering considerations
 You can specify multiple filters and multiple filter values in a single request.
 You can use wildcards with the filter values. An asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters, and a question mark (?) matches zero or one character.
 Filter values are case sensitive.
 Your search can include the literal values of the wildcard characters; you just need to escape them with a backslash before the character. For example, a value of \*amazon\?\\ searches for the literal string *amazon?\.
Supported filters
To see the supported filters for each Amazon EC2 resource, see the following documentation:
 AWS CLI: The describe commands in the AWS CLI Command Reference-Amazon EC2.
 Tools for Windows PowerShell: The Get commands in the AWS Tools for PowerShell Cmdlet Reference-Amazon EC2.
 Query API: The Describe API actions in the Amazon EC2 API Reference.
Example: Specify a single filter
You can list your Amazon EC2 instances using describe-instances. Without filters, the response contains information for all your resources. You can use the following command to include only the running instances in your output.  
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=instance-state-name,Values=running
To list only the instance IDs for your running instances, add the --query parameter as follows.  
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=instance-state-name,Values=running --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId" --output text
The following is example output:  
i-0ef1f57f78d4775a4
i-0626d4edd54f1286d
i-04a636d18e83cfacb
Example: Specify multiple filters or filter values
If you specify multiple filters or multiple filter values, the resource must match all filters to be included in the results.
You can you the following command to list all instances whose type is either m5.large or m5d.large.  
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=instance-type,Values=m5.large,m5d.large
You can use the following command to list all stopped instances whose type is t2.micro.  
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=instance-state-name,Values=stopped Name=instance-type,Values=t2.micro
Example: Use wildcards in a filter value
If you specify database as the filter value for the description filter when describing EBS snapshots using describe-snapshots, the command returns only the snapshots whose description is "database".  
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --filters Name=description,Values=database
The * wildcard matches zero or more characters. If you specify *database* as the filter value, the command returns only snapshots whose description includes the word database.  
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --filters Name=description,Values=*database*
The ? wildcard matches exactly 1 character. If you specify database? as the filter value, the command returns only snapshots whose description is "database" or "database" followed by one character.  
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --filters Name=description,Values=database?
If you specify database????, the command returns only snapshots whose description is "database" followed by up to four characters. It excludes descriptions with "database" followed by five or more characters.  
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --filters Name=description,Values=database????
Example: Filter based on date
With the AWS CLI, you can use JMESPath to filter results using expressions. For example, the following describe-snapshots command displays the IDs of all snapshots created by your AWS account (represented by 123456789012) before the specified date (represented by 2020-03-31). If you do not specify the owner, the results include all public snapshots.  
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --filters Name=owner-id,Values=123456789012 --query "Snapshots[?(StartTime<=`2020-03-31`)].[SnapshotId]" --output text
The following command displays the IDs of all snapshots created in the specified date range.  
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --filters Name=owner-id,Values=123456789012 --query "Snapshots[?(StartTime>=`2019-01-01`) && (StartTime<=`2019-12-31`)].[SnapshotId]" --output text
Filter based on tags
For examples of how to filter a list of resources according to their tags, see Working with tags using the command line.
