CPU credits and baseline utilization for burstable performance instances
Traditional Amazon EC2 instance types provide fixed CPU utilization, while burstable performance instances provide a baseline level of CPU utilization with the ability to burst CPU utilization above the baseline level. The baseline utilization and ability to burst are governed by CPU credits.
A CPU credit provides for 100% utilization of a full CPU core for one minute. Other combinations of number of vCPUs, utilization, and time can also equate to one CPU credit. For example, one CPU credit is equal to one vCPU running at 50% utilization for two minutes, or two vCPUs running at 25% utilization for two minutes.

Earning CPU credits
Each burstable performance instance continuously earns (at a millisecond-level resolution) a set rate of CPU credits per hour, depending on the instance size. The accounting process for whether credits are accrued or spent also happens at a millisecond-level resolution, so you don't have to worry about overspending CPU credits; a short burst of CPU uses a small fraction of a CPU credit.
If a burstable performance instance uses fewer CPU resources than is required for baseline utilization (such as when it is idle), the unspent CPU credits are accrued in the CPU credit balance. If a burstable performance instance needs to burst above the baseline utilization level, it spends the accrued credits. The more credits that a burstable performance instance has accrued, the more time it can burst beyond its baseline when more CPU utilization is needed.
The following table lists the burstable performance instance types, the rate at which CPU credits are earned per hour, the maximum number of earned CPU credits that an instance can accrue, the number of vCPUs per instance, and the baseline utilization as a percentage of a full core (using a single vCPU).

* The number of credits that can be accrued is equivalent to the number of credits that can be earned in a 24-hour period.


** The percentage baseline utilization in the table is per vCPU. In CloudWatch, CPU utilization is shown per vCPU. For example, the CPU utilization for a t3.large instance operating at the baseline level is shown as 30% in CloudWatch CPU metrics. For information about how to calculate the baseline utilization, see Baseline utilization.



CPU credit earn rate
The number of CPU credits earned per hour is determined by the instance size. For example, a t3.nano earns six credits per hour, while a t3.small earns 24 credits per hour. The preceding table lists the credit earn rate for all instances.
CPU credit accrual limit
While earned credits never expire on a running instance, there is a limit to the number of earned credits that an instance can accrue. The limit is determined by the CPU credit balance limit. After the limit is reached, any new credits that are earned are discarded, as indicated by the following image. The full bucket indicates the CPU credit balance limit, and the spillover indicates the newly earned credits that exceed the limit.

The CPU credit balance limit differs for each instance size. For example, a t3.micro instance can accrue a maximum of 288 earned CPU credits in the CPU credit balance. The preceding table lists the maximum number of earned credits that each instance can accrue.
T2 Standard instances also earn launch credits. Launch credits do not count towards the CPU credit balance limit. If a T2 instance has not spent its launch credits, and remains idle over a 24-hour period while accruing earned credits, its CPU credit balance appears as over the limit. For more information, see Launch credits. 
T3 instances do not earn launch credits. These instances launch as unlimited by default, and therefore can burst immediately upon start without any launch credits.
Accrued CPU credits life span
CPU credits on a running instance do not expire.
For T2, the CPU credit balance does not persist between instance stops and starts. If you stop a T2 instance, the instance loses all its accrued credits.
For T3, the CPU credit balance persists for seven days after an instance stops and the credits are lost thereafter. If you start the instance within seven days, no credits are lost.
For more information, see CPUCreditBalance in the CloudWatch metrics table.
Baseline utilization
The baseline utilization is the level at which the CPU can be utilized for a net credit balance of zero, when the number CPU credits being earned matches the number of CPU credits being used. Baseline utilization is also known as the baseline.
Baseline utilization is expressed as a percentage of vCPU utilization, which is calculated as follows:
(number of credits earned/number of vCPUs)/60 minutes = % baseline utilization
For example, a t3.nano instance, with 2 vCPUs, earns 6 credits per hour, resulting in a baseline utilization of 5% , which is calculated as follows:
(6 credits earned/2 vCPUs)/60 minutes = 5% baseline utilization
A t3.xlarge instance, with 4 vCPUs, earns 96 credits per hour, resulting in a baseline utilization of 40% ((96/4)/60).
