Amazon EBS and NVMe on Windows instances
EBS volumes are exposed as NVMe block devices on instances built on the Nitro System. 
The EBS performance guarantees stated in Amazon EBS Product Details are valid regardless of the block-device interface.

Install or upgrade the NVMe driver
The AWS Windows AMIs for Windows Server 2008 R2 and later include the AWS NVMe driver. If you are not using the latest AWS Windows AMIs provided by Amazon, see Installing or upgrading AWS NVMe drivers.
Identifying the EBS device
EBS uses single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide volume attachments on Nitro-based instances using the NVMe specification. These devices rely on standard NVMe drivers on the operating system. These drivers typically discover attached devices by scanning the PCI bus during instance boot, and create device nodes based on the order in which the devices respond, not on how the devices are specified in the block device mapping. 
Windows Server 2008 R2 and later
You can also run the ebsnvme-id command to map the NVMe device disk number to an EBS volume ID and device name. By default, all EBS NVMe devices are enumerated. You can pass a disk number to enumerate information for a specific device. Ebsnvme-id is included in the latest AWS provided Windows Server AMIs located in C:\PROGRAMDATA\AMAZON\Tools.
You can also download ebsnvme-id.zip and extract the contents to your Amazon EC2 instance to get access to ebsnvme-id.exe.

Working with NVMe EBS volumes
The latest AWS Windows AMIs contain the AWS NVMe driver that is required by instance types that expose EBS volumes as NVMe block devices. However, if you resize your root volume on a Windows system, you must rescan the volume in order for this change to be reflected in the instance. If you launched your instance from a different AMI, it might not contain the required AWS NVMe driver. If your instance does not have the latest AWS NVMe driver, you must install it. For more information, see AWS NVMe drivers for Windows instances.
I/O operation timeout
Most operating systems specify a timeout for I/O operations submitted to NVMe devices. On Windows systems, the default timeout is 60 seconds and the maximum is 255 seconds. You can modify the TimeoutValue disk class registry setting using the procedure described in Registry Entries for SCSI Miniport Drivers.
