Identify EC2 Windows instances
Your application might need to determine whether it is running on an EC2 instance.
For information about identifying Linux instances, see Identify EC2 Linux Instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Inspecting the instance identity document
For a definitive and cryptographically verified method of identifying an EC2 instance, check the instance identity document, including its signature. These documents are available on every EC2 instance at the local, non-routable address http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/. For more information, see Instance identity documents.
Inspecting the system UUID
You can get the system UUID and look for the presence of the characters "EC2" in the beginning octet of the UUID. This method to determine whether a system is an EC2 instance is quick but potentially inaccurate because there is a small chance that a system that is not an EC2 instance could have a UUID that starts with these characters. Furthermore, EC2 instances using SMBIOS 2.4 might represent the UUID in little-endian format, therefore the "EC2" characters do not appear at the beginning of the UUID.
Example : Get the UUID using WMI or Windows PowerShell
Use the Windows Management Instrumentation command line (WMIC) as follows:  
wmic path win32_computersystemproduct get uuid
Alternatively, if you're using Windows PowerShell, use the Get-WmiObject cmdlet as follows:  
PS C:\> Get-WmiObject -query "select uuid from Win32_ComputerSystemProduct" | Select UUID
In the following example output, the UUID starts with "EC2", which indicates that the system is probably an EC2 instance.  
EC2AE145-D1DC-13B2-94ED-01234ABCDEF
For instances using SMBIOS 2.4, the UUID might be represented in little-endian format; for example:  
45E12AEC-DCD1-B213-94ED-01234ABCDEF
