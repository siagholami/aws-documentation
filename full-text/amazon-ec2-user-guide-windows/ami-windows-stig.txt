Amazon EC2 Windows Server AMIs for STIG compliance
Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are the configuration standards created by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to secure information systems and software. To make your systems compliant with STIG standards, you must install, configure, and test a variety of security settings. Amazon EC2 Windows Server AMIs for STIG Compliance are pre-configured with over 160 required security settings. STIG-compliant operating systems include Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019. The STIG-compliant AMIs include updated Department of Defense (DoD) certificates to help you get started and achieve STIG compliance. There are no additional charges for using STIG-compliant AMIs.
Amazon EC2 Windows Server AMIs for STIG compliance are available in all public AWS and GovCloud regions. You can launch instances from these AMIs directly from the Amazon EC2 console. They are billed using standard Windows pricing.
The STIG-compliant Amazon EC2 AMIs for Windows Server can be found in the Community AMIs when you create an instance. The AMI names are as follows (YYYY.MM.DD denotes the latest version. You can search for the version without the date suffix.)
