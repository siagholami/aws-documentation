CloudWatch metrics for On-Demand Capacity Reservations
With CloudWatch metrics, you can efficiently monitor your Capacity Reservations and identify unused capacity by setting CloudWatch alarms to notify you when usage thresholds are met. This can help you maintain a constant Capacity Reservation volume and achieve a higher level of utilization.
On-Demand Capacity Reservations send metric data to CloudWatch every five minutes. Metrics are not supported for Capacity Reservations that are active for less than five minutes.
For more information about viewing metrics in the CloudWatch console, see Using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics. For more information about creating alarms, see Creating Amazon CloudWatch Alarms.
