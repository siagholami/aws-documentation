Deleting an Amazon EBS volume
After you no longer need an Amazon EBS volume, you can delete it. After deletion, its data is gone and the volume can't be attached to any instance. However, before deletion, you can store a snapshot of the volume, which you can use to re-create the volume later. 
Note
You can't delete a volume if it's attached to an instance. To delete a volume, you must first detach it. For more information, see Detaching an Amazon EBS volume from a Windows instance.
You can check if a volume is attached to an instance. In the console, on the Volumes page, you can view the state of your volumes.
If a volume is attached to an instance, it’s in the in-use state.
If a volume is detached from an instance, it’s in the available state. You can delete this volume.
