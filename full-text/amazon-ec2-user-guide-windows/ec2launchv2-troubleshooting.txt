Common troubleshooting scenarios
This section shows common troubleshooting scenarios and steps for resolution.
Topics
 Service fails to set the wallpaper
 Service fails to run user data
 Service executes a task only one time
 Service fails to run a task
Service fails to set the wallpaper
Resolution


Check that %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\setwallpaper.lnk exists.


Check %ProgramData%\Amazon\EC2Launch\log\agent.log to see if any errors occurred.


Service fails to run user data
Possible cause: Service may have failed before running user data.
Resolution


Check %ProgramData%\Amazon\EC2Launch\state\previous-state.json.


See if boot, network, preReady, and postReadyLocalData have all been marked as success.


If one of the stages failed, check %ProgramData%\Amazon\EC2Launch\log\agent.log for specific errors.


Service executes a task only one time
Resolution


Check the frequency of the task.


If the service already ran after Sysprep, and the task frequency is set to once, the task will not run again.


Set the frequency of the task to always if you want it to run the task every time EC2Launch v2 runs.


Service fails to run a task
Resolution


Check the latest entries in %ProgramData%\Amazon\EC2Launch\log\agent.log.


If no errors occurred, try running the service manually from "%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2Launch\EC2Launch.exe" run to see if the tasks succeed.
