Migrate to EC2Launch v2
The EC2Launch migration tool includes an option to upgrade an earlier version of the service by uninstalling it and installing EC2Launch v2. If you choose that option, all of the applicable configurations from prior launch services are automatically migrated to the new service. If you are migrating from EC2Config, the AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) is uninstalled when EC2Config is uninstalled. The EC2Launch v2 upgrade reinstalls a stable version of the SSM Agent. We recommend that you update the SSM Agent to the latest version using your preferred change control process.
You can download the migration tool or install with an SSM RunCommand document. 
You can download the tool from the following locations:
Note
You must run the EC2Launch v2 migration tool as an Administrator.
