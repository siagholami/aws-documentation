Details about AWS Windows AMI versions
What to expect in an official AWS Windows AMI
AWS provides AMIs with a variety of configurations for all supported Windows Operating System versions. For each of these images, AWS:
 Installs all Microsoft recommended Windows security patches. We release images shortly after the monthly Microsoft patches are made available.
 Installs the latest drivers for AWS hardware, including network and disk drivers, EC2WinUtil for troubleshooting, as well as GPU drivers in selected AMIs.
 Includes AWS helper software, like EC2 Config for Server 2012 R2 and earlier, or EC2 Launch for Server 2016 and later.
 Configures Windows Time to use the AWS Time Service.
 Makes changes in all power schemes to set the display to never turn off.
 Performs minor bug fixes – generally one-line registry changes to enable or disable features that we have found to improve performance on AWS.
Other than the adjustments listed above, we keep our AMIs as close as possible to the default install. This means we default to the “stock” PowerShell or .NET framework versions, don’t install Windows Features, and generally don’t change the AMI.
How AWS decides which Windows AMIs to offer
Each AMI is extensively tested prior to release to the general public. We periodically streamline our AMI offerings to simplify customer choice and to reduce costs.
 New AMI offerings are created for new OS releases. You can count on AWS releasing “Base,” “Core/Container,” and “SQL Express/Standard/Web/Enterprise” offerings in English and other widely used languages. The primary difference between Base and Core offerings is that Base offerings have a desktop/GUI whereas Core offerings are PowerShell command line only. For more information about Windows Server Core, see  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/server-core/what-is-server-core.
 New AMI offerings are created to support new platforms – for example, the Deep Learning and “NVidia” AMIs were created to support customers using our GPU-based instance types (P2 and P3, G2 and G3, etc.).
 Less popular AMIs are sometimes removed. If we see a particular AMI is launched only a few times in its entire lifespan, we will remove it in favor of more widely used options.
If there is an AMI variant that you would like to see, let us know by filing a ticket with Cloud Support, or by providing feedback through one of our established channels.
Patches, security updates, and AMI IDs
AWS provides updated, fully-patched Windows AMIs within five business days of Microsoft's patch Tuesday (the second Tuesday of each month). The new AMIs are available immediately through the Images page in the Amazon EC2 console. The new AMIs are available in the AWS Marketplace and the Quick Start tab of the launch instance wizard within a few days of their release.
Note
Instances launched from the latest Windows Server 2019 AMIs may show a Windows Update dialog message stating "Some settings are managed by your organization." This message appears as a result of changes in Windows Server 2019 and does not impact the behavior of Windows Update or your ability to manage update settings.
To remove this warning, see "Some settings are managed by your organization".
To ensure that customers have the latest security updates by default, AWS keeps Windows AMIs available for three months. After releasing new Windows AMIs, AWS makes the Windows AMIs that are older than three months private within 10 days. After an AMI has been made private, if you look at an instance launched from that AMI in the console, the AMI ID field states, "Cannot load detail for ami-xxxxx. You may not be permitted to view it." You can still retrieve the AMI ID using the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK.
The Windows AMIs in each release have new AMI IDs. Therefore, we recommend that you write scripts that locate the latest AWS Windows AMIs by their names, rather than by their IDs. For more information, see the following examples:
 Get-EC2ImageByName (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)
 Query for the Latest Windows AMI Using Systems Manager Parameter Store
 Walkthrough: Looking Up Amazon Machine Image IDs (AWS Lambda, AWS CloudFormation)
Semiannual channel releases
AWS provides Windows Server semiannual channel releases that combine the scale, performance, and elasticity of AWS with the new capabilities in the Semiannual channel release versions of Windows Server.

A new version of Amazon Machine Images has been released. These images include EC2Launch v2 and serve as a functional preview of the new launch agent in advance of it being included by default on all Windows AMIs currently provided by AWS later this year. Note that some SSM documents and dependent services, such as EC2 Image Builder, may require updates to support EC2 Launch v2. These updates will follow in the coming weeks. These images are not recommended for use in production environments. You can read more about EC2Launch v2 at https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/07/introducing-ec2-launch-v2-simplify-customizing-windows-instances/ and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2launch-v2.html. All current Windows Server AMIs will continue to be provided without changes to the current launch agent, either EC2Config (Server 2012 RTM or 2012 R2) or EC2Launch v1 (Server 2016 or later), for the next several months. In the near future, all Windows Server AMIs currently provided by AWS will be migrated to use EC2Launch v2 by default as part of the monthly release. EC2LaunchV2_Preview AMIs will be updated monthly and remain available until this migration occurs.  [See the AWS documentation website for more details]
