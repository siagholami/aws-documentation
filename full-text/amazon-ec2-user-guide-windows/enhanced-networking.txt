Enhanced networking on Windows
Enhanced networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types. SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization when compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies. There is no additional charge for using enhanced networking.

Enhanced networking types
Depending on your instance type, enhanced networking can be enabled using one of the following mechanisms:
Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)
The Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) supports network speeds of up to 100 Gbps for supported instance types.
The current generation instances support ENA for enhanced networking, except for M4 instances smaller than m4.16xlarge.
Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) interface
The Intel 82599 Virtual Function interface supports network speeds of up to 10 Gbps for supported instance types.
The following instance types use the Intel 82599 VF interface for enhanced networking: C3, C4, D2, I2, M4 (excluding m4.16xlarge), and R3.
For information about the supported network speed for each instance type, see Amazon EC2 Instance Types.
Enabling enhanced networking on your instance
If your instance type supports the Elastic Network Adapter for enhanced networking, follow the procedures in Enabling enhanced networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on Windows instances.
If your instance type supports the Intel 82599 VF interface for enhanced networking, follow the procedures in Enabling enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 VF interface on Windows instances.
