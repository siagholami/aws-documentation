Managed AWS Windows AMIs
AWS provides managed Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that include various versions and configurations of Windows Server. In general, the AWS Windows AMIs are configured with the default settings used by the Microsoft installation media. However, there are customizations. For example, the AWS Windows AMIs come with the following software and drivers:
 EC2Config service (through Windows Server 2012 R2)
 EC2Launch (Windows Server 2016 and later)
 AWS Systems Manager
 AWS CloudFormation
 AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell
 Network drivers (SRIOV, ENA, Citrix PV)
 Storage drivers (NVMe, AWS PV, Citrix PV)
 Graphics drivers (NVidia GPU, Elastic GPU)
 Spot Instance hibernation
For information about other customizations, see Configuration changes for AWS Windows AMIs.

Updating your Windows instance
After you launch a Windows instance, you are responsible for installing updates on it. You can manually install only the updates that interest you, or you can start from a current AWS Windows AMI and build a new Windows instance. For information about finding the current AWS Windows AMIs, see Finding a Windows AMI.
Note
Instances should be stateless when updating. For more information, see Managing Your AWS Infrastructure at Scale.
For Windows instances, you can install updates to the following services or applications:
  Microsoft Windows Server 
  Microsoft SQL Server 
  Windows PowerShell 
 EC2Launch
 EC2Config service
 AWS Systems Manager SSM Agent
 ENA
 NVMe drivers
 PV drivers
 AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell
 AWS CloudFormation helper scripts
You can reboot a Windows instance after installing updates. For more information, see Reboot your instance.
Upgrading or migrating to a newer version of Windows Server
For information about how to upgrade or migrate a Windows instance to a newer version of Windows Server, see Upgrading an Amazon EC2 Windows instance to a newer version of Windows Server.
Subscribing to Windows AMI notifications
To be notified when new AMIs are released or when previously released AMIs are made private, subscribe for notifications using Amazon SNS.
To subscribe to Windows AMI notifications


Open the Amazon SNS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home.


In the navigation bar, change the Region to US East (N. Virginia), if necessary. You must use this Region because the SNS notifications that you are subscribing to were created in this Region.


In the navigation pane, choose Subscriptions.


Choose Create subscription.


For the Create subscription dialog box, do the following:


For Topic ARN, copy and paste one of the following Amazon Resource Names (ARNs):

arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:801119661308:ec2-windows-ami-update
arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:801119661308:ec2-windows-ami-private

For AWS GovCloud (US):
arn:aws-us-gov:sns:us-gov-west-1:077303321853:ec2-windows-ami-update 


For Protocol, choose Email.


For Endpoint, type an email address that you can use to receive the notifications.


Choose Create subscription.


You'll receive a confirmation email with the subject line AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation. Open the email and choose Confirm subscription to complete your subscription.


Whenever Windows AMIs are released, we send notifications to the subscribers of the ec2-windows-ami-update topic. Whenever released Windows AMIs are made private, we send notifications to the subscribers of the ec2-windows-ami-private topic. If you no longer want to receive these notifications, use the following procedure to unsubscribe.
To unsubscribe from Windows AMI notifications


Open the Amazon SNS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home.


In the navigation bar, change the Region to US East (N. Virginia), if necessary. You must use this Region because the SNS notifications were created in this Region.

Changes in Windows Server 2016 and later AMIs
AWS provides AMIs for Windows Server 2016 and later. These AMIs include the following high-level changes from earlier Windows AMIs:
 To accommodate the change from .NET Framework to .NET Core, the EC2Config service has been deprecated on Windows Server 2016 AMIs and replaced by EC2Launch. EC2Launch is a bundle of Windows PowerShell scripts that perform many of the tasks performed by the EC2Config service. For more information, see Configuring a Windows instance using EC2Launch. 
 On earlier versions of Windows Server AMIs, you can use the EC2Config service to join an EC2 instance to a domain and configure integration with Amazon CloudWatch. On Windows Server 2016 and later AMIs, you can use the CloudWatch agent to configure integration with Amazon CloudWatch. For more information about configuring instances to send log data to CloudWatch, see Collect Metrics and Logs from Amazon EC2 Instances and On-Premises Servers with the CloudWatch Agent. For information about joining an EC2 instance to a domain, see  Join an Instance to a Domain Using the AWS-JoinDirectoryServiceDomain JSON Document in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
Other Differences
Note these additional important differences for instances created from Windows Server 2016 and later AMIs.
 By default, EC2Launch does not initialize secondary EBS volumes. You can configure EC2Launch to initialize disks automatically by either scheduling the script to run or by calling EC2Launch in user data. For the procedure to initialize disks using EC2Launch, see "Initialize Drives and Drive Letter Mappings" in Configuring EC2Launch.
 If you previously enabled CloudWatch integration on your instances by using a local configuration file (AWS.EC2.Windows.CloudWatch.json), you can configure the file to work with the SSM Agent on instances created from Windows Server 2016 and later AMIs.
For more information, see Windows Server 2019 on Microsoft.com.
Docker container conflict on Windows Server 2016 instances
If you run the Docker service on Windows Server 2016 AMIs, the service is configured to use a different CIDR value than the default internal IP address prefix value. The default value is 172.16.0.0/12. Windows Server 2016 AMIs use 172.17.0.0/16 to avoid a conflict with the default Amazon EC2 VPC/subnet. If you don't change VPC/subnet settings for your EC2 instances, then you don't need to do anything. The conflict is essentially avoided because of the different CIDR values. If you do change VPC/subnet settings, be aware of these internal IP address prefix values and avoid creating a conflict. For more information, read the following section.
Important
If you plan to run Docker on a Windows Server 2016 instance, you must create the instance from the following Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or an AMI based on an image with Windows_Server-2016-English-Full-Containers in the name. Otherwise, if you use a different Windows Server 2016 AMI, instances fail to boot correctly after installing Docker and then running Sysprep.
Issue with the Hibernate Agent (2018.03.16 AMIs)
After the release of the 2018.03.16 Windows AMIs, we discovered an unquoted path in the configuration of the Amazon EC2 Hibernate Agent. The agent was included in the AMIs for Windows Server 2008 through Windows Server 2016. This issue does not impact the AMIs for Windows Server 2003.
AWS has removed the Windows AMIs dated 2018.03.16. To be notified when new Windows AMIs are available, see Subscribing to Windows AMI notifications.
To mitigate the issue, you can use one of the following procedures to add the missing quotation marks. If the agent is running, you must also restart the agent. Alternatively, you can terminate any instances that you launched from a 2018.03.16 Windows AMI and replace them with instances launched using a different AMI.
Windows PowerShell


On your Windows instance, open Windows Powershell.


Use the following command to update the configuration, adding the missing quotation marks:


cmd /c 'sc config EC2HibernateAgent binPath="\"%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\Hibernate\EC2HibernateAgent.exe\""'

Use the following command to view the updated configuration:

(Get-ItemProperty -Path Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EC2HibernateAgent\).ImagePath
Verify that the response is enclosed in quotation marks, as shown in the following example:
"C:\Program Files\Amazon\Hibernate\EC2HibernateAgent.exe"

Use the following command to check whether Status is Running:

Get-Service EC2HibernateAgent
If the agent is running, you must restart it using the following command so that the change takes effect:
Restart-Service EC2HibernateAgent
Command Prompt


On your Windows instance, open a Command Prompt window.


Use the following command to update the configuration, adding the missing quotation marks:


sc config EC2HibernateAgent binPath="\"%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\Hibernate\EC2HibernateAgent.exe\""

Use the following command to view the updated configuration:

sc qc EC2HibernateAgent
Verify that the path in BINARY_PATH_NAME is enclosed in quotation marks, as shown in the following example:
"C:\Program Files\Amazon\Hibernate\EC2HibernateAgent.exe"

Use the following command to check whether STATE is RUNNING:

sc query EC2HibernateAgent
If the agent is running, you must restart it using the following command so that the change takes effect:
sc stop EC2HibernateAgent && sc start EC2HibernateAgent
