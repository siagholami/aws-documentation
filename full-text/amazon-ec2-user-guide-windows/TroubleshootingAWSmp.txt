General Troubleshooting for System Center 2012 — Operations Manager
Try the following to resolve any issues.
 Verify that you have installed the latest Update Rollup for System Center 2012 — Operations Manager. The AWS Management Pack requires at least Update Rollup 1.
 Ensure that you have configured the AWS Management Pack after importing it by running the Add Monitoring Wizard. For more information, see Step 1: Installing the AWS Management Pack.
 Verify that you have waited long enough for the AWS resources to be discovered (10–20 minutes).
 Verify that the management servers are configured properly.
   Management servers must have Internet connectivity.
   The action account for a management server must have local administrator privileges on the management server.
   The management server must have the .NET Framework 4.5. or later.
 Verify that the AWS Run As account is valid.
   The values for the access key ID and secret access key are correct.
   The access keys are active: In the AWS Management Console, click your name in the navigation bar and then click Security Credentials.
   The IAM user has at least read-only access permission. Note that read-only access allows the user actions that do not change the state of a resource, such as monitoring, but do not allow the user actions like launching or stopping an instance.
     If an Amazon CloudWatch metric shows as Not Monitored, check whether at least one Amazon CloudWatch alarm has been defined for that Amazon CloudWatch metric.
     For further troubleshooting, use the information in the event logs.
     Check the Operations Manager event log on the management server. For more information, see Events for a list of the events that the AWS Management Pack writes to the Operations Manager event log.
