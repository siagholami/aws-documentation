Managing Administrators
We recommend that you select several users to administer the management portal. To add an administrator for the management portal, you must be an administrator for both vCenter and the management portal.
To add an administrator


Sign in to vCenter as an administrator, click Home, and then click AWS Management Portal.


From the top pane, click Admin Users.


Click Add.
Tip
If you are using the connector to authenticate users and it is in maintenance mode, you'll receive the error "Unable to contact User Provider. Please contact your Administrator." We recommend that you wait a few minutes and then try again.


In the Select Users dialog box, select the domain and one or more users, and then click OK.


Note that domains and users are disabled if their names don't meet certain requirements. If a user is a domain user, domain\user must not exceed 32 characters. If a user is a local user, user must not exceed 32 characters. The domain and user values must each begin with a letter and contain only the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, periods (.), underscores (_), and dashes (-). 

When you are finished adding administrators, click Save.

To remove an administrator for the management portal, you must be an administrator for the management portal.
To remove an administrator


Sign in to vCenter as an administrator, click Home, and then click AWS Management Portal.


Click Admin Users.


Select the user from the list.


Click Remove, and then click Save.


Managing VPCs and Subnets
By default, you can create up to five VPCs per region. You can create one or more subnets per VPC and one or more security groups per VPC. To configure route tables, network ACLs, and other advanced VPC features, you must use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. For more information about VPCs, see the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Note that each region might also have a default VPC, depending on when you created your AWS account.
To create a VPC and subnets


Sign in to vCenter as an administrator, click Home, and then click AWS Management Portal.


From the top pane, click VPC.


Select a region for the VPC. On the Getting Started tab, click Create a virtual private cloud.


Enter a name for the VPC in VPC Name.


Select the configuration that meets your needs, VPC with a single public subnet or VPC with public and private subnets, and then click Next.


Note that you can add additional subnets after you create the VPC. Also, the Amazon VPC console supports additional configurations for your VPC.


Enter an IP address range for the VPC, in CIDR notation (for example, 10.0.0.0/16).


For each subnet, enter an IP address range, in CIDR notation (for example, 10.0.0.0/24), and select an Availability Zone. Note that if you create multiple subnets in a VPC, the IP address ranges for the subnets must not overlap. When you are finished, click Next.


(Optional) Specify one or more tags for your VPC. For each tag, click Add, enter the tag key, and enter the tag value.


When you are finished adding tags, click Finish.


(Optional) To add another subnet to your VPC, select the VPC, and then click Create a subnet on the Getting Started tab. Enter a name, select an Availability Zone, and enter an IP address range for the subnet, in CIDR notation. By default, the subnet is a public subnet. To create a private subnet, click Make this a private subnet. You can also specify one or more tags for the subnet. When you are finished, click Finish.


You can delete a nondefault VPC only if there are no running instances in its subnets. You can't delete a default VPC using the management portal.
To delete a VPC


Sign in to vCenter as an administrator, click Home, and then click AWS Management Portal.


Click VPC.


Expand the region for the VPC, and then select the VPC.


On the Getting Started tab, click Delete the virtual private cloud.


In the Delete VPC dialog box, click Yes.


Managing Security Groups
A security group acts as a firewall that controls the traffic for one of more EC2 instances. You'll create a security group and add rules that allow users to connect to EC2 instances in the VPC associated with the security group. Users select one or more security groups when they create a template.
To create a security group


Sign in to vCenter as an administrator, click Home, and then click AWS Management Portal.


From the top pane, click VPC.


Expand the region for the VPC, and then select the VPC.


On the Getting Started tab, click Create a security group.


Enter a name and a description for the security group, and then click Next.


To connect to an EC2 Linux instance, you must add a rule that allows inbound traffic using SSH. (Note that you can skip this step and add the rule later by selecting the security group and clicking Add a rule on the Getting Started tab.)


Click Add.


From the Type list, select SSH.


From the Source list, select Custom IP.


Enter the IP address range in IP, in CIDR notation. For example, if your IP address is 203.0.113.25, specify 203.0.113.25/32 to list this single IP address in CIDR notation. If your company allocates addresses from a range, specify the entire range, such as 203.0.113.0/24.


Verify that Inbound is selected.


Click Add.


To connect to an EC2 Windows instance, you must add a rule that allows inbound traffic using RDP. (Note that you can skip this step and add the rule later by selecting the security group and clicking Add a rule on the Getting Started tab.)


Click Add.


From the Type list, select RDP.


From the Source list, select Custom IP.


Enter the IP address range in IP, in CIDR notation. For example, if your IP address is 203.0.113.25, specify 203.0.113.25/32 to list this single IP address in CIDR notation. If your company allocates addresses from a range, specify the entire range, such as 203.0.113.0/24.


Verify that Inbound is selected.


Click Add.


When you are finished adding rules, click Next.


(Optional) Specify one or more tags for your security group. For each tag, click Add, enter the tag key, and enter the tag value. When you are finished entering tags, click Next.


Review the properties for your security group. To make changes, click Back. When you are ready to create the security group, click Finish.


You can delete a security group only if it's not currently associated with an instance.
To delete a security group


Sign in to vCenter as an administrator, click Home, and then click AWS Management Portal.


Click VPC.


Expand the region and the VPC for the security group, and then select the security group.


On the Getting Started tab, click Delete the security group.


In the Delete Security Group dialog box, click Yes.


To change the security groups for a running instance, you must use the Amazon EC2 console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see Security Groups for Your VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Managing Environments
Administrators use environments to organize and manage AWS resources. They grant permissions to users at the environment level.
As an administrator, you can create environments, and you have access to default environments. The default environment for a region enables you to manage EC2 instances that were created for your AWS account in that region using tools such as the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK, instead of using the management portal.
To create an environment


Sign in to vCenter as an administrator, click Home, and then click AWS Management Portal.


From the top pane, click Dashboard.


Select a region for the environment. On the Getting Started page, click Create an environment.


Enter a name for the environment in Name.


Select a VPC from VPC. Note that this list includes all VPCs for the region, including VPCs created using the Amazon VPC console and the default VPC (if it exists). If this list is empty, you must create a VPC in this region.


Select one or more subnets from Subnets. Note that this list includes all subnets for the selected VPC, including any default subnets. If this list is empty, you must add a subnet to the VPC or select a different VPC.


Click Finish.


After you create an environment, you create one or more templates and use these templates to launch EC2 instances into your environment. For more information, see Managing EC2 Instances Using AWS Management Portal for vCenter. When you launch an instance, we add a tag with the name aws-management-portal/environment-id and the value set to the ID of the environment. You can use this tag to track resources using detailed billing reports or EC2 usage reports. Users can't modify this tag using the management portal. However, users may have access to modify or delete this tag using the Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API. If someone modifies or deletes this tag, it can affect users' permissions to access the instance. Therefore, we recommend that you limit the users who can create, modify, or delete tags.
You can delete an environment only after you've deleted its templates.
To delete an environment


Sign in to vCenter as an administrator, click Home, and then click AWS Management Portal.


Click Dashboard.


Expand the region for the environment, and then select the environment.


Right-click the environment and select Delete.


In the Delete Environment dialog box, click Yes.


Administrators can describe, start, stop, reboot, and terminate EC2 instances in the default environment for a region using the management portal.
To manage instances in the default environment


Sign in to vCenter as an administrator, click Home, and then click AWS Management Portal.


Click Dashboard and expand the region.


To list your instances, do one of the following:
    Expand Default Environment.
    Click Default Environment and then click the Instances tab.


To start, stop, reboot, or terminate an instance, expand Default Environment and select the instance. From the Getting Started tab, click the desired task under Basic Tasks.


Managing User Permissions
Administrators can manage users' permissions to access an environment. To grant permissions, you must be an administrator for both vCenter and the management portal. To edit or delete permissions, you must be an administrator for the management portal.
The specific permissions granted to a user depend on the role that you assign to the user. The management portal defines the following roles:
No-Access
No permissions.
Read-Only
Permissions to view the environment, including its templates and instances.
General
Includes permissions from Read-Only, plus permissions to run, rename, reboot, stop, start, terminate, and import instances.
Owner
Includes permissions from General, plus permissions to create, delete, and rename templates, to import and delete key pairs, and to create images.
To grant permissions to a user


Sign in to vCenter as an administrator, click Home, and then click AWS Management Portal.


From the top pane, click Dashboard.


Expand the region for the environment, right-click the environment, and then click Add Permission.


Click Add. In the Select Users dialog box, select the domain and one or more users, and then click OK.


Note that domains and users are disabled if their names don't meet certain requirements. If a user is a domain user, domain\user must not exceed 32 characters. If a user is a local user, user must not exceed 32 characters. The domain and user values must each begin with a letter and contain only the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, periods (.), underscores (_), and dashes (-). Capitalization of domain and user should match that of the vCenter user.
