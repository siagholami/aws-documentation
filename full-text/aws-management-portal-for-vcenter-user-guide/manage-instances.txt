Managing EC2 Instances Using AWS Management Portal for vCenter
You can launch an EC2 instance using the management portal. First, create a template from an environment set up by an administrator, then deploy the instance from the template. You can view, stop, start, and terminate the instance. Note that your ability to complete these tasks depends on the permissions granted to you by your administrator.

Viewing Regions
The first time that you log in to the management portal, you are asked to select the regions to display in the dashboard. You can update the regions displayed in the dashboard at any time. For example, if you don't have AWS resources in some regions, you can exclude them from the dashboard. If later on you need to create resources in a region that's not displayed, you can include it in the dashboard.
To select the regions to display


From the menu in the upper-right corner, select Region Preferences.


Choose the regions to display.


Click Save.


Viewing an Environment
Your AWS resources are organized and managed using environments. The permissions that you've been granted by your administrator determine whether you can view an environment, along with its templates and instances. 
To view an environment


From vCenter, click Home and then click AWS Management Portal.


From the dashboard, expand the region for the environment, and then select the environment.


To display information about the environment, click the Summary tab.


To list the instances deployed using the templates of this environment, click the Instances tab.


Managing Key Pairs
Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information for your instance. Public-key cryptography uses a public key to encrypt a piece of data, such as a password, then the recipient uses the private key to decrypt the data. The public and private keys are known as a key pair.
To connect to your instance, you must create a key pair, import the public key to the environment for the instance, and select it when you create the template from which you'll deploy the instance. You'll use the private key when you connect to the instance that you launch using this template.
The permissions that you've been granted by your administrator determine whether you can import a key pair.
To import a key pair


Create an RSA key pair using a tool like ssh-keygen. Save the public key to a local file, and the private key to a different local file with the .pem extension. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Key Pairs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.


From vCenter, click Home and then click AWS Management Portal.


From the dashboard, expand the region for the environment, and then select the environment.


Click the Key Pairs tab.


Right-click in the unused space in the tab and select Import Key Pair.


In the Import Key Pair dialog box, click Browse. Select the public key file that you created in step 1 and then click Import.


When you no longer need to deploy instances using a key pair, or if you lose the private key, you can delete the public key that you imported. The permissions that you've been granted by your administrator determine whether you can delete a key pair.
To delete a key pair


From vCenter, click Home and then click AWS Management Portal.


From the dashboard, expand the region for the environment, and then select the environment.


Click the Key Pairs tab.


Right-click the key pair and select Delete Key Pair.


When prompted to confirm, click Yes.


Managing Templates
A template specifies the information that Amazon EC2 requires when configuring an instance. The permissions that you've been granted by your administrator determine whether you can create a template.
To create a template


From vCenter, click Home and then click AWS Management Portal.


From the dashboard, expand a region for the template, and then select the environment for the template.


On the Getting Started tab, click Create a template. If this task isn't listed, your administrator didn't grant you permission to create templates in this environment.
