 Uninstalling the Connector
Note that the procedures on this page are written for version 2.1.0 and later of the connector. If the version information in the upper-right corner of the connector management console is Version: 2.0.0, download the PDF file Managing the Connector for directions written for version 2.0.0 of the connector.
Accessing the Management Console
To access the management console, go to https://ip_address/, where ip_address is the IP address of the connector management console that you saved when you deployed the connector virtual appliance.
Logging into the Virtual Machine Console
You can use the connector CLI from the connector virtual machine console. To access the virtual machine console, locate the connector VM in the vSphere client, right-click it, and select Open Console.
The default user is ec2-user and the default password is ec2pass.
We recommend that you change the password after you have logged in. To change the password, use the following command:
passwd new_password
Important
Note that if you use the command sudo passwd it will modify the password for root, not the password for ec2-user.
Resetting the Connector Password
If you forget the password that you use to log in to the connector setup console, you can reset the password using the connector CLI.
To reset your password using the connector CLI


Locate the connector VM in the vSphere client, right-click it, and select Open Console.


Log in as ec2-user. For more information, see Logging into the Virtual Machine Console.


Run the sudo setup.rb command. This command displays the following menu:


Choose one of the following options
   1. Reset password
   2. Reconfigure network settings
   3. Restart services
   4. Factory reset
   5. Delete unused upgrade-related files
   6. Enable/disable SSL certificate validation
   7. Display connector's SSL certificate
   8. Generate log bundle
   9. Exit
   Please enter your option [1-9]:

Type 1, and then press Enter. Follow the onscreen directions. Note that in general, you should not change the vCenter IP/hostname, you should use the same vCenter to authenticate.

Rotating the Keys
We recommend that you rotate these keys periodically.
The AMP-connector key is shared between the management console and the on-premises connector and is used to establish trust between these entities.
To rotate the AMP-connector key


Open the AWS Management Portal for vCenter setup console.


On the AWS Management Portal Setup page, expand the AMP-Connector Key pane and then click Edit.


On the Create an AMP-Connector Key page, select Create a new AMP-Connector key.


Enter a name for the key and then click Create.


On the Review Your Configuration page, click Download Configuration. Save this file to a safe location. You'll need it to complete the connector deployment process.


Click Finish.


The connector encryption key is used to encrypt sensitive information (such as account credentials) that is local to the connector.
To rotate the connector encryption key


Using a web browser, open the connector management console.


From the connector management console, click Rotate encryption key.


In the Rotate encryption key dialog box, enter a password for the connector and then click Rotate.

If you need to troubleshoot issues with the connector, you can download the debug log files as follows:


Using a web browser, open the connector management console.


From the dashboard, click Download Debug Log Bundle.


Download and review the log files.


If AWS Management Portal for vCenter is not showing up in vSphere Web Client


Log out of vSphere Web Client and then log back in.


If the management portal is still not showing up, re-register the connector as follows:


Using a web browser, open the connector management console.


From the dashboard, click Register the Connector.


Follow the directions to complete the registration wizard.


Log out of vSphere Web Client and then log back in.


If the management portal is still not showing up, restart the service for the connector, as described in the procedure for "If the connector isn't responding" below, and then re-register the connector as described in the previous step.


If the connector isn't responding


You can restart the services for the connector using the connector CLI as follows:


Locate the connector VM in the vSphere client, right-click it, and select Open Console.


Log in as ec2-user. For more information, see Logging into the Virtual Machine Console.

  8. Generate log bundle
  9. Exit
  Please enter your option [1-9]:


Type 4, and then press Enter. Follow the onscreen directions.


After the factory reset is complete, it's as if you have just downloaded the OVA file and installed it. You must configure the connector again. For more information, see Configuring the Connector.


Troubleshooting Upgrades
If an error occurs during an upgrade


From the management console, check whether there are any failures in the Health Status pane. If there is a failure, attempt to resolve the issue. For more information, see Monitoring the Connector.


Refresh the page and retry the upgrade.


If the error persists, send debug logs to AWS. For more information, see Reporting a Problem to AWS.


If an upgrade continues for a long time
If you have launched a manual upgrade of connector version 2.4.x from the management console, the upgrade process can take a long time to finish. This is because we are making security upgrades to the connector.


If the upgrade is still in progress after 20 minutes, refresh your browser. If the page is down, the upgrade process might not have finished; try refreshing again after another 10 minutes.


When prompted by your browser, accept the new certificates for connector.


Log in to the connector.


If the connector is unresponsive after an upgrade


If the connector is still unresponsive after 30 minutes, reboot the connector appliance.


If the connector remains unresponsive, contact AWS Support for further assistance.


Installing a Trusted SSL Certificate
The first time that you power on the connector appliance, it automatically generates a self-signed certificate based on its IP address. Because this is a self-signed certificate, your web browser notifies you that it is an untrusted certificate the first time you visit the connector management console. We recommend that you validate this certificate before you trust it, and then replace the certificate by installing an SSL certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) on your connector, as shown in the following procedure. After you do so, you will make subsequent connections to the connector using the new certificate.
To install an SSL certificate on your connector


Before uploading a trusted certificate to the connector, we recommend that you ensure that communication between your computer and the connector over the network is secure. For more information, see Validating an Untrusted SSL Certificate.


Create a private key and obtain a corresponding trusted certificate in PEM format. The recommended way to do this is as follows:


Create the private key and certificate signing request (CSR) using tools such as the openssl tools. You must specify the IP address of the connector. If you've set up a DNS hostname that resolves to the IP address of the connector, you must also specify the DNS hostname of the connector.


Submit the CSR to your CA.


Wait for the CA to send you the trusted certificate.


Package the private key and trusted certificate into a PKCS#12 file with a passphrase as follows:


openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey my-private-key.pem -in my-certificate.pem -out my-passphrase.p12 -passout pass:passphrase


Open the management console.


In the Actions pane, click Upload security certificate.


In the Upload Security Certificate dialog box, click Choose file and select your PKCS 12 file. Enter the passphrase and then click Upload.


Each SSL certificate has a validity period. You must replace a certificate before its validity period ends. To replace a certificate, you must create and upload a new certificate.
Validating an Untrusted SSL Certificate
The first time that you power on the connector appliance, it automatically generates a self-signed certificate based on its IP address. The connector presents your browser with this certificate to identify itself and encrypt the connection. This certificate helps your browser determine whether this site is actually the site that it claims to be. Because this is a self-signed certificate, your web browser notifies you that it is an untrusted certificate the first time you visit the connector management console. (Check the error message in your browser for details.) We recommend that you validate this certificate before you trust it.
If the IP address shown in the SSL certificate for the connector is different than the current IP address of the connector, you should restart the services on the connector, which regenerates the certificate using the current IP address. For more information, see Restart Services.
You can validate the untrusted certificate by viewing the certificate details as follows, and comparing them against the untrusted certificate.
To view the connector certificate


Locate the connector VM in the vSphere client, right-click it, and select Open Console.


Log in as ec2-user. For more information, see Logging into the Virtual Machine Console.


Run the sudo setup.rb command. This command displays the following menu:


Choose one of the following options
   1. Reset password
   2. Reconfigure network settings
   3. Restart services
   4. Factory reset
   5. Delete unused upgrade-related files
   6. Enable/disable SSL certificate validation
   7. Display connector's SSL certificate
   8. Generate log bundle
   9. Exit
   Please enter your option [1-9]:

Type 7, and then press Enter.

Uninstalling the Connector
If you need to uninstall the connector, complete the following steps.
To uninstall the connector
