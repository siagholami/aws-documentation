AWS Trusted Advisor
AWS Trusted Advisor draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers. Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment, and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps. All AWS customers have access to five Trusted Advisor checks. Customers with a Business or Enterprise support plan can view all Trusted Advisor checks. For more information, see AWS Trusted Advisor.
For information about using Amazon CloudWatch Events to monitor the status of Trusted Advisor checks, see Monitoring Trusted Advisor check results with Amazon CloudWatch Events. 
You can access Trusted Advisor in the AWS Management Console. For more information about controlling access to the Trusted Advisor console, see Manage access for AWS Trusted Advisor.
Programmatic access to Trusted Advisor is available with the AWS Support API.
