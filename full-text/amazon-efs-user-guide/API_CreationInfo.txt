CreationInfo
Required if the RootDirectory > Path specified does not exist. Specifies the POSIX IDs and permissions to apply to the access point's RootDirectory > Path. If the access point root directory does not exist, EFS creates it with these settings when a client connects to the access point. When specifying CreationInfo, you must include values for all properties. 
Important
If you do not provide CreationInfo and the specified RootDirectory does not exist, attempts to mount the file system using the access point will fail.
