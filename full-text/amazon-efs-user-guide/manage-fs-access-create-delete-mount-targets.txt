Creating or deleting mount targets in a VPC
To access an Amazon EFS file system in a VPC, you need mount targets. For an Amazon EFS file system, the following is true:
 You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone. 
 If the VPC has multiple subnets in an Availability Zone, you can create a mount target in only one of those subnets. All EC2 instances in the Availability Zone can share the single mount target. 
Note
We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones. There are cost considerations for mounting a file system on an EC2 instance in an Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability Zone. For more information, see Amazon EFS. In addition, by always using a mount target local to the instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial failure scenario. If the mount target's zone goes down, you can't access your file system through that mount target. 
For more information about the operation, see CreateMountTarget.
You can delete mount targets. A mount target deletion forcibly breaks any mounts of the file system via that mount target, which might disrupt instances or applications using those mounts. For more information, see DeleteMountTarget.
Note
Before deleting a mount target, first unmount the file system.
Using the AWS Management Console, you can manage mount targets on file systems. For existing mount targets, you can add and remove security groups, or delete the mount target. You can also create mount targets. For more information, see Creating mount targets.
To manage your file system mount targets using the AWS CLI, see Managing mount targets using the AWS CLI.
