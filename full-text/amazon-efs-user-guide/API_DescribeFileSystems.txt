DescribeFileSystems
Returns the description of a specific Amazon EFS file system if either the file system CreationToken or the FileSystemId is provided. Otherwise, it returns descriptions of all file systems owned by the caller's AWS account in the AWS Region of the endpoint that you're calling.
When retrieving all file system descriptions, you can optionally specify the MaxItems parameter to limit the number of descriptions in a response. Currently, this number is automatically set to 10. If more file system descriptions remain, Amazon EFS returns a NextMarker, an opaque token, in the response. In this case, you should send a subsequent request with the Marker request parameter set to the value of NextMarker. 
To retrieve a list of your file system descriptions, this operation is used in an iterative process, where DescribeFileSystems is called first without the Marker and then the operation continues to call it with the Marker parameter set to the value of the NextMarker from the previous response until the response has no NextMarker. 
The order of file systems returned in the response of one DescribeFileSystems call and the order of file systems returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified. 
This operation requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems action. 
Request Syntax
GET /2015-02-01/file-systems?CreationToken=CreationToken&FileSystemId=FileSystemId&Marker=Marker&MaxItems=MaxItems HTTP/1.1
URI Request Parameters
The request uses the following URI parameters.
 CreationToken  
(Optional) Restricts the list to the file system with this creation token (String). You specify a creation token when you create an Amazon EFS file system.
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
Pattern: . 
 FileSystemId  
(Optional) ID of the file system whose description you want to retrieve (String).
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 128.
Pattern: ^(arn:aws[-a-z]*:elasticfilesystem:[0-9a-z-:]:file-system/fs-[0-9a-f]{8,40}|fs-[0-9a-f]{8,40})$ 
 Marker  
(Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a previous DescribeFileSystems operation (String). If present, specifies to continue the list from where the returning call had left off. 
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.
Pattern: . 
 MaxItems  
(Optional) Specifies the maximum number of file systems to return in the response (integer). This number is automatically set to 100. The response is paginated at 100 per page if you have more than 100 file systems. 
Valid Range: Minimum value of 1.
Request Body
The request does not have a request body.

Example
Retrieve a List of 10 File Systems
The following example sends a GET request to the file-systems endpoint (elasticfilesystem.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2015-02-01/file-systems). The request specifies a MaxItems query parameter to limit the number of file system descriptions to 10.
