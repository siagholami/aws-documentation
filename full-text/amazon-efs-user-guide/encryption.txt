Data Encryption in EFS
Amazon EFS supports two forms of encryption for file systems, encryption of data in transit and encryption at rest. You can enable encryption of data at rest when creating an Amazon EFS file system. You can enable encryption of data in transit when you mount the file system.
When to Use Encryption
If your organization is subject to corporate or regulatory policies that require encryption of data and metadata at rest, we recommend creating an encrypted file system mounting your file system using encryption of data in transit.
