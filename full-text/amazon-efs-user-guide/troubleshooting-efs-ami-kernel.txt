Unable to chown
You're unable to change the ownership of a file/directory using the Linux chown command.
Kernel Versions with This Bug
2.6.32
Action to Take
You can resolve this error by doing the following: 
 If you're performing chown for the one-time setup step necessary to change ownership of the EFS root directory, you can run the chown command from an instance running a newer kernel. For example, use the newest version of Amazon Linux.
 If chown is part of your production workflow, you must update the kernel version to use chown.

Kernel Versions with This Bug
 CentOS-7 with kernel Linux 3.10.0-229.20.1.el7.x86_64
 Ubuntu 15.10 with kernel Linux 4.2.0-18-generic
Action to Take
Do one of the following:
 Upgrade to a newer kernel version. For CentOS-7, kernel version Linux 3.10.0-327 or later contains the fix.
 Downgrade to an older kernel version.
Listing Files in a Large Directory Takes a Long Time
This can happen if the directory is changing while your NFS client iterates through the directory to finish the list operation. Whenever the NFS client notices that the contents of the directory changed during this iteration, the NFS client restarts iterating from the beginning. As a result, the ls command can take a long time to complete for a large directory with frequently changing files.
Kernel Versions with This Bug
CentOS and RHEL kernel versions lower than 2.6.32-696.el6
Action to Take
To resolve this issue, upgrade to a newer kernel version.
