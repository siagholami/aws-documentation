PutLifecycleConfiguration
Enables lifecycle management by creating a new LifecycleConfiguration object. A LifecycleConfiguration object defines when files in an Amazon EFS file system are automatically transitioned to the lower-cost EFS Infrequent Access (IA) storage class. A LifecycleConfiguration applies to all files in a file system.
Each Amazon EFS file system supports one lifecycle configuration, which applies to all files in the file system. If a LifecycleConfiguration object already exists for the specified file system, a PutLifecycleConfiguration call modifies the existing configuration. A PutLifecycleConfiguration call with an empty LifecyclePolicies array in the request body deletes any existing LifecycleConfiguration and disables lifecycle management.
In the request, specify the following: 
 The ID for the file system for which you are enabling, disabling, or modifying lifecycle management.
 A LifecyclePolicies array of LifecyclePolicy objects that define when files are moved to the IA storage class. The array can contain only one LifecyclePolicy item.
This operation requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:PutLifecycleConfiguration operation.
To apply a LifecycleConfiguration object to an encrypted file system, you need the same AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) permissions as when you created the encrypted file system. 
Request Syntax
```
PUT /2015-02-01/file-systems/FileSystemId/lifecycle-configuration HTTP/1.1
Content-type: application/json
{
   "LifecyclePolicies": [ 
      { 
         "TransitionToIA": "string"
      }
   ]
}
```
URI Request Parameters
The request uses the following URI parameters.
 FileSystemId  
The ID of the file system for which you are creating the LifecycleConfiguration object (String).
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 128.
Pattern: ^(arn:aws[-a-z]*:elasticfilesystem:[0-9a-z-:]:file-system/fs-[0-9a-f]{8,40}|fs-[0-9a-f]{8,40})$ 
Required: Yes
Request Body
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 LifecyclePolicies  
An array of LifecyclePolicy objects that define the file system's LifecycleConfiguration object. A LifecycleConfiguration object tells lifecycle management when to transition files from the Standard storage class to the Infrequent Access storage class.
Type: Array of LifecyclePolicy objects
Required: Yes
Response Syntax
```
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-type: application/json
{
   "LifecyclePolicies": [

      }
   ]
}
```
Response Elements
If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.
The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.
 LifecyclePolicies  
An array of lifecycle management policies. Currently, EFS supports a maximum of one policy per file system.
Type: Array of LifecyclePolicy objects
Errors
BadRequest 
Returned if the request is malformed or contains an error such as an invalid parameter value or a missing required parameter.
HTTP Status Code: 400
FileSystemNotFound 
Returned if the specified FileSystemId value doesn't exist in the requester's AWS account.
HTTP Status Code: 404
IncorrectFileSystemLifeCycleState 
Returned if the file system's lifecycle state is not "available".
HTTP Status Code: 409
InternalServerError 
Returned if an error occurred on the server side.
HTTP Status Code: 500
Examples
Create a Lifecycle Configuration
The following example creates a LifecyclePolicy object using the PutLifecycleConfiguration operation. This object tells EFS lifecycle management to move all files in the file system that haven't been accessed in the last 14 days to the IA storage class. This is the only lifecycle policy that is currently supported. To learn more, see EFS Lifecycle Management.
