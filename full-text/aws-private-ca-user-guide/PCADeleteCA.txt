Deleting Your Private CA
You can delete a private CA permanently. You might want to delete one, for example, to  replace it with a new CA that has a new private key. In order to delete a CA safely, follow these steps:


Create the replacement CA.


Once the new private CA is in production, disable the old one but do not immediately delete it.


Keep the old CA disabled until all of the certificates issued by it have expired.


Delete the old CA.


ACM Private CA does not check that all of the issued certificates have expired before it processes a delete request. You can generate an audit report to determine which certificates have expired. While the CA is disabled, you can revoke certificates, but you cannot issue new ones. 
If you must delete a private CA before all the certificates it has issued have expired, we recommend that you also revoke the CA certificate. The CA certificate will be listed in the CRL of the parent CA, and the private CA will be untrusted by clients. 
Important
A private CA can be deleted if it is in the PENDING_CERTIFICATE, CREATING, EXPIRED, DISABLED, or FAILED state. In order to delete a CA in the ACTIVE state, you must first disable it, or else the delete request results in an exception. If you are deleting a private CA in the PENDING_CERTIFICATE or DISABLED state, you can set the length of its restoration period from 7 to 30 days, with 30 being the default. During this period, status is set to DELETED and the CA is restorable. A private CA that is deleted while in the CREATING or FAILED state has no assigned restoration period,and cannot be restored. For more information, see Restoring Your Private CA.
You are not charged for a private CA after it has been deleted. However, if a deleted CA is restored, you are charged for the time between deletion and restoration. For more information, see Pricing.
You can delete a private CA from the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
To delete a private CA (console)


Sign in to your AWS account and open the ACM Private CA console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/home. 


Choose Private CAs.


Choose your private CA from the list.


If your CA is in the ACTIVE state, you must disable it. On the Actions menu, choose Disable.


On the Actions menu, choose Delete.


If your CA is in the PENDING_CERTIFICATE, EXPIRED, or DISABLED state, specify a restoration period of seven to 30 days. Then choose Delete.
Note
If your private CA is not in one of these states, it can not be restored later.


If you are certain that you want to delete the private CA, choose Permanently delete when prompted. The status of the private CA changes to DELETED. However, you can restore the private CA before the end of the restoration period. To check the restoration period of a private CA in the DELETED state, call the DescribeCerticateAuthority or ListCertificateAuthorities operation.
