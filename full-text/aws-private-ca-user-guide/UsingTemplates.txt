Understanding Certificate Templates
ACM Private CA uses templates to create both CA certificates and end-entity certificates that identify users, hosts, resources, and devices. When you create a certificate in the console, a template is applied automatically. Template options are based on the type of certificate that you have chosen and the path-length that you specify. If you use the CLI or API to create a certificate, you manually provide the ARN of the template that you want to apply. (The EndEntityCertificate/V1 template is applied if you provide no ARN.)
Note
Cross-account certificate issuers are constrained by a resource-based policy and have access only to the EndEntityCertificate/V1 template.
The following links provide information about creating a certificate with ACM Private CA. 
 Using the command line: issue-certificate.
 Using the API: IssueCertificate.
The table below lists template types supported by ACM Private CA and links to their definitions.

CodeSigningCertificate/V1 Definition
This template is used to create certificates for code signing. You can use code-signing certificates from ACM Private CA with any code-signing solution that is based on a private CA infrastructure. For example, customers using Code Signing for AWS IoT can generate a code-signing certificate with ACM Private CA and import it to AWS Certificate Manager. For more information, see What Is Code Signing for AWS IoT? and Obtain and Import a Code Signing Certificate.

*CRL distribution points are included in the template only if the CA is configured with CRL generation enabled. 
RootCACertificate/V1 Definition
This template is used to issue self-signed root CA certificates. CA certificates include a critical basic constraints extension with the CA field set to TRUE to designate that the certificate can be used to issue CA certificates. This template does not specify a path length because the path length constrains the maximum length of the CA chain (CA certification depth). A constrained chain length could inhibit future expansion of the hierarchy. Extended key usage is excluded to prevent use of the CA certificate as a TLS client or server certificate. No CRL information is specified because a self-signed certificate cannot be revoked.

SubordinateCACertificate_PathLen0/V1 Definition
This template is used to issue subordinate CA certificates with a path length of 0. CA certificates include a critical basic constraints extension with the CA field set to TRUE to designate that the certificate can be used to issue CA certificates. Extended key usage is not included, which prevents the CA certificate from being used as a TLS client or server certificate.

SubordinateCACertificate_PathLen1/V1 Definition
This template is used to issue subordinate CA certificates with a path length of 1. CA certificates include a critical basic constraints extension with the CA field set to TRUE to designate that the certificate can be used to issue CA certificates. Extended key usage is not included, which prevents the CA certificate from being used as a TLS client or server certificate.

This template is used to issue subordinate CA certificates with a path length of 2. CA certificates include a critical basic constraints extension with the CA field set to TRUE to designate that the certificate can be used to issue CA certificates. Extended key usage is not included, which prevents the CA certificate from being used as a TLS client or server certificate.
