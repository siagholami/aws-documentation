Regions
Like most AWS resources, private certificate authorities (CAs) are Regional resources. To use private CAs in more than one Region, you must create your CAs in those Regions. You cannot copy private CAs between Regions. Visit AWS Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference or the AWS Region Table to see the Regional availability for ACM Private CA. 
Note
ACM is currently available in some regions that ACM Private CA is not.
