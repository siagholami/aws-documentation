Claiming Devices
The following procedure shows you how to claim one or more AWS IoT 1-Click supported devices.


Sign in to your AWS account. If you do not have an AWS account, open https://aws.amazon.com/, choose Create an AWS Account, and follow the online instructions.


From the AWS Management Console, search for "1-Click," and then choose AWS IoT 1-Click.


If you're using one or more AWS IoT Enterprise Buttons, install the AWS IoT 1-Click mobile app for iOS or Android and connect the buttons to your local Wi-Fi network. The AWS IoT 1-Click mobile app is available from the Onboard page of the AWS IoT 1-Click console. This step is not required for the LTE-M Button because it uses the cellular network.


Choose Onboard, and then choose Claim devices.


Enter one or more device IDs (such as a device serial number) or claim codes, separated by commas, and then choose Claim. If the Claim button is unavailable, double-check all the values you entered.


Press the button(s) on your device(s), and then choose Done. A list of all known devices should be displayed.
