Enable Local Printer Redirection
With local printer redirection, your AppStream 2.0 users can redirect print jobs from their streaming application to a printer that is connected to their local computer. You don't need a printer driver installed on the AppStream 2.0 streaming instance to enable users to print documents during their streaming sessions. 
Prerequisites for Local Printer Redirection
To ensure that your users can use local printer redirection, you must:
 Use an image that uses a version of the AppStream 2.0 agent released on or after July 30, 2020. For more information, see AppStream 2.0 Agent Version History.
 Ensure that your users have AppStream 2.0 client version 1.1.179 or later installed. For more information, see AppStream 2.0 Client Version History.
 Ensure printer redirection is enabled on the stack that your users access for streaming sessions.
How to Enable or Disable Local Printer Redirection
By default, local printer redirection is enabled when the AppStream 2.0 client is installed. However, if local printer redirection is not enabled on the stack that your users access for streaming sessions, perform the following steps to enable it. 
To enable local printer redirection


Open the AppStream 2.0 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2.


In the left navigation pane, choose Stacks.


Choose the stack for which you want to enable local printer redirection.


Choose the User Settings tab, and then expand the Clipboard, file transfer, and local print permissions section.


For Print to local device, verify that Enabled is selected. If not, choose Edit, and then choose Enabled.


Choose Update.


To disable local printer redirection
You can disable local printer redirection in either of the following ways:

 By using the AppStream 2.0 console or an AWS SDK to disable this option on an AppStream 2.0 stack.
