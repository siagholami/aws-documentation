Amazon AppStream 2.0 Service Quotas
By default, AWS sets quotas (also referred to as limits) for the resources that you can create and the number of users who can use the service. To request a quota increase, use the AppStream 2.0 Limits form.
The following table lists the quotas for each AppStream 2.0 resource. Where no default quota is listed for a specific instance family or instance type, the quota is 0. To determine which instance types are available in which Regions or Availability Zones, see Pricing by AWS Region â€“ Always-On, On-Demand, and image builder instances in AppStream 2.0 Pricing.
