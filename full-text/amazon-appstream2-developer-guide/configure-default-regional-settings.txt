Configure Default Regional Settings for Your AppStream 2.0 Users
In AppStream 2.0, users can configure their streaming sessions to use settings that are specific to their location or language. For more information, see Enable Your AppStream 2.0 Users to Configure Their Regional Settings. You can also configure your fleets to use default settings that are specific to your users’ location or language. In particular, you can apply the following Windows settings to your fleets:
 Time Zone — Determines the system time used by Windows and any applications that rely on the operating system time. AppStream 2.0 makes available the same options for this setting as Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019. 
 Display Language — Determines the display language used by the Windows operating system and certain Windows applications.
 System Locale — Determines the code pages (ANSI, MS-DOS, and Macintosh) and bitmap font files that Windows uses for non-Unicode applications in different languages.
 User Locale (also known as culture) — Determines the conventions used by Windows and any applications that query the Windows culture when formatting dates, numbers, or currencies or when sorting strings. 
 Input Method — Determines the keystroke combinations that can be used to enter characters in another language.
Currently, AppStream 2.0 supports English and Japanese only for these language settings.

Associate your fleet with the stack that is assigned to the users for whom you are configuring the default settings. 


The default time zone setting that you configured is applied to the fleet instances and user streaming sessions that are launched from those instances.
Note
Your users can change their time zone from the default setting that you configured. They can configure their regional settings during an application streaming session, as described in Enable Your AppStream 2.0 Users to Configure Their Regional Settings. Also, if a user previously selected a time zone when streaming from any fleet instance in the same AWS Region, the user-specified time zone setting automatically overrides any default time zone setting you specify through your image builder.
Specify a Default Display Language
There are two ways to specify the default display language for your users’ streaming sessions. Use the AppStream 2.0 default application and Windows settings feature, or configure your image builder while logged in as Administrator.
Note
Changing the display language in Windows also automatically changes the user locale and input method to match the language and region of the display language. If you want all three settings to match, you do not need to separately change the user locale or input method.
To specify a default display language by using the AppStream 2.0 default application and Windows settings feature, perform the following steps.


Open the AppStream 2.0 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2.

When prompted, log in as Administrator.


If required, configure additional default regional or language settings. Otherwise, on the image builder desktop, open Image Assistant and install and configure applications for streaming. 


In Step 2 of the Image Assistant process, choose Save settings.


Follow the necessary steps in Image Assistant to finish creating your image. For information about how to create an image, see Tutorial: Create a Custom AppStream 2.0 Image by Using the AppStream 2.0 Console.


Do one of the following:
    Create a new fleet and choose your new image for the fleet. For information, see Create an AppStream 2.0 Fleet and Stack.
    Update an existing fleet to use the new image.


Associate your fleet with the stack that is assigned to the users for whom you are configuring the default settings. 


The default display language and associated user locale and input method settings that you configured are applied to the fleet instances and user streaming sessions that are launched from those instances.
Alternatively, you can configure a default display language while logged in to the image builder as Administrator. If you chose different display languages while you were logged in under the Template User and Administrator accounts and you chose Save settings in Step 2 of the Image Assistant process, the Template User settings take precedence.
Note
Your users can change their user locale and input method from the default settings that you configured. They can change to any one of 11 different supported locales and nine different supported input methods. To do so, they can configure their regional settings during application streaming sessions, as described in Enable Your AppStream 2.0 Users to Configure Their Regional Settings. Also, if a user previously selected a user locale or input method when streaming from any fleet instance in the same Region, those user-specified settings automatically override any default user locale and input method that you specify through your image builder.

The default input method that you configured is applied to the fleet instances and user streaming sessions that are launched from those instances.
Note
Your users can change their input method from the default setting that you configured to any one of nine different supported input methods. They can configure this setting by configuring their regional settings during application streaming sessions, as described in Enable Your AppStream 2.0 Users to Configure Their Regional Settings. Also, if a user previously selected an input method when streaming from any fleet instance in the same Region, that user-specified setting automatically overrides any default input method that you specify through your image builder.
Special Considerations for Application Settings Persistence
When you create a stack in the AppStream 2.0 console, in Step 3: User Settings, if you use the same settings group under Application settings persistence as another stack that uses different regional settings, only one set of regional settings is used for both stacks. For each user, the default regional settings for the stack that the user logs into first automatically override the default regional settings of any other stacks in the same application settings group. To avoid this problem, do not use the same application settings group for two different stacks that have different regional settings.
Special Considerations for Japanese Language Settings
This section describes key points to keep in mind when configuring Japanese language settings for your AppStream 2.0 users.

AWS CLI
Changing the Windows system locale to Japanese requires that your image builder have AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) version 1.16.30 or later installed. To update the version of AWS CLI on your image builder, follow the steps in Installing the AWS Command Line Interface.
Japanese Keyboards
If your image builder input method is set to Japanese when you create an image, AppStream 2.0 automatically configures your image to use a Japanese keyboard. Any fleets that use the image are also automatically configured to use Japanese keyboards. However, if you want to use a Japanese keyboard within your image builder session, update the following registry settings for the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\i8042prt\Parameters registry key:



Name
Type
Data




LayerDriver JPN
REG_SZ
kbd106.dll


OverrideKeyboardIdentifier
REG_SZ
PCAT_106KEY


OverrideKeyboardSubtype
DWORD
2


OverrideKeyboardType
DWORD
7



After changing these settings, restart your image builder. To do so, choose the Windows Start button, and choose Windows PowerShell. In PowerShell, use the restart-computer cmdlet.
