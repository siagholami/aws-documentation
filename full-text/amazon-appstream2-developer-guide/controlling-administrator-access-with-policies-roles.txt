Using AWS Managed Policies and Linked Roles to Manage Administrator Access to AppStream 2.0 Resources
By default, IAM users don't have the permissions required to create or modify AppStream 2.0 resources, or perform tasks by using the AppStream 2.0 API. This means that these users can't perform these actions in the AppStream 2.0 console or by using AppStream 2.0 AWS CLI commands. To allow IAM users to create or modify resources and perform tasks, attach an IAM policy to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions. 
When you attach a policy to a user, group of users, or IAM role, it allows or denies the users permission to perform the specified tasks on the specified resources.
