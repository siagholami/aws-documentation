Enable and Administer Home Folders for Your AppStream 2.0 Users
AppStream 2.0 supports the following persistent storage options for users in your organization: 
 Home folders
 Google Drive for G Suite
 OneDrive for Business
You can enable one or more options for your organization. When you enable home folders for an AppStream 2.0 stack, users of the stack can access a persistent storage folder during their application streaming sessions. No further conÔ¨Åguration is required for your users to access their home folder. Data stored by users in their home folder is automatically backed up to an Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket in your AWS account and is made available to those users in subsequent sessions. 
Files and folders are encrypted in transit using Amazon S3's SSL endpoints. Files and folders are encrypted at rest using Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. 
Note
Home folders are stored on fleet instances in the following default locations:
Non-domain-joined instances: C:\Users\PhotonUser\My Files\Home Folder
Domain-joined instances: C:\Users\%username%\My Files\Home Folder
As an administrator, use the applicable path if you configure your applications to save to the home folder. In some cases, your users may not be able to find their home folder because some applications do not recognize the redirect that displays the home folder as a top-level folder in File Explorer. If this is the case, your users can access their home folder by browsing to the same directory in File Explorer.

Enable Home Folders for Your AppStream 2.0 Users
Before enabling home folders, you must do the following:
 Check that you have the correct AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions for Amazon S3 actions. For more information, see Using IAM Policies to Manage Administrator Access to the Amazon S3 Bucket for Home Folders and Application Settings Persistence.
 Use an image that was created from an AWS base image released on or after May 18, 2017. For a current list of released AWS images, see AppStream 2.0 Base Image Version History.
 Enable network connectivity to Amazon S3 from your virtual private cloud (VPC) by configuring internet access or a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. For more information, see Networking and Access for Amazon AppStream 2.0 and Using Amazon S3 VPC Endpoints for Home Folders and Application Settings Persistence.
You can enable or disable home folders while creating a stack (see Create a Stack), or after the stack is created by using the AWS Management Console for AppStream 2.0, AWS SDK, or AWS CLI. For each AWS Region, home folders are backed up by an Amazon S3 bucket.
The first time you enable home folders for an AppStream 2.0 stack in an AWS Region, the service creates an Amazon S3 bucket in your account in that same Region. The same bucket is used to store the content of home folders for all users and all stacks in that Region. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Storage.
Note
For guidance that you can provide your users to help them get started with using home folders during AppStream 2.0 streaming sessions, see Use Home Folders.

Disable Home Folders
You can disable home folders for a stack without losing user content already stored in home folders. Disabling home folders for a stack has the following effects:
 Users who are connected to active streaming sessions for the stack receive an error message. They are informed that they can no longer store content in their home folder. 
 Home folders do not appear for any new sessions that use the stack with home folders disabled. 
 Disabling home folders for one stack does not disable it for other stacks. 
 Even if home folders are disabled for all stacks, AppStream 2.0 does not delete the user content.
To restore access to home folders for the stack, enable home folders again by following the steps described earlier in this topic. 
To disable home folders while creating a stack
 Follow the steps in Create a Stack and make sure that the Enable Home Folders option is cleared.
To disable home folders for an existing stack


Open the AppStream 2.0 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2.


In the left navigation pane, choose Stacks, and select the stack.


Below the stacks list, choose Storage and clear Enable Home Folders.


In the Disable Home Folders dialog box, type CONFIRM (case-sensitive) to confirm your choice, then choose Disable.


Amazon S3 Bucket Storage
AppStream 2.0 manages user content stored in home folders by using Amazon S3 buckets created in your account. For every AWS Region, AppStream 2.0 creates a bucket in your account. All user content generated from streaming sessions of stacks in that Region is stored in that bucket. The buckets are fully managed by the service without any input or configuration from an administrator. The buckets are named in a specific format as follows: 
appstream2-36fb080bb8-region-code-account-id-without-hyphens
Where region-code is the AWS Region code in which the stack is created and account-id-without-hyphens is your AWS account ID. The first part of the bucket name, appstream2-36fb080bb8-, does not change across accounts or Regions. 
For example, if you enable home folders for stacks in the US West (Oregon) Region (us-west-2) on account number 123456789012, the service creates an Amazon S3 bucket in that Region with the name shown. Only an administrator with sufficient permissions can delete this bucket.
appstream2-36fb080bb8-us-west-2-123456789012
As mentioned earlier, disabling home folders for stacks does not delete any user content stored in the Amazon S3 bucket. To permanently delete user content, an administrator with adequate access must do so from the Amazon S3 console. AppStream 2.0 adds a bucket policy that prevents accidental deletion of the bucket. For more information, see Using IAM Policies to Manage Administrator Access to the Amazon S3 Bucket for Home Folders and Application Settings Persistence. 
Additional Resources
For more information about managing Amazon S3 buckets and best practices, see the following topics in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide: 
 You can provide offline access to user data for your users with Amazon S3 policies. For more information, see Allow Users to Access a Personal "Home Directory" in Amazon S3.
 You can enable file versioning for content stored in Amazon S3 buckets used by AppStream 2.0. For more information, see Using Versioning.
Home Folder Formats
When home folders are enabled, each user is provided with one unique folder in which to store their content. The folder is created and maintained as a unique Amazon S3 object within the bucket for that Region. The hierarchy of a user folder depends on how the user launches a streaming session, as described in the following sections.
AWS SDKs and AWS CLI
For sessions launched using CreateStreamingURL or create-streaming-url the user folder structure is as follows:
bucket-name/user/custom/user-id-SHA-256-hash/
Where bucket-name is in the format shown in Amazon S3 Bucket Storage and user-id-SHA-256-hash is the user-specific folder name created using a lowercase SHA-256 hash hexadecimal string generated from the UserId value passed to the CreateStreamingURL API operation or create-streaming-url command. For more information, see CreateStreamingURL in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 API Reference and create-streaming-url in the AWS CLI Command Reference.
The following example folder structure applies to session access using the API or AWS CLI with a UserId testuser@mydomain.com, account id 123456789012 in the US West (Oregon) Region (us-west-2):
appstream2-36fb080bb8-us-west-2-123456789012/user/custom/a0bcb1da11f480d9b5b3e90f91243143eac04cfccfbdc777e740fab628a1cd13/
You can identify the folder for a user by generating the lowercase SHA-256 hash value of the UserId using websites or open source coding libraries available online.
SAML
For sessions created using SAML federation, the user folder structure is as follows:
bucket-name/user/federated/user-id-SHA-256-hash/
In this case, user-id-SHA-256-hash is the folder name created using a lowercase SHA-256 hash hexadecimal string generated from the NameID SAML attribute value passed in the SAML federation request. To differentiate users who have the same name but belong to two different domains, send the SAML request with NameID in the format domainname\username. For more information, see Single Sign-on Access (SAML 2.0).
The following example folder structure applies to session access using SAML federation with NameID SAMPLEDOMAIN\testuser, account ID 123456789012 in the US West (Oregon) Region:
appstream2-36fb080bb8-us-west-2-123456789012/user/federated/8dd9a642f511609454d344d53cb861a71190e44fed2B8aF9fde0C507012a9901
When part or all of the NameID string is capitalized (as the domain name SAMPLEDOMAIN is in the example), AppStream 2.0 generates the hash value based on the capitalization used in the string. Using this example, the hash value for SAMPLEDOMAIN\testuser is 8DD9A642F511609454D344D53CB861A71190E44FED2B8AF9FDE0C507012A9901. In the folder for that user, this value is displayed in lowercase, as follows: 8dd9a642f511609454d344d53cb861a71190e44fed2B8aF9fde0C507012a9901. 
You can identify the folder for a user by generating the SHA-256 hash value of the NameID using websites or open source coding libraries available online.
Using the AWS Command Line Interface or AWS SDKs
You can enable and disable home folders for a stack by using the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs.
Use the following create-stack command to enable home folders while creating a new stack:
aws appstream create-stack --name ExampleStack ‚Äì-storage-connectors type=HOMEFOLDERS
Use the following update-stack command to enable home folders for an existing stack:
aws appstream update-stack ‚Äì-name ExistingStack ‚Äì-storage-connectors type=HOMEFOLDERS
Use the following command to disable home folders for an existing stack. This command does not delete any user data.
aws appstream update-stack ‚Äìname ExistingStack ‚Äì-delete-storage-connectors
