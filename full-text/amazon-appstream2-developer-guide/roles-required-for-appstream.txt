Roles Required for AppStream 2.0 and Application Auto Scaling
In AWS, IAM roles are used to give permissions to an AWS service so it can access AWS resources. The policies that are attached to the role determine which AWS resources the service can access and what it can do with those resources. For AppStream 2.0, in addition to having the permissions defined in the AmazonAppStreamFullAccess policy, you must also have the following roles in your AWS account, with the required policies attached.

 AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling_AppStreamFleet
These roles are automatically created for you, with the required IAM policies attached, when you get started with the AppStream 2.0 service in an AWS Region. To get started with AppStream 2.0, you must have either of the following permissions:
 AdministratorAccess permissions
 Permissions to create an IAM role and attach IAM policies to a role
Note
To create the AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling_AppStreamFleet role, you must have also have the iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission.
AmazonAppStreamServiceAccess
While AppStream 2.0 resources are being created, the AppStream 2.0 service makes API calls to other AWS services on your behalf by assuming this role. To create fleets, you must have this service role in your account. If this service role is not in your AWS account and the required IAM permissions and trust relationship policies are not attached, you cannot create AppStream 2.0 fleets.
ApplicationAutoScalingForAmazonAppStreamAccess
Automatic scaling is a feature of AppStream 2.0 fleets. To configure scaling policies, you must have this service role in your AWS account. If this service role is not in your AWS account and the required IAM permissions and trust relationship policies are not attached, you cannot scale AppStream 2.0 fleets.
AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling_AppStreamFleet
Application Auto Scaling uses a service-linked role to perform automatic scaling on your behalf. A service-linked role is an IAM role that is linked directly to an AWS service. This role includes all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.
For more information, see Service-Linked Roles in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.
