Install and Configure the AppStream 2.0 Client
You can have your users install the AppStream 2.0 client themselves, or you can install the AppStream 2.0 client for them by running PowerShell scripts remotely.
You must qualify the USB devices that you want to enable your users to use with their streaming session. If their USB device is not qualified, it won't be detected by AppStream 2.0 and can't be shared with the session.
