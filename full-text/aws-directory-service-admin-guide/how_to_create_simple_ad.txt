To create a Simple AD directory


In the AWS Directory Service console navigation pane, choose Directories and then choose Set up directory.


On the Select directory type page, choose Simple AD, and then choose Next.


On the Enter directory information page, provide the following information:
Directory size
Choose from either the Small or Large size option. For more information about sizes, see Simple Active Directory.

Directory DNS name
The fully qualified name for the directory, such as corp.example.com.
Directory NetBIOS name
The short name for the directory, such as CORP.
Administrator password

The directory administrator password is case-sensitive and must be between 8 and 64 characters in length, inclusive. It must also contain at least one character from three of the following four categories:
    Lowercase letters (a-z)
    Uppercase letters (A-Z)
    Numbers (0-9)
    Non-alphanumeric characters (\~!@#$%^&*_-=`|\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?/)
Confirm password
Retype the administrator password.
Directory description
An optional description for the directory.


On the Choose VPC and subnets page, provide the following information, and then choose Next.
VPC
The VPC for the directory.
Subnets
Choose the subnets for the domain controllers. The two subnets must be in different Availability Zones. 


On the Review & create page, review the directory information and make any necessary changes. When the information is correct, choose Create directory. It takes several minutes for the directory to be created. Once created, the Status value changes to Active.
