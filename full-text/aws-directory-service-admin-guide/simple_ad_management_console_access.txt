Enable Access to the AWS Management Console with AD Credentials
AWS Directory Service allows you to grant members of your directory access to the AWS Management Console. By default, your directory members do not have access to any AWS resources. You assign IAM roles to your directory members to give them access to the various AWS services and resources. The IAM role defines the services, resources, and level of access that your directory members have.
Before you can grant console access to your directory members, your directory must have an access URL. For more information about how to view directory details and get your access URL, see View Directory Information. For more information about how to create an access URL, see Creating an Access URL.
For more information about how to create and assign IAM roles to your directory members, see Grant Users and Groups Access to AWS Resources.

Enable AWS Management Console Access
By default, console access is not enabled for any directory. To enable console access for your directory users and groups, perform the following steps:
To enable console access


In the AWS Directory Service console navigation pane, choose Directories.


On the Directories page, choose your directory ID.


On the Directory details page, select the Application management tab.


Under the AWS Management Console section, choose Enable. Console access is now enabled for your directory.


Before users can sign-in to the console with your access URL, you must first add your users to the role. For general information about assigning users to IAM roles, see Assigning Users or Groups to an Existing Role. After the IAM roles have been assigned, users can then access the console using your access URL. For example, if your directory access URL is example-corp.awsapps.com, the URL to access the console is https://example-corp.awsapps.com/console/.

After that, users must sign in again to start the next 1 hour session before being logged off again. You can use the following procedure to change the length of time to up to 12 hours per session.
