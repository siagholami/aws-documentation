Migrate Users from Active Directory to AWS Managed Microsoft AD
You can use the Active Directory Migration Toolkit (ADMT) along with the Password Export Service (PES) to migrate users from your self-managed AD to your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory. This enables you to migrate AD objects and encrypted passwords for your users more easily.
For detailed instructions, see How to migrate your on-premises domain to AWS Managed Microsoft AD using ADMT on the AWS Security Blog.
