Create a Group
Use the following procedure to create a security group with an EC2 instance that is joined to your Simple AD directory.
To create a group

Open the Active Directory Users and Computers tool. There is a shortcut to this tool in the Administrative Tools folder.
Tip
You can run the following from a command prompt on the instance to open the Active Directory Users and Computers tool box directly.  

%SystemRoot%\system32\dsa.msc


In the directory tree, select an OU under your directory's NetBIOS name OU where you want to store your group (for example, Corp\Users). For more information about the OU structure used by directories in AWS, see What Gets Created.


On the Action menu, click New, and then click Group to open the new group wizard.


Type a name for the group in Group name, select a Group scope, and select Security for the Group type. 


Click OK. The new security group will appear in the Users folder.
