Step 2: Prepare Your AWS Managed Microsoft AD
Now let's get your AWS Managed Microsoft AD ready for the trust relationship. Many of the following steps are almost identical to what you just completed for your on-premises domain. This time, however, you are working with your AWS Managed Microsoft AD.
Configure Your VPC Subnets and Security Groups
You must allow traffic from your on-premises network to the VPC containing your AWS Managed Microsoft AD. To do this, you will need to make sure that the ACLs associated with the subnets used to deploy your AWS Managed Microsoft AD and the security group rules configured on your domain controllers, both allow the requisite traffic to support trusts. 
Port requirements vary based on the version of Windows Server used by your domain controllers and the services or applications that will be leveraging the trust. For the purposes of this tutorial, you will need to open the following ports: 
Inbound
 TCP/UDP 53 - DNS
 TCP/UDP 88 - Kerberos authentication
 UDP 123 - NTP 
 TCP 135 - RPC 
 UDP 137-138 - Netlogon 
 TCP 139 - Netlogon 
 TCP/UDP 389 - LDAP 
 TCP/UDP 445 - SMB 
Note
SMBv1 is no longer supported.
 TCP/UDP 464 - Kerberos authentication
 TCP 636 - LDAPS (LDAP over TLS/SSL) 
 TCP 873 - Rsync 
 TCP 3268-3269 - Global Catalog 
 TCP/UDP 1024-65535 - Ephemeral ports for RPC
 ICMP All 
Outbound
 ALL
Note
These are the minimum ports that are needed to be able to connect the VPC and on-premises directory. Your specific configuration may require additional ports be open. 
To configure your AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain controller outbound and inbound rules


Return to the AWS Directory Service console. In the list of directories, take note the directory ID for your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Security Groups.


Use the search box to search for your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory ID. In the search results, select the item with the description AWS created security group for  directory controllers.



Go to the Outbound Rules tab for that security group. Choose Edit, and then Add another rule. For the new rule, enter the following values: 
    Type: ALL Traffic
    Protocol: ALL
    Destination determines the traffic that can leave your domain controllers and where it can go. Specify a single IP address or an IP address range in CIDR notation (for example, 203.0.113.5/32). You can also specify the name or ID of another security group in the same region. For more information, see Understand Your Directory’s AWS Security Group Configuration and Use.


Select Save.



Go to the Inbound Rules tab for that same security group. Choose Edit, and then Add another rule. For the new rule, enter the following values: 
    Type: Custom UDP Rule
    Protocol: UDP
    Port Range: 445
    For Source, specify a single IP address, or an IP address range in CIDR notation (for example, 203.0.113.5/32). You can also specify the name or ID of another security group in the same region. This setting determines the traffic that can reach your domain controllers. For more information, see Understand Your Directory’s AWS Security Group Configuration and Use.


Select Save.


Repeat steps 7 and 8, adding each of the following rules:  



[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
Ensure That Kerberos Pre-authentication Is Enabled
Now you want to confirm that users in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD also have Kerberos pre-authentication enabled. This is the same process you completed for your on-premises directory. This is the default, but let's check to make sure nothing has changed.
To view user Kerberos settings


Log in to an instance that is a member of your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory using either the Admin Account for the domain or an account that has been delegated permissions to manage users in the domain.


If they are not already installed, install the Active Directory Users and Computers tool and the DNS tool. Learn how to install these tools in Installing the Active Directory Administration Tools.


Open Server Manager. On the Tools menu, choose Active Directory Users and Computers.


Choose the Users folder in your domain. Note that this is the Users folder under your NetBIOS name, not the Users  folder under the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).



In the list of users, right-click on a user, and then choose Properties.


Choose the Account tab. In the Account options list, ensure that Do not require Kerberos preauthentication is not checked.
