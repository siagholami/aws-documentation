Deploying the CloudWatch Agent and the X-Ray Daemon on Amazon EKS or Kubernetes
These topics explain how to install the X-Ray daemon and the CloudWatch agent on Amazon EKS or Kubernetes.
Deploying the X-Ray Daemon on Amazon EKS or Kubernetes
To install the CloudWatch agent and the X-Ray daemon on Amazon EKS or Kubernetes, you can use a quick setup.
To install the CloudWatch agent and the X-Ray daemon on Amazon EKS or Kubernetes


Ensure that the IAM role that is attached to the EC2 instance, or the Kubernetes worker node, has the CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy and AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess policies attached.


Enter the following command:


curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/master/k8s-deployment-manifest-templates/deployment-mode/daemonset/cwagent-fluentd-xray/cwagent-fluentd-xray-quickstart.yaml | sed "s/{{cluster_name}}/cluster-name/;s/{{region_name}}/region/" | kubectl apply -f -
What the Quick Start Does
This section describes the quick setup of the CloudWatch agent and the X-Ray daemon.
 The quick setup specifies inbound ports and protocols. Outbound connections do not have to be explicitly opened.
 The quick setup installs the X-Ray daemon via the kubectl apply -f command with the following file content.
apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: DaemonSet
  metadata:
    name: xray-daemon
    namespace: amazon-cloudwatch
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        name: xray-daemon
    template:

        labels:
          name: xray-daemon
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: xray-daemon
            image: amazon/aws-xray-daemon:latest
            imagePullPolicy: Always
            ports:
              - containerPort: 2000
                hostPort: 2000
                protocol: UDP
            resources:
              limits:
                cpu:  100m
                memory: 256Mi
              requests:
                cpu: 50m
                memory: 50Mi
        terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
 The quick setup updates the CloudWatch agent using the Docker image version/label 1.231221.0 or later, or the latest version. You can find the image at https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/cloudwatch-agent.
 To enable the X-Ray SDK to read cluster name and Region information, the quick setup updates the CloudWatch agent using the Docker image version/label 1.231221.0, or later, or the latest. You can find the image at https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/cloudwatch-agent.
 To enable the X-Ray SDK to read cluster name and Region information, the quick setup created a file with the following content, and then applied it with the kubectl apply -f command.
```

# create role binding for XRay SDK to read config map
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Role
  metadata:
  name: container-insights-discovery-role
  namespace: amazon-cloudwatch
  rules:
  - apiGroups:
  - ""
  resourceNames:
  - cluster-info
  resources:
  - configmaps
  verbs:
  - get

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: RoleBinding
  metadata:
  name: service-users-cloudwatch-discovery-role-binding
  namespace: amazon-cloudwatch
  roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: container-insights-discovery-role
  subjects:
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
name: system:serviceaccounts
  ```
 The quick setup exposes the CloudWatch agent port that receives X-Ray SDK metrics. The default port is UDP 25888.
ports:
    - containerPort: 25888
      hostPort: 25888
      protocol: UDP
 The quick setup merges the agent configuration JSON with the X-Ray SDK metrics configuration with the following JSON.
{
    "logs": {
      "metrics_collected": {
        "emf": {}
      }
    }
  }
