Change the Period Override Setting or Refresh Interval for the CloudWatch Dashboard
You can specify how the period setting of graphs added to this dashboard are retained or modified.
To change the period override options


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


Choose Actions.


Under Period override, choose one of the following:
    Choose Auto to have the period of the metrics on each graph automatically adapt to the dashboard's time range.
    Choose Do not override to ensure that the period setting of each graph is always obeyed.
    Choose one of the other options to cause graphs added to the dashboard to always adapt that chosen time as their period setting.


The Period override always reverts to Auto when the dashboard is closed or the browser is refreshed. Different settings for Period override can't be saved.
You can change how often the data on your CloudWatch dashboard is refreshed or set it to automatically refresh.
