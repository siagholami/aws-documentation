Viewing Your Prometheus Metrics
You can monitor and alarm on all your Prometheus metrics including the curated pre-aggregated metrics from App Mesh, NGINX, Java/JMX, Memcached, and HAProxy, and any other manually configured Prometheus exporter you may have added. For more information about collecting metrics from other Prometheus exporters, see Tutorial for Adding a New Prometheus Scrape Target: Prometheus API Server Metrics.
In the CloudWatch console, Container Insights provides the following pre-built reports: 
 For Amazon EKS and Kubernetes clusters, there are pre-built reports for App Mesh, NGINX, HAPROXY, Memcached, and Java/JMX.
 For Amazon ECS clusters, there are pre-built reports for App Mesh and Java/JMX.
Container Insights also provides custom dashboards for each of the workloads that Container Insights collects curated metrics from. You can download these dashboards from GitHub

     HAProxy-Ingress custom dashboard source on Github
     Java/JMX custom dashboard source on Github.


Open the JSON file that you downloaded with a text editor, and make the following changes:
    Replace all the {{YOUR_CLUSTER-NAME}} strings with the exact name of your cluster. Make sure not to add whitespaces before or after the text.
    Replace all the {{YOUR_AWS_REGION}} strings with the AWS Region where your cluster is running. For example, us-west-1 Make sure not to add whitespaces before or after the text.
