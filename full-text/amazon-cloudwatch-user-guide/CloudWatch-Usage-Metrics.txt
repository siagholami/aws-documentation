CloudWatch Usage Metrics
CloudWatch collects metrics that track the usage of some AWS resources. These metrics correspond to AWS service quotas. Tracking these metrics can help you proactively manage your quotas. For more information, see Service Quotas Integration and Usage Metrics.
Service quota usage metrics are in the AWS/Usage namespace and are collected every minute.
Currently, the only metric name in this namespace that CloudWatch publishes is CallCount. This metric is published with the dimensions Resource, Service, and Type. The Resource dimension specifies the name of the API operation being tracked. For example, the CallCount metric with the dimensions "Service": "CloudWatch", "Type": "API" and "Resource": "PutMetricData" indicates the number of times the CloudWatch PutMetricData API operation has been called in your account.
The CallCount metric does not have a specified unit. The most useful statistic for the metric is SUM, which represents the total operation count for the 1-minute period.
