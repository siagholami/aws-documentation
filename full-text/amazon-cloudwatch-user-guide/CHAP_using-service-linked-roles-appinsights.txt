Using Service-Linked Roles for CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server
CloudWatch Application Insights uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server. Service-linked roles are predefined by CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server and include all of the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. 
A service-linked role makes setting up CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions. CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server can assume its roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.
For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS Services That Work with IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column. Choose a Yes link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.
Service-Linked Role Permissions for CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server
CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server uses the service-linked role named ApplicationInsights-role. Application Insights uses this role to perform operations such as analyzing the Resource Groups of the customer, creating CloudFormation stacks to create alarms on metrics, and configuring the CloudWatch Agent on EC2 instances.
The role permissions policy allows CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server to complete the following actions on all resources:
 cloudwatch:DescribeAlarmHistory
  cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms
  cloudwatch:GetMetricData
 cloudwatch:ListMetrics
 cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm
 cloudwatch:DeleteAlarms
 logs:GetLogEvents 
  logs:DescribeLogStreams
  logs:DescribeLogGroup
 events:DescribeRule 
 tag:GetResources 
 resource-groups:ListGroupResources 
 resource-groups:GetGroupQuery 
 elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers 
 elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetGroups 
 elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetHealth 
 Autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups 
 cloudFormation:DescribeStacks 
 cloudFormation:ListStackResources 
 ssm:GetOpsItem 
 ssm:CreateOpsItem 
 ssm:DescribeOpsItems 
 ssm:UpdateOpsItem 
 ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation 
 ec2:DescribeInstances 
 rds:DescribeDBInstances 
The role permissions policy allows CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server to complete the following actions on specified resources. These policies are used to manage resources created by or related to CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server in your account.
{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudFormation:CreateStack",
                "cloudFormation:UpdateStack",
                "cloudFormation:DeleteStack"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:cloudformation:*:*:stack/ApplicationInsights-*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:PutParameter",
                "ssm:DeleteParameter",
                "ssm:AddTagsToResource",
                "ssm:RemoveTagsFromResource"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:parameter/AmazonCloudWatch-ApplicationInsights-*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:CreateAssociation",
                "ssm:UpdateAssociation",
                "ssm:DeleteAssociation",
                "ssm:DescribeAssociation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
                "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:association/*",
                "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:managed-instance/*",
                "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:document/AWSEC2-ApplicationInsightsCloudwatchAgentInstallAndConfigure",
                "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:document/AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage",
                "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:document/AmazonCloudWatch-ManageAgent"
            ]
        },
            ]
        }
You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-Linked Role Permissions in the IAM User Guide.
Creating a Service-Linked Role for CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server
You don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you create a new Application Insights application in the AWS Management Console, CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server creates the service-linked role for you. 
If you delete this service-linked role, and then want to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account. When you create a new Application Insights application, CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server creates the service-linked role for you again. 
Editing a Service-Linked Role for CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server
CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server does not allow you to edit the ApplicationInsights-role service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
Deleting a Service-Linked Role for CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server
If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role. That way you avoid having an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained. However, you must delete all applications in Application Insights before you can manually delete the role.
Note
If the CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.
To delete CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server resources used by the ApplicationInsights-role
 Delete all of your CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server applications. For more information, see "Deleting Your Application(s)" in the CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server User Guide. 
To manually delete the service-linked role using IAM
Use the IAM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API to delete the ApplicationInsights-role service-linked role. For more information, see Deleting a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
