Creating a Storage Throughput Alarm that Sends Email
You can set up an SNS notification and configure an alarm that sends email when Amazon EBS exceeds 100 MB throughput.
Setting Up a Storage Throughput Alarm Using the AWS Management Console
Use these steps to use the AWS Management Console to create an alarm based on Amazon EBS throughput.
To create a storage throughput alarm that sends email


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Alarms, Create Alarm.


Under EBS Metrics, choose a metric category.


Select the row with the volume and the VolumeWriteBytes metric.


For the statistic, choose Average. For the period, choose 5 Minutes. Choose Next.


Under Alarm Threshold, enter a unique name for the alarm (for example, myHighWriteAlarm) and a description of the alarm (for example, VolumeWriteBytes exceeds 100,000 KiB/s). Alarm names must contain only ASCII characters.


Under Whenever, for is, choose > and enter 100000. For for, enter 15 consecutive periods.


A graphical representation of the threshold is shown under Alarm Preview.


Under Additional settings, for Treat missing data as, choose ignore (maintain alarm state) so that missing data points don't trigger alarm state changes.


Under Actions, for Whenever this alarm, choose State is ALARM. For Send notification to, choose an existing SNS topic or create one.


To create an SNS topic, choose New list. For Send notification to, enter a name for the SNS topic (for example, myHighCpuAlarm), and for Email list, enter a comma-separated list of email addresses to be notified when the alarm changes to the ALARM state. Each email address is sent a topic subscription confirmation email. You must confirm the subscription before notifications can be sent to an email address.

Choose Create Alarm.

To create a storage throughput alarm that sends email


Create an SNS topic. For more information, see Setting Up Amazon SNS Notifications.


Create the alarm.


1. aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name ebs-mon --alarm-description "Alarm when EBS volume exceeds 100MB throughput" --metric-name VolumeReadBytes --namespace AWS/EBS --statistic Average --period 300 --threshold 100000000 --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold --dimensions Name=VolumeId,Value=my-volume-id --evaluation-periods 3 --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111122223333:my-alarm-topic --insufficient-data-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111122223333:my-insufficient-data-topic


Test the alarm by forcing an alarm state change using the set-alarm-state command.


Change the alarm state from INSUFFICIENT_DATA to OK.
1. aws cloudwatch set-alarm-stateÂ --alarm-name ebs-mon --state-reason "initializing" --state-value OK


Change the alarm state from OK to ALARM.
1. aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name ebs-mon --state-reason "initializing" --state-value ALARM


Change the alarm state from ALARM to INSUFFICIENT_DATA.
1. aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --alarm-name ebs-mon --state-reason "initializing" --state-value INSUFFICIENT_DATA


Check that you have received an email notification about the alarm.
