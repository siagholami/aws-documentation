Viewing Available Metrics
Metrics are grouped first by namespace, and then by the various dimension combinations within each namespace. For example, you can view all EC2 metrics, EC2 metrics grouped by instance, or EC2 metrics grouped by Auto Scaling group.
Only the AWS services that you're using send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.
For a list of AWS services that send metrics to CloudWatch, see AWS Services That Publish CloudWatch Metrics. From this page, you can also see the metrics and dimensions that are published by each of those services.
Note
Metrics that have not had any new data points in the past two weeks do not appear in the console. They also do not appear when you type their metric name or dimension names in the search box in the All metrics tab in the console, and they are not returned in the results of a list-metrics command. The best way to retrieve these metrics is with the get-metric-data or get-metric-statistics commands in the AWS CLI.
If the old metric you want to view has a current metric with similar dimensions, you can view that current similar metric and then choose the Source tab, and change the metric name and dimension fields to the ones that you want, and also change the time range to a time when the metric was being reported.
To view available metrics by namespace and dimension using the console


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Metrics.


Select a metric namespace (for example, EC2).



Select a metric dimension (for example, Per-Instance Metrics).



The All metrics tab displays all metrics for that dimension in the namespace. You can do the following:


To sort the table, use the column heading.


To graph a metric, select the check box next to the metric. To select all metrics, select the check box in the heading row of the table.


To filter by resource, choose the resource ID and then choose Add to search.


To filter by metric, choose the metric name and then choose Add to search.



To view available metrics by namespace, dimension, or metric using the AWS CLI
Use the list-metrics command to list CloudWatch metrics. For a list of the namespaces, metrics, and dimensions for all services that publish metrics, see AWS Services That Publish CloudWatch Metrics.
The following example specifies the AWS/EC2 namespace to view all the metrics for Amazon EC2.
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/EC2
The following is example output.
{
  "Metrics" : [
    ...
    {
        "Namespace": "AWS/EC2",
        "Dimensions": [
            {
                "Name": "InstanceId",
                "Value": "i-1234567890abcdef0"
            }
        ],
        "MetricName": "NetworkOut"
    },
    {
        "Namespace": "AWS/EC2",
        "Dimensions": [
            {
                "Name": "InstanceId",
                "Value": "i-1234567890abcdef0"
            }
        ],
        "MetricName": "CPUUtilization"
    },
    {
        "Namespace": "AWS/EC2",
        "Dimensions": [
            {
                "Name": "InstanceId",
                "Value": "i-1234567890abcdef0"
            }
        ],
        "MetricName": "NetworkIn"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
To list all the available metrics for a specified resource
The following example specifies the AWS/EC2 namespace and the InstanceId dimension to view the results for the specified instance only.
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/EC2 --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-1234567890abcdef0
To list a metric for all resources
The following example specifies the AWS/EC2 namespace and a metric name to view the results for the specified metric only.
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/EC2 --metric-name CPUUtilization
