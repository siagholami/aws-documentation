Cross-Account Cross-Region CloudWatch Console
You can add cross-account functionality to your CloudWatch console. This functionality provides you with cross-account visibility to your dashboards, alarms, metrics, and automatic dashboards without having to log in and log out of different accounts.
You can then create dashboards that summarize CloudWatch data from multiple AWS accounts and multiple AWS Regions into a single dashboard.
Many organizations have their AWS resources deployed in multiple accounts, to provide billing and security boundaries. In this case, we recommend that you designate one or more of your accounts as your monitoring accounts, and build your cross-account dashboards in these accounts.
Cross-account functionality is integrated with AWS Organizations, to help you efficiently build your cross-account dashboards.
Cross-Region Functionality 
Cross-Region functionality is now built-in automatically. You do not need to take any extra steps to be able to display metrics from different Regions in a single account on the same graph or the same dashboard.
Enabling Cross-Account Functionality in CloudWatch
To set up cross-account functionality in your CloudWatch console, use the AWS Management Console to set up your sharing accounts and monitoring accounts.
Set Up A Sharing Account
You must enable sharing in each account that will make data available to the monitoring account. 
To enable your account to share CloudWatch data with other accounts


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Settings, then choose Configure.


Choose Share data.


For Sharing, choose Specific accounts and enter the IDs of the accounts that you want to share data with.


Any accounts that you specify here can view your account's CloudWatch data. Specify the IDs only of accounts that you know and trust.


For Permissions, specify how to share your data with one of the following options:
    Provide read-only access to your CloudWatch metrics, dashboards, and alarms. This option enables the monitoring accounts to create cross-account dashboards that include widgets that contain CloudWatch data from your account.
    Include CloudWatch automatic dashboards. If you select this option, users in the monitoring account can also view the information in this account's automatic dashboards. For more information, see Getting Started with Amazon CloudWatch.
    Include X-Ray read-only access for ServiceLens. If you select this option, users in the monitoring account can also view the ServiceLens service map and X-Ray trace information in this account. For more information, see Using ServiceLens to Monitor the Health of Your Applications.
    Full read-only access to everything in your account. This option enables the accounts that you use for sharing to create cross-account dashboards that include widgets that contain CloudWatch data from your account. It also enables those accounts to look deeper into your account and view your account's data in the consoles of other AWS services.


Choose Launch CloudFormation template.


In the confirmation screen, type Confirm, and choose Launch template.

Select the I acknowledge...  check box, and choose Create stack.

Sharing With an Entire Organization
Completing the preceding procedure creates an IAM role which enables your account to share data with one account. You can create or edit an IAM role that shares your data with all accounts in an organization. Do this only if you know and trust all accounts in the organization.
To share your CloudWatch account data with all accounts in an organization


If you haven't already, complete the preceding procedure to share your data with one AWS account.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles.


In the list of roles, choose CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole.


Choose Trust relationships, Edit trust relationship.


You see a policy like this:
{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }

Change the policy to the following, replacing org-id with the ID of your organization.

```
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "*"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
           "StringEquals": {
             "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "org-id"
           }
         }
   }
 ]

}
   ```

Choose Update Trust Policy.

Set Up a Monitoring Account
Enable each monitoring account if you want to view cross-account CloudWatch data. 
When you complete the following procedure, CloudWatch creates a service-linked role that CloudWatch uses in the monitoring account to access data shared from your other accounts. This service-linked role is called AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchCrossAccount. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for CloudWatch.
To enable your account to view cross-account CloudWatch data


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Settings, then choose Configure.


Under View cross-account cross-region, choose one of the following options:
    Account Id Input. This option prompts you to manually input an account ID each time that you want to switch accounts when you view cross-account data.
    AWS Organization account selector. This option causes the accounts that you specified when you completed your cross-account integration with Organizations to appear. When you next use the console, CloudWatch displays a dropdown list of these accounts for you to select from when you are viewing cross-account data.
To do this, you must have first used your organization master account to allow CloudWatch to see a list of accounts in your organization. For more information, see (Optional) Integrate With AWS Organizations.
    Custom account selector. This option prompts you to enter a list of account IDs. When you next use the console, CloudWatch displays a dropdown list of these accounts for you to select from when you are viewing cross-account data.
You can also enter a label for each of these accounts to help you identify them when choosing accounts to view.
The account selector settings that a user makes here are retained only for that user, not for all other users in the monitoring account. 


Choose Enable.


After you complete this setup, you can create cross-account dashboards. For more information, see Cross-Account Cross-Region Dashboards.
(Optional) Integrate With AWS Organizations
If you want to integrate cross-account functionality with AWS Organizations, you must make a list of all accounts in the organization available to the monitoring accounts.
To enable cross-account CloudWatch functionality to access a list of all accounts in your organization


Log in to your organization's master account.


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Settings, then choose Configure.


For Grant permission to view the list of accounts in the organization, choose Specific accounts to be prompted to enter a list of account IDs. The list of accounts in your organization are shared with only the accounts that you specify here.


Choose Share organization account list.


Choose Launch CloudFormation template.


In the confirmation screen, type Confirm, and choose Launch template.
Troubleshooting Your CloudWatch Cross-Account Setup
This section contains troubleshooting tips for cross-account, console deployment in CloudWatch.
I am getting access denied errors displaying cross-account data
Check the following:
 Your monitoring account should have a role named AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchCrossAccount. If it does not, you need to create this role. For more information, see Set Up a Monitoring Account.
 Each sharing account should have a role named CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole. If it does not, you need to create this role. For more information, see Set Up A Sharing Account.
 The sharing role must trust the monitoring account.
To confirm that your roles are set up properly for the CloudWatch cross-account console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles.


In the list of roles, make sure the needed role exists. In a sharing account, look for CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole. In a monitoring account, look for AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchCrossAccount.


If you are in a sharing account and CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole already exists, choose CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole.


Choose Trust relationships, Edit trust relationship.


Confirm that the policy lists either the account ID of the monitoring account, or the organization ID of an organization that contains the monitoring account.


I don't see an account drop-down in the console
First, check that you have created the correct IAM roles, as discussed in the preceding troubleshooting section. If those are set up correctly, make sure that you have enabled this account to view cross-account data, as described in Enable Your Account to View Cross-Account Data.
