Create IAM Roles and Users for Use With CloudWatch Agent
Access to AWS resources requires permissions. You create an IAM role, an IAM user, or both to grant permissions that the CloudWatch agent needs to write metrics to CloudWatch. If you're going to use the agent on Amazon EC2 instances, you must create an IAM role. If you're going to use the agent on on-premises servers, you must create an IAM user.
Note
We recently modified the following procedures by using new CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy and CloudWatchAgentAdminPolicy policies created by Amazon, instead of requiring customers to create these policies themselves. For writing files to and downloading files from the Parameter Store, the policies created by Amazon support only files with names that start with AmazonCloudWatch-. If you have a CloudWatch agent configuration file with a file name that doesn't start with AmazonCloudWatch-, these policies can't be used to write the file to Parameter Store or download it from Parameter Store.
If you're going to run the CloudWatch agent on Amazon EC2 instances, use the following steps to create the necessary IAM role. This role provides permissions for reading information from the instance and writing it to CloudWatch.
