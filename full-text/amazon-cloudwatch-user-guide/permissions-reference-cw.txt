Amazon CloudWatch Permissions Reference
When you are setting up Access Control and writing permissions policies that you can attach to an IAM identity (identity-based policies), you can use the following table as a reference. The table lists each CloudWatch API operation and the corresponding actions for which you can grant permissions to perform the action. You specify the actions in the policy's Action field, and you specify a wildcard character (*) as the resource value in the policy's Resource field.
You can use AWS-wide condition keys in your CloudWatch policies to express conditions. For a complete list of AWS-wide keys, see AWS Global and IAM Condition Context Keys in the IAM User Guide.
Note
To specify an action, use the cloudwatch: prefix followed by the API operation name. For example: cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics, cloudwatch:ListMetrics, or cloudwatch:* (for all CloudWatch actions).
