Searching for Available Metrics
You can search within all of the metrics in your account using targeted search terms. Metrics are returned that have matching results within their namespace, metric name, or dimensions.
Note
Metrics that have not had any new data points in the past two weeks do not appear in the console. They also do not appear when you type their metric name or dimension names in the search box in the All metrics tab in the console, and they are not returned in the results of a list-metrics command. The best way to retrieve these metrics is with the get-metric-data or get-metric-statistics commands in the AWS CLI.
To search for available metrics in CloudWatch


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Metrics.


In the search field on the All metrics tab, enter a search term, such as a metric name, namespace, dimension name or value, or resource name. This shows you all of the namespaces with metrics with this search term.


For example, if you search for volume, this shows the namespaces that contain metrics with this term in their name.
