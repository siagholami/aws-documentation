(Optional) Set Up Sample Containerized Workloads for Prometheus Metric Testing
To test the Prometheus metric support in CloudWatch Container Insights, you can set up one or more of the following containerized workloads. The CloudWatch agent with Prometheus support automatically collects metrics from each of these workloads. To see the metrics that are collected by default, see Prometheus Metrics Collected by the CloudWatch Agent.
Before you can install any of these workloads, you must install Helm 3.x by entering the following commands:
brew install helm
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
For more information, see Helm.
