Deleting a Service-Linked Role for Application Discovery Service
If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role. That way you don’t have an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained. However, you must clean up your service-linked role before you can manually delete it.
Cleaning Up the Service-Linked Role
Before you can use IAM to delete a service-linked role, you must first delete any resources used by the role.
Note
If Application Discovery Service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.

Manually Delete the Service-Linked Role
You can delete the AWSServiceRoleForApplicationDiscoveryServiceContinuousExport service-linked role by using the IAM console, the IAM CLI, or the IAM API. If you no longer need to use the Discovery Service - Continuous Export features that require this service-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role. That way you don’t have an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained. For more information, see Deleting a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
