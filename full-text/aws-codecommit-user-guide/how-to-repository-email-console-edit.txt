Change or disable notifications
You can use the AWS CodeCommit console to change how notifications created before November 5, 2019 are configured, including the event types that send emails to users and the Amazon SNS topic used to send emails about the repository. You can also use the CodeCommit console to manage the list of email addresses and endpoints subscribed to the topic or to disable notifications. 
To change notification settings


Open the CodeCommit console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/home.


In Repositories, choose the name of the repository where you want to configure notifications created before November 5, 2019. 


In the navigation pane, choose Settings, and then choose Notifications. If you see a banner informing you that you have notifications instead of notification rules, choose Manage existing notifications.


Choose Edit.


Make your changes, and then choose Save.


Disabling notifications is an easy way to temporarily prevent users from receiving emails about repository events. 
To permanently delete a notification created before November 5, 2019, follow the steps in Delete notifications.
