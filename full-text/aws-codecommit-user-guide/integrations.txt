Integration with other AWS services
CodeCommit is integrated with the following AWS services:









AWS Amplify
AWS Amplify makes it easy to create, configure, and implement scalable mobile applications powered by AWS. Amplify seamlessly provisions and manages your mobile backend and provides a simple framework to easily integrate your backend with your iOS, Android, Web, and React Native frontends. Amplify also automates the application release process of both your frontend and backend, which makes it possible for you to deliver features faster. You can connect your CodeCommit repository in the Amplify console. After you authorize the Amplify console, Amplify fetches an access token from the repository provider, but it doesn't store the token on the AWS servers. Amplify accesses your repository using deploy keys installed in a specific repository only. Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


AWS Cloud9
AWS Cloud9 contains a collection of tools that you use to code, build, run, test, debug, and release software in the cloud. This collection of tools is referred to as the AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment, or IDE.  You access the AWS Cloud9 IDE through a web browser. The IDE offers a rich code-editing experience with support for several programming languages and runtime debuggers, and a built-in terminal.  Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


AWS CloudFormation
AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications. You create a template that describes resources, including a CodeCommit repository, and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


AWS CloudTrail
CloudTrail captures AWS API calls and related events made by or on behalf of an AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. You can configure CloudTrail to capture API calls from the AWS CodeCommit console, CodeCommit commands from the AWS CLI, the local Git client, and from the CodeCommit API.  Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Amazon CloudWatch Events
CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams. CloudWatch Events becomes aware of operational changes as they occur. CloudWatch Events responds to these operational changes and takes action as necessary, by sending messages to respond to the environment, activating functions, making changes, and capturing state information.   You can configure CloudWatch Events to monitor CodeCommit repositories and respond to repository events by targeting streams, functions, tasks, or other processes in other AWS services, such as Amazon Simple Queue Service, Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda, and many more. Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


AWS CodeBuild
CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud that compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. You can store the source code to be built and the build specification in a CodeCommit repository. You can use CodeBuild directly with CodeCommit, or you can incorporate both CodeBuild and CodeCommit in a continuous delivery pipeline with CodePipeline. Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer
Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer is an automated code review service that uses program analysis and machine learning to detect common issues and recommend fixes in your Java code. You can associate repositories in your AWS account with CodeGuru Reviewer. When you do, CodeGuru Reviewer creates a service-linked role that allows CodeGuru Reviewer to analyze code in all pull requests created after the association is made. Learn more:[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


AWS CodePipeline
CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service you can use to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software. You can configure CodePipeline to use a CodeCommit repository as a source action in a pipeline, and automate building, testing, and deploying your changes. Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


AWS CodeStar
AWS CodeStar is a cloud-based service for creating, managing, and working with software development projects on AWS. You can quickly develop, build, and deploy applications on AWS with an AWS CodeStar project. An AWS CodeStar project creates and integrates AWS services for your project development toolchain, including a CodeCommit repository for the project. AWS CodeStar also assigns permissions to team members for that project. These permissions are applied automatically, including permissions for accessing CodeCommit, creating and managing Git credentials, and more.  You can configure repositories created for AWS CodeStar projects just as you would any other CodeCommit repository by using the AWS CodeCommit console, CodeCommit commands from the AWS CLI, the local Git client, and from the CodeCommit API.  Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Elastic Beanstalk is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. You can use the Elastic Beanstalk command line interface (EB CLI) to deploy your application directly from a new or existing CodeCommit repository. Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


AWS Key Management Service
AWS KMS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. By default, CodeCommit uses AWS KMS to encrypt repositories.  Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


AWS Lambda
Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can configure triggers for CodeCommit repositories that invoke Lambda functions in response to repository events.  Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Amazon Simple Notification Service
Amazon SNS is a web service that enables applications, end users, and devices to instantly send and receive notifications from the cloud. You can configure triggers for CodeCommit repositories that send Amazon SNS notifications in response to repository events. You can also use Amazon SNS notifications to integrate with other AWS services. For example, you can use an Amazon SNS notification to send messages to an Amazon Simple Queue Service queue. Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]
