Associate or disassociate an AWS CodeCommit repository with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer
Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer is an automated code review service that uses program analysis and machine learning to detect common issues and recommend fixes in your Java code. You can associate repositories in your AWS account with CodeGuru Reviewer. When you do, CodeGuru Reviewer creates a service-linked role that allows CodeGuru Reviewer to analyze code in all pull requests created after the association is made. 
After you associate a repository, CodeGuru Reviewer analyzes and comments on any issues it finds when you create pull requests. Each comment is clearly marked as having come from CodeGuru Reviewer with the designation Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer. You can reply to these comments just as you would to any other comment in a pull request, and you can also provide feedback on the quality of the suggestion. This feedback is shared with CodeGuru Reviewer and can help improve the service and its suggestions. 
Note
You will not see comments from CodeGuru Reviewer in pull requests that were created before the repository was associated with it. You might not see comments in pull requests created after the association for the following reasons:
The pull request does not contain Java code.
CodeGuru Reviewer has not had enough time to run and review the code in the pull request. This process can take up to 30 minutes. Comments can appear as the review progresses, but commenting is not complete until the job status shows as Completed.
CodeGuru Reviewer did not find any issues in the Java code in the pull request.
The code review job failed to run. To review the status of a review for a pull request, see the Activity tab of the pull request.
You are viewing changes to the pull request in the Changes tab, the pull request has been updated, and Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer did not find any issues in the changes. Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer comments only appear in the Changes tab if the comments were made on the most recent revision of the pull request. They always appear in the Activity tab.
