Edit a trigger for a repository (AWS CLI)

At a terminal (Linux, macOS, or Unix) or command prompt (Windows), run the get-repository-triggers command to create a JSON file with the structure of all of the triggers configured for your repository. For example, to create a JSON file named MyTriggers.json with the structure of all of the triggers configured for a repository named MyDemoRepo:

aws codecommit get-repository-triggers --repository-name MyDemoRepo >MyTriggers.json
This command returns nothing, but a file named MyTriggers.json is created in the directory where you ran the command.

Edit the JSON file in a plain-text editor and make changes to the trigger block of the trigger you want to edit. Replace the configurationId pair with a repositoryName pair. Save the file.

For example, if you want to edit a trigger named MyFirstTrigger in the repository named MyDemoRepo so that it applies to all branches, replace configurationId with repositoryName, and remove the specified master and preprod branches in red italic text. By default, if no branches are specified, the trigger applies to all branches in the repository:
{
       "repositoryName": "MyDemoRepo", 
       "triggers": [
           {
               "destinationArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:80398EXAMPLE:MyCodeCommitTopic", 
               "branches": [
                   "master", 
                   "preprod"
               ], 
               "name": "MyFirstTrigger", 
               "customData": "", 
               "events": [
                   "all"
               ]
           }  
       ]
   }

At the terminal or command line, run the put-repository-triggers command. This updates all triggers for the repository, including the changes you made to the MyFirstTrigger trigger:

aws codecommit put-repository-triggers --repository-name MyDemoRepo file://MyTriggers.json
This command returns a configuration ID, similar to the following:
{
       "configurationId": "0123456-I-AM-AN-EXAMPLE"
   }
