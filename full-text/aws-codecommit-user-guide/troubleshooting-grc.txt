Cloning error: I cannot clone a CodeCommit repository from an IDE
Problem: When you try to clone a CodeCommit repository in an IDE, you see an error that says the endpoint or URL is not valid.
Possible fixes: Not all IDEs support the URL used by git-remote-codecommit during cloning. Clone the repository locally from the terminal or command line, and then add that local repo to your IDE. For more information, see Step 3: Connect to the CodeCommit console and clone the repository.
Push or pull error: I cannot push or pull commits from an IDE to a CodeCommit repository
Problem: When you try to pull or push code from an IDE, you see a connection error.
Possible fixes: The most common reason for this error is that the IDE is not compatible with Git remote helpers such as git-remote-codecommit. Instead of using the IDE functionality to commit, push, and pull code, update the local repo manually from the command line or terminal using Git commands.
