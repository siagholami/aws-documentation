Monitoring CodeCommit events in Amazon EventBridge and Amazon CloudWatch Events
You can monitor AWS CodeCommit events in EventBridge, which delivers a stream of real-time data from your own applications, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. EventBridge routes that data to targets such as AWS Lambda and Amazon Simple Notification Service. These events are the same as those that appear in Amazon CloudWatch Events, which delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. 
The following examples show events for CodeCommit.
Note
CodeCommit supports providing displayName and emailAddress information included in session tags in events, if that information is available. For more information, see Session Tags and Using tags to provide identity information in CodeCommit.
