Update a pull request
You can use the AWS CodeCommit console or the AWS CLI to update the title or description of a pull request. You might want to update the pull request because:
 Other users don't understand the description, or the original title is misleading.
 You want the title or description to reflect changes made to the source branch of an open pull request.
Update a pull request (console)
You can use the CodeCommit console to update the title and description of a pull request in an CodeCommit repository. 


Open the CodeCommit console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/home.


In Repositories, choose the name of the repository where you want to update a pull request. 


In the navigation pane, choose Pull requests.


By default, a list of all open pull requests is displayed. Choose the open pull request you want to update.


In the pull request, choose Details, and then choose Edit details to edit the title or description.
Note
You cannot update the title or description of a closed or merged pull request.


Update pull requests (AWS CLI)
To use AWS CLI commands with CodeCommit, install the AWS CLI. For more information, see Command line reference. 
You might also be interested in the following commands:
 update-pull-request-approval-state, to approve or revoke approval on a pull request.
 create-pull-request-approval-rule, to create an approval rule for a pull request.
 delete-pull-request-approval-rule, to delete an approval rule for a pull request.
To use the AWS CLI to update pull requests in a CodeCommit repository

To update the title of a pull request in a repository, run the update-pull-request-title command, specifying:
    The ID of the pull request (with the --pull-request-id option).
    The title of the pull request (with the --title option).

For example, to update the title of a pull request with the ID of 47:
aws codecommit update-pull-request-title --pull-request-id 47 --title "Consolidation of global variables - updated review"
If successful, this command produces output similar to the following:
