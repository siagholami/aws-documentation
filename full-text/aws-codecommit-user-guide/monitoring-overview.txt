Monitoring AWS CodeCommit
Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of CodeCommit and your other AWS solutions. AWS provides the following monitoring tools to watch CodeCommit, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when appropriate:
 Amazon EventBridge can be used to automate your AWS services and respond automatically to system events, such as application availability issues or resource changes. Events from AWS services are delivered to EventBridge in near real time. You can write simple rules to indicate which events are of interest to you and which automated actions to take when an event matches a rule. For more information, see Amazon EventBridge User Guide and Monitoring CodeCommit events in Amazon EventBridge and Amazon CloudWatch Events.
 Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. CloudWatch Events enables automated event-driven computing, as you can write rules that watch for certain events and trigger automated actions in other AWS services when these events happen. For more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide and Monitoring CodeCommit events in Amazon EventBridge and Amazon CloudWatch Events.
 Amazon CloudWatch Logs can be used to monitor, store, and access your log files from CloudTrail and other sources. CloudWatch Logs can monitor information in the log files and notify you when certain thresholds are met. You can also archive your log data in highly durable storage. For more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide.
 AWS CloudTrail captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred. For more information, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide and Logging AWS CodeCommit API calls with AWS CloudTrail.
