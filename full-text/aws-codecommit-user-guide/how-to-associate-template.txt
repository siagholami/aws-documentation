Associate an approval rule template with a repository
Approval rule templates are created in a specific AWS Region, but they do not affect any repositores in that AWS Region until they are associated. To apply a template to one or more repositories, you must associate the template with the repository or repositories. You can apply a single template to multiple repositories in an AWS Region. This helps you automate and standardize the development workflow in your repositories by creating consistent conditions for approving and merging pull requests.
You can only associate an approval rule template with repositories in the AWS Region where the approval rule template was created.

You might have associated repositories with an approval rule template when you created it. (That step is optional.) You can add or remove associations by editing the template.
To associate an approval rule template with repositories


Open the CodeCommit console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/home.


Choose Approval rule templates. Choose the template, and then choose Edit.


In Associated Repositories, choose the repositories from the Repositories list. Each associated repository appears under the list box.


Choose Save. Approval rules are now applied to any pull requests created in those associated repositories.


Associate an approval rule template (AWS CLI)
You can use the AWS CLI to associate an approval rule template with one or more repositories. 
To associate a template with a single repository

At the terminal or command line, run the associate-approval-rule-template-with-repository command, specifying:
    The name of the approval rule template you want to associate with a repository.
    The name of the repository to be associated with the approval rule template.

For example, to associate an approval rule template named 2-approver-rule-for-master with a repository named MyDemoRepo:
aws codecommit associate-approval-rule-template-with-repository --repository-name MyDemoRepo --approval-rule-template-name 2-approver-rule-for-master

If successful, this command returns nothing.

To associate a template with multiple repositories

At the terminal or command line, run the batch-associate-approval-rule-template-with-repositories command, specifying:
    The name of the approval rule template you want to associate with a repository.
    The names of the repositories to be associated with the approval rule template.

For example, to associate an approval rule template named 2-approver-rule-for-master with a repository named MyDemoRepo and MyOtherDemoRepo:
aws codecommit batch-associate-approval-rule-template-with-repositories --repository-names "MyDemoRepo", "MyOtherDemoRepo" --approval-rule-template-name 2-approver-rule-for-master

If successful, this command returns output similar to the following:

{
       "associatedRepositoryNames": [
           "MyDemoRepo",
           "MyOtherDemoRepo"
       ],
       "errors": []
   }
