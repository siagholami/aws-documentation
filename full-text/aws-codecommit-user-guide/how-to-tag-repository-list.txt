View tags for a repository
Tags can help you identify and organize your AWS resources and manage access to them. For more information about tagging strategies, see Tagging AWS Resources. For examples of tag-based access policies, see Example 5: Deny or allow actions on repositories with tags.
View tags for a repository (console)
You can use the CodeCommit console to view the tags associated with a CodeCommit repository. 


Open the CodeCommit console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/home.


In Repositories, choose the name of the repository where you want to view tags.


In the navigation pane, choose Settings. Choose Repository tags. 



View tags for a repository (AWS CLI)
Follow these steps to use the AWS CLI to view the AWS tags for a CodeCommit repository. If no tags have been added, the returned list is empty.
At the terminal or command line, run the list-tags-for-resource command. For example, to view a list of tag keys and tag values for a repository named MyDemoRepo with the ARN arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-2:111111111111:MyDemoRepo:
aws codecommit list-tags-for-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:codecommit:us-west-2:111111111111:MyDemoRepo
If successful, this command returns information similar to the following:
{
    "tags": {
        "Status": "Secret",
        "Team": "Saanvi"
    }
}
