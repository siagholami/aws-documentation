Delete notifications
If you no longer want to use notifications created for a repository before November 5, 2019, you can delete the Amazon CloudWatch Events rule associated with the notification. That will automatically delete the notification. It does not delete any subscriptions or the Amazon SNS topic used for notifications. 
Note
If you change the name of a repository from the console, notifications created before November 5, 2019 continue to work without modification. However, if you change the name of your repository from the command line or by using the API, notifications no longer work. The easiest way to restore notifications is to delete the notification settings and then configure them again.
To delete notification settings


Open the CodeCommit console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/home.


In Repositories, choose the name of the repository where you want to remove notifications created before November 5, 2019. 


In the navigation pane, choose Settings, and then choose Notifications. If you see a banner informing you that you have notifications instead of notification rules, choose Manage existing notifications.


In CloudWatch event rule, copy the name of the rule that was created for the notification.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In Events, choose Rules. In Name, paste the name of the rule created for the notification. Choose the rule, and in Actions, choose Delete.


(Optional) To change or delete the Amazon SNS topic used for notifications after you delete notification settings, go to the Amazon SNS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home. For more information, see Clean Up in Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide.
