Define the primary domain for your WordPress Multisite instance in Amazon Lightsail
Last updated: November 18, 2018 
A WordPress Multisite instance in Amazon Lightsail is designed to use multiple domains, or subdomains, for each blog site that you create within that instance. Because of this, you must define the primary domain to use for the main blog of your WordPress Multisite instance.
Prerequisites
Complete the following prerequisites in the order shown:
 Create a WordPress Multisite instance in Lightsail. For more information, see Create an Amazon Lightsail instance.
 Create a static IP and attach it to your WordPress Multisite instance in Lightsail. For more information, see Create a static IP and attach it to an instance in Amazon Lightsail.
 Add your domain to Lightsail by creating a DNS zone, then point it to the static IP that you attached to your WordPress Multisite instance. For more information, see Creating a DNS zone to manage your domainâ€™s DNS records in Amazon Lightsail.
 Allow time for the DNS changes to propagate through the internet's DNS. Then, you can continue to the Define the primary domain for your WordPress Multisite instance> section of this guide.
Define the primary domain for your WordPress Multisite instance
Complete these steps to ensure that your domain, such as example.com, redirects to the main blog of your WordPress Multisite instance.


Sign in to the Lightsail console.


On the Lightsail home page, choose the SSH quick connect icon for your WordPress Multisite instance.



After your Lightsail browser-based SSH session is connected, enter the following command to change the directory to /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress:


cd /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress

Enter the following command to define the primary domain name for your WordPress Multisite instance. Be sure to replace <domain> with the correct domain name for your WordPress Multisite.

sudo ./bnconfig --machine_hostname <domain>
Example:
sudo ./bnconfig --machine_hostname domains.com

Enter the following command to keep the bnconfig tool from automatically running every time the server restarts. The bnconfig tool runs automatically every time the server starts to reset the machine hostname to its IP address. This is an undesirable action when using a custom domain name.

sudo mv bnconfig bnconfig.disabled
At this point, browsing to the domain that you defined should redirect you to the main blog of your WordPress Multisite instance.
