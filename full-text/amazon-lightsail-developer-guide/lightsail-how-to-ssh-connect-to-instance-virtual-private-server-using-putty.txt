Connect to your Linux/Unix-based Lightsail instance using PuTTY
Last updated: January 13, 2020 
In addition to the browser-based SSH terminal in Lightsail, you can also connect to your Linux-based instance using an SSH client such as PuTTY. To learn how to set up PuTTY, see Download and set up PuTTY to connect using SSH in Lightsail.
Note
To connect to a Windows-based instance using RDP, see Connect to your Windows-based Lightsail instance.
You can use the default private key that Lightsail provides, a new private key from Lightsail, or another private key that you use with another service.


Start PuTTY (for example, from the Start menu, choose All Programs, PuTTY, PuTTY).


Choose Load, and then find your saved session.


If you don't have a saved session, see Step 4: Finish configuring PuTTY with your private key and instance information.

Log in using one of the following default user names depending on your instance operating system:
    Amazon Linux, FreeBSD, and openSUSE instances: ec2-user
    CentOS instances: centos
    Debian instances: admin
    Ubuntu instances: ubuntu
    Certified by Bitnami instances: bitnami
    Plesk instances: ubuntu
