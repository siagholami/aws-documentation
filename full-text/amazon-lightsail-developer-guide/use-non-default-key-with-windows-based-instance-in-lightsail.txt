Using the non-default key with Windows-based Lightsail instances
Last updated: October 16, 2017 
When you create a Windows Server-based Lightsail instance, we use the default password for the AWS Region where we create the instance. This makes it easier to connect using the browser-based remote desktop (RDP) client, as well as a client such as Remote Desktop Connection. 
Important
We strongly encourage you to let Lightsail generate the password for your instance. Since we don't store your custom password, you can risk losing access to your Lightsail instance if you change the Administrator password.
Changing your Administrator password using Windows Server
You can change your Administrator password using the Windows Server Change Password tool. Type Ctrl  Alt  Del on your Windows Server-based Lightsail instance, and then choose Change a password.
Decrypt your key
If you change your password on your Windows Server-based Lightsail instance, you can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to get information that helps you decrypt your password.
Get your ciphertext using the AWS CLI

If you haven't done so already, install and configure the AWS CLI.

For more information, see Configuring the AWS Command Line Interface to work with Amazon Lightsail.


Open a command prompt or a terminal.


Type the following command.


aws lightsail get-instance-access-details --instance-name my-instance
Where my-instance is the name of the instance you want to get information about.
You'll see output similar to the following.
{
       "accessDetails": {
           "username": "Administrator",
           "protocol": "rdp",
           "ipAddress": "12.345.678.910",
           "passwordData": {
               "ciphertext": "cipher",
               "keyPairName": "my-ohio-key"
           },
           "password": "",
           "instanceName": "2016-ohio-windows"
       }
   }

You can use the ciphertext with any available application to decrypt your password.
