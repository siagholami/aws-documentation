Contributing to the Amazon Lightsail documentation on GitHub
Last updated: January 17, 2020 
The Amazon Lightsail documentation is on GitHub in the Lightsail developer guide repository. In the repository, you can:
 Fix typos and documentation bugs, add information, and rewrite sentences and paragraphs in the interest of accuracy or clarity.
 Write and submit new guides if there's something missing that you would like to see documented.
 Review the commit history to learn more about new feature and service launches and to track improvements to the documentation.
In this guide, we show you how to edit an existing guide or how to create a new guide by creating a pull request on GitHub. After you submit a pull request, it will be reviewed by the Lightsail team and a decision will be made to accept it, reject it, or to engage in a conversation with you to learn more. If your pull request is accepted, it will be published to the Lightsail documentation in the next round of updates (typically within two weeks).
