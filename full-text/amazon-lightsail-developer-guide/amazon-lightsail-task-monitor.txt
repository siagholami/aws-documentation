The task monitor in the Amazon Lightsail console tracks the status of exporting Lightsail snapshots to Amazon EC2, or creating new EC2 instances from exported instance snapshots. These tasks can take a while depending on the size and configuration of the source instance or block storage disk. The task monitor displays the latest 20 tasks that are in progress or completed. It can be accessed from the top navigation pane on all pages of the Lightsail console. The task monitor icon is orange when a task is in progress, or grey when all tasks are completed.
