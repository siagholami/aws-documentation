Attach a validated SSL/TLS certificate to your Lightsail load balancer
Last updated: November 29, 2017 
After you verify that you control your domain, you'll receive the following notification on the Lightsail load balancer management page.

Your next step is to attach the certificate to your Lightsail load balancer.


From the Lightsail home page, choose Networking.


Choose your load balancer to manage it.


Select your certificate from the dropdown list where it says Select an SSL/TLS certificate to enable HTTPS.


Your certificate attaches and the yellow warning icon on the tab is gone.
