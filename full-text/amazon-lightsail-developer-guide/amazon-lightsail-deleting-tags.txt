Deleting tags in Amazon Lightsail
Last updated: November 28, 2018 
You can delete tags from an Amazon Lightsail resource. Deleting a tag from one resource does not delete the same tag from all other resources. To completely delete a tag from all resources, you must remove that tag from each resource. This guide provides the steps to delete tags from a resource.
Note
For more information about tags, what resources can be tagged, and the tag restrictions, see Tags in Amazon Lightsail.
To delete tags from a resource


Sign in to the Lightsail console.


On the Lightsail home page, choose the tab for the resource type that you want to delete tags from. For example, to delete tags from a DNS zone, choose the Networking tab. Or choose the Instances tab to delete tags from an instance.
Note
Instances, databases, disks, DNS zones, and load balancers can be tagged using the Lightsail console. However, more Lightsail resources can be tagged using the Lightsail API operations, or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or SDKs. For a full list of Lightsail resources that support tagging, see Tags in Amazon Lightsail.


Choose the resource that you want to delete tags from.


On the management page for the resource you selected, choose the Tags tab.



Do one of the following, depending on the type of tag that you want to delete from the resource:


Choose Edit key-only tags, then choose the delete icon (X) for the tag that you want to delete from the resource. Choose Save when youâ€™re done deleting tags to remove them from the resource, or choose Cancel to not remove them.



To remove a key-value tag, choose the delete icon (X) for the key-value tag. At the prompt, choose Yes, delete to remove the key-value tag, or choose No, cancel to not remove it.
