Resources in Amazon Lightsail and AWS
Note
In AWS, everything you create and work with is called a resource. A virtual private server (or instance) is a resource, a database is a resource, and so on. In Lightsail, resources include Lightsail instances, static IP addresses, DNS zones, and instance snapshots.
