Create an access key to use the Amazon Lightsail API or the AWS Command Line Interface
Last updated: May 17, 2017 
To use the Lightsail API or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), you need to create a new access key. The access key consists of an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. Use the following procedures to create the key and configure the AWS CLI to make calls to the Lightsail API.
Step 1: Create a new access key
You can create a new access key in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console. 


Open Your Security Credentials in the IAM console.


Choose Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).


Choose Create New Access Key. 
Note
You can have a maximum of two access keys (active or inactive) at a time.


Choose Show Access Key to see your Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. 


You can copy them from this screen or choose Download Key File to download a .csv file containing the access keys.
Important
Keep your access keys in a safe place. You should name the file something like MyLightsailKeys.csv so that you don't struggle to find them later.
Step 2: Configure the AWS CLI
If you haven't installed the AWS CLI, you can do that now. See Installing the AWS Command Line Interface. After you install the AWS CLI, you need to configure it so you can use it. 


Open a terminal window or command prompt.


Type aws configure.


Paste your AWS Access Key ID from the .csv file you created in the previous step.


Paste your AWS Secret Access Key when prompted.


Enter the AWS Region where your resources are located. For example, if your resources are primarily in Ohio, choose us-east-2 when prompted for the Default region name.


For more information about using the AWS CLI --region option, see General Options in the AWS CLI Reference.

Choose a Default output format, such as json.
