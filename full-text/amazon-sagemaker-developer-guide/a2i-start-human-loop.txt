Create and Start a Human Loop
A human loop starts your human review workflow and sends data review tasks to human workers. When you use one of the Amazon A2I built-in task types, the corresponding AWS service creates and starts a human loop on your behalf when the conditions specified in your flow definition are met. If no conditions were specified in your flow definition, a human loop is created for each object. When using Amazon A2I for a custom task, a human loops starts when StartHumanLoop is called in your application. 
Use the following instructions to configure a human loop with Amazon Rekognition or Amazon Textract built-in task types and custom task types. 
Prerequisites
To create and start a human loop, the AmazonAugmentedAIFullAccess policy must be attached to the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role that configures or starts the human loop. This will be the identity that you use to configure the human loop using HumanLoopConfig for built-in task types. For custom task types, this will be the identity that you use to call StartHumanLoop.
Additionally, when using a built-in task type, your IAM user or role must have permission to invoke API operations of the AWS service associated with your task type. For example, if using Amazon Rekognition with Augmented AI, you must attach permissions required to call DetectModerationLabels. For examples of identity-based policies you can use to grant these permissions, see Amazon Rekognition Identity-Based Policy Examples and Amazon Textract Identity-Based Policy Examples. You can also use the more general policy AmazonAugmentedAIIntegratedAPIAccess to grant these permissions. For more information, see Create an IAM User With Permissions to Invoke Amazon A2I, Amazon Textract, and Amazon Rekognition API Operations. 
To create and start a human loop, you will need a flow definition ARN. To learn how to create a flow definition (or human review workflow), see Create a Flow Definition.
Create and Start a Human Loop for a Built-in Task Type
To start a human loop for a built-in task type jobs use the corresponding service's API to provide your input data and to configure the human loop. For Amazon Textract, you use the AnalyzeDocument API operation. For Amazon Rekognition, you use the DetectModerationLabels API operation. You can use the AWS CLI, or a language-specific SDK to create requests using these API operations. 
After you start your ML job using your built-in task type's AWS service API, Amazon A2I monitors the inference-results of that service. For example, when running a job with Amazon Rekognition, Amazon A2I checks the inference confidence score for each image and compares it to the confidence-thresholds specified in your flow definition. If the conditions to start a human review task are satisfied, or if you didn't specify conditions in your flow definition, a human review task is sent to workers. 
Create an Amazon Textract Human Loop
Amazon A2I integrates with Amazon Textract so that you can configure and start a human loop using the Amazon Textract API. To send a document file to Amazon Textract for text analysis, you use the Amazon Textract AnalyzeDocument API operation. To configure a human loop, set the HumanLoopConfig parameter when you configure AnalyzeDocument. To learn how, see Step 3 in Running AnalyzeDocument with Amazon A2I (Preview) in the Amazon Textract Developer Guide. 
After you run the AnalyzeDocument with a human loop configured, Amazon A2I monitors the results from AnalyzeDocument and checks it against the flow definition's activation conditions. If Amazon Textract inference confidence score for one or more key value pairs meets the conditions for review, Amazon A2I starts a human review loop and includes the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/API_HumanLoopActivationOutput.html object in the AnalyzeDocument response.
Create an Amazon Rekognition Human Loop
Amazon A2I integrates with Amazon Rekognition so that you can configure and start a human loop using the Amazon Rekognition API. To send images to Amazon Rekognition for content moderation, you use the Amazon Rekognition DetectModerationLabels API operation. To configure a human loop, set the HumanLoopConfig parameter when you configure DetectModerationLabels. To learn how, see Step 3 in Running DetectModerationLabels with Amazon A2I in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. 
After you run the DetectModerationLabels with a human loop configured, Amazon A2I monitors the results from DetectModerationLabels and checks it against the flow definition's activation conditions. If the Amazon Rekognition inference confidence score for an image meets the conditions for review, Amazon A2I starts a human review loop and includes the response element HumanLoopActivationOutput response object in the DetectModerationLabels response.
Create and Start a Human Loop for a Custom Task Type
To configure a human loop for a custom human review task, use the StartHumanLoop operation within your application. This section provides an example of a human loop request using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For documentation on other language specific SDK's that support StartHumanLoop, use the See Also section of StartHumanLoop in the Amazon Augmented AI Runtime API documentation. 
Prerequisites
To complete this procedure, you need:
 Input data formatted as a string representation of a JSON-formatted file.
 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your flow definition
 A flow definition ARN. 
To configure the human loop

For DataAttributes, specify a set of ContentClassifiers related to the input provided to the StartHumanLoop operation. Use content classifiers to decalre that your content is free of personally identifiable information or adult content. 

To use Amazon Mechanical Turk, ensure your data is free of Personally Identifiable Information and include the FreeOfPersonallyIdentifiableInformation content classifier. If you data is free of adult content, also include the 'FreeOfAdultContent' classifier. If you do not use these content classifiers, SageMaker may restrict the Mechanical Turk workers that can view your task.


For FlowDefinitionArn, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your flow definition.


For HumanLoopInput, enter your input data as a string representation of a JSON-formatted file. Structure your input data and custom worker task template so that your input data is properly displayed to human workers when you start your human loop. See to learn how to preview your custom worker task template. 


For HumanLoopName, enter a name for the human loop. The name must be unique within the Region in your account, and can have up to 63 characters. Valid characters: a-z, 0-9, and - (hyphen).


To start a human loop
 To start a human loop, submit a request similar to the following examples using your preferred language specific SDK. 

[ AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) ]
The following request example uses the SDK for Python (Boto3). For more information, see Boto 3 Augmented AI Runtime in the AWS SDK for Python (Boto) API Reference.
response = client.start_human_loop(
    HumanLoopName='string',
    FlowDefinitionArn='string',
    HumanLoopInput={
        'InputContent': 'string'
    },
    DataAttributes={
        'ContentClassifiers': [
            'FreeOfPersonallyIdentifiableInformation'|'FreeOfAdultContent',
        ]
    }
)

[ AWS CLI ]
The following request example uses the AWS CLI. For more information, see start-human-loop in the AWS CLI Command Reference. 
$ InputContent=string
ContentClassifiers="FreeOfPersonallyIdentifiableInformation","FreeOfAdultContent" 
start-human-loop --human-loop-name example-humanloop 
                 --flow-definition-arn arn:aws:sagemaker:us-west-2:111111111111:flow-definition/flowdef-nov-12  
                 --human-loop-input InputContent 
                 --data-attributes ContentClassifiers

When you successfully start a human loop by invoking StartHumanLoop directly, the response will include a HumanLoopARN and a HumanLoopActivationResults object which will be set to NULL. You can use this the human loop name to monitor and manage your human loop.
Next Steps:
After starting a human loop, you can manage and monitor it with the Amazon Augmented AI Runtime API and Amazon CloudWatch Events. To learn more, see Monitor and Manage Your Human Loop.
