The sections here explain how to use the console to create a labeling job, assign a public or private workforce, and send the labeling job to your workforce. You can also learn how to monitor the progress of a labeling job.
If you want to create a custom labeling job, see Creating Custom Labeling Workflows for instructions.
Before you create a labeling job, you must upload your dataset to an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Use Input and Output Data.
