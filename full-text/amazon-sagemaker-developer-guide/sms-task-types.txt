Built-in Task Types
Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth has several built-in task types. These are image- and text-based labeling jobs that use Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms. Ground Truth provides worker task templates in the console for built-in task types. The following topics describe each built-in task type and demo the worker task templates that are provided by Ground Truth in the console. To learn how to create a labeling job in the console using one of these task types, select the task type page. If you are a new user of Ground Truth, we recommend that you use the Getting started bounding box demo to learn how to create a labeling job using the SageMaker console.
