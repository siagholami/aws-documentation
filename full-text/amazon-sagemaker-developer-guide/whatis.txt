What Is Amazon SageMaker?
Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. It provides an integrated Jupyter authoring notebook instance for easy access to your data sources for exploration and analysis, so you don't have to manage servers. It also provides common machine learning algorithms that are optimized to run efficiently against extremely large data in a distributed environment. With native support for bring-your-own-algorithms and frameworks, SageMaker offers flexible distributed training options that adjust to your specific workflows. Deploy a model into a secure and scalable environment by launching it with a few clicks from SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker console. Training and hosting are billed by minutes of usage, with no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.
This guide includes information and tutorials on SageMaker features. To learn how to build, train, and deploy models using SageMaker, see Amazon SageMaker developer resources. 
Amazon SageMaker Features
Amazon SageMaker includes the following features:
Amazon SageMaker Studio
An integrated machine learning environment where you can build, train, deploy, and analyze your models all in the same application.
Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth
High-quality training datasets by using workers along with machine learning to create labeled datasets.
Amazon Augmented AI
Human-in-the-loop reviews
Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks
The next generation of SageMaker notebooks that include SSO integration, fast start-up times, and single-click sharing.
Preprocessing
Analyze and pre-process data, tackle feature engineering, and evaluate models.
Amazon SageMaker Experiments
Experiment management and tracking. You can use the tracked data to reconstruct an experiment, incrementally build on experiments conducted by peers, and trace model lineage for compliance and audit verifications.
Amazon SageMaker Debugger
Inspect training parameters and data throughout the training process. Automatically detect and alert users to commonly occurring errors such as parameter values getting too large or small.
Amazon SageMaker Autopilot
Users without machine learning knowledge can quickly build classification and regression models.
Reinforcement Learning
Maximize the long-term reward that an agent receives as a result of its actions.
Batch Transform
Preprocess datasets, run inference when you don't need a persistent endpoint, and associate input records with inferences to assist the interpretation of results.
Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor
Monitor and analyze models in production (endpoints) to detect data drift and deviations in model quality.
Amazon SageMaker Neo
Train machine learning models once, then run anywhere in the cloud and at the edge.
Amazon SageMaker Elastic Inference
Speed up the throughput and decrease the latency of getting real-time inferences.
Amazon SageMaker Pricing
As with other AWS products, there are no contracts or minimum commitments for using Amazon SageMaker. For more information about the cost of using SageMaker, see Amazon SageMaker Pricing.
