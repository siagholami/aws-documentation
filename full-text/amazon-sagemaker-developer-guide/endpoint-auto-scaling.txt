Automatically Scale Amazon SageMaker Models
Amazon SageMaker supports automatic scaling (autoscaling) for your hosted models. Autoscaling dynamically adjusts the number of instances provisioned for a model in response to changes in your workload. When the workload increases, autoscaling brings more instances online. When the workload decreases, autoscaling removes unnecessary instances so that you don't pay for provisioned instances that you aren't using.
