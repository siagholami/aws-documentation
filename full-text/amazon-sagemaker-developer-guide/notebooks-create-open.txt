Create or Open an Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebook
When you create a notebook in Amazon SageMaker Studio or open a non-shared notebook in Studio for the first time, you have to select a SageMaker image and kernel for the notebook. SageMaker launches the notebook on a default instance of a type based on the chosen SageMaker image. For CPU based images, the default instance type is ml.t3.medium (available as part of the AWS Free Tier). For GPU based images, the default instance type is ml.g4dn.xlarge.
If you create or open additional notebooks that use the same instance type, whether or not the notebooks use the same kernel, the notebooks run on the same instance of that instance type.
After a notebook is launched, you can change its instance type, and SageMaker image and kernel from within the notebook. For more information, see Change an Instance Type and Change an Amazon SageMaker Image.
You can have one instance of each instance type. Each instance can have only one SageMaker image running on it at a time. However, a SageMaker image can run multiple kernels or terminal instances. 
Billing occurs per instance and starts when the first instance of a given instance type is launched. If you want to create or open a notebook without the risk of incurring charges, open the notebook from the File menu and choose No Kernel from the Select Kernel dialog. You can read and edit a notebook without a running kernel but you can't run cells.
Billing ends when the SageMaker image for the instance is shut down. For more information, see Usage Metering.
For information on shutting down the notebook, see Shut Down Sessions and Images.
