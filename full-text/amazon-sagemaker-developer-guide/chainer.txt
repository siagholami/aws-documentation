Use Chainer with Amazon SageMaker
You can use SageMaker to train and deploy a model using custom Chainer code. The SageMaker Python SDK Chainer estimators and models and the SageMaker open-source Chainer container make writing a Chainer script and running it in SageMaker easier.
What do you want to do?
I want to train a custom Chainer model in SageMaker.
For a sample Jupyter notebook, see the Chainer example notebooks in the Amazon SageMaker Examples GitHub repository.
For documentation, see Train a Model with Chainer.
I have a Chainer model that I trained in SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a hosted endpoint.
For more information, see Deploy Chainer models.
I have a Chainer model that I trained outside of SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a SageMaker endpoint
For more information, see Deploy Endpoints from Model Data.
I want to see the API documentation for Amazon SageMaker Python SDK Chainer classes.
For more information, see Chainer Classes.
I want to find information about SageMaker Chainer containers.
For more information, see the SageMaker Chainer Container GitHub repository.
For information about supported Chainer versions, and for general information about writing Chainer training scripts and using Chainer estimators and models with SageMaker, see Using Chainer with the SageMaker Python SDK.
