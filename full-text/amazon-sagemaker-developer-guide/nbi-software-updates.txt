Notebook Instance Software Updates
Amazon SageMaker periodically tests and releases software that is installed on notebook instances. This includes:
 Kernel updates
 Security patches
 AWS SDK updates
 Amazon SageMaker Python SDK updates
 Open source software updates
SageMaker does not automatically update software on a notebook instance when it is in service. To ensure that you have the most recent software updates, stop and restart your notebook instance, either in the SageMaker console or by calling â€¨ StopNotebookInstance.
You can also manually update software installed on your notebook instance while it is running by using update commands in a terminal or in a notebook.
Note
Updating kernels and some packages might depend on whether root access is enabled for the notebook instance. For more information, see Control Root Access to a Notebook Instance.
Notebook instances do not notify you if you are running outdated software. You can check the Personal Health Dashboard or the security bulletin at https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/  for updates.
