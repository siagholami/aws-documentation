crowd-entity-annotation
A widget for labeling words, phrases, or character strings within a longer text. Workers select a label, and highlight the text that the label applies to. 
Important: Self-contained Widget
Do not use <crowd-entity-annotation> element with the <crowd-form> element. It contains its own form submission logic and Submit button.
The following is an example of a template that uses the <crowd-entity-annotation> element. Copy the following code and save it in a file with the extenion .html. Open the file in any browser to preview and interact with this template. 
```

<crowd-entity-annotation
  name="crowd-entity-annotation"
  header="Highlight parts of the text below"
  labels="[{'label': 'person', 'shortDisplayName': 'per', 'fullDisplayName': 'Person'}, {'label': 'date', 'shortDisplayName': 'dat', 'fullDisplayName': 'Date'}, {'label': 'company', 'shortDisplayName': 'com', 'fullDisplayName': 'Company'}]"
  text="Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth helps you build highly accurate training datasets for machine learning quickly."



Read the text carefully.
Highlight words, phrases, or sections of the text.
Choose the label that best matches what you have highlighted.
To change a label, choose highlighted text and select a new label.
To remove a label from highlighted text, choose the X next to the abbreviated label name on the highlighted text.
You can select all of a previously highlighted text, but not a portion of it.




    Apply labels to words or phrases.
  
<div id="additionalQuestions" style="margin-top: 20px">
  <h3>
    What is the overall subject of this text?
  </h3>
  <crowd-radio-group>
    <crowd-radio-button name="tech" value="tech">Technology</crowd-radio-button>
    <crowd-radio-button name="politics" value="politics">Politics</crowd-radio-button>
  </crowd-radio-group>
</div>



  document.addEventListener('all-crowd-elements-ready', () => {
    document
      .querySelector('crowd-entity-annotation')

      .querySelector('crowd-form')
      .form

Attributes
The following attributes are supported by this element.
header
The text to display above the image. This is typically a question or simple instruction for the worker.
initial-value
A JSON formatted array of objects, each of which defines an annotation to apply to the text at initialization. Objects contain a label value that matches one in the labels attribute, an integer startOffset value for labeled span's starting unicode offset, and an integer endOffset value for the ending unicode offset.
Example 
[
  {
    label: 'person',
    startOffset: 0,
    endOffset: 16
  },
  ...
]
labels
A JSON formatted array of objects, each of which contains:
 label (required): The name used to identify entities.
 fullDisplayName (optional): Used for the label list in the task widget. Defaults to the label value if not specified.
 shortDisplayName (optional): An abbreviation of 3-4 letters to display above selected entities. Defaults to the label value if not specified.
shortDisplayName is highly recommended
Values displayed above the selections can overlap and create difficulty managing labeled entities in the workspace. Providing a 3-4 character shortDisplayName for each label is highly recommended to prevent overlap and keep the workspace manageable for your workers.
Example 
[
  {
    label: 'person',
    shortDisplayName: 'per', 
    fullDisplayName: 'person'
  }
]
name
Serves as the widget's name in the DOM. It is also used as the label attribute name in form output and the output manifest.
text
The text to be annotated. The templating system escapes quotes and HTML strings by default. If your code is already escaped or partially escaped, see Variable filters for more ways to control escaping.
