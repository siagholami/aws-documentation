Use Apache MXNet with Amazon SageMaker
You can use SageMaker to train and deploy a model using custom MXNet code. The Amazon SageMaker Python SDK MXNet estimators and models and the SageMaker open-source MXNet container make writing a MXNet script and running it in SageMaker easier.
What do you want to do?
I want to train a custom MXNet model in SageMaker.
For a sample Jupyter notebook, see the MXNet example notebooks in the Amazon SageMaker Examples GitHub repository.
For documentation, see Train a Model with MXNet.
I have an MXNet model that I trained in SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a hosted endpoint.
For more information, see Deploy MXNet models.
I have an MXNet model that I trained outside of SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a SageMaker endpoint
For more information, see Deploy Endpoints from Model Data.
I want to see the API documentation for Amazon SageMaker Python SDK MXNet classes.
For more information, see MXNet Classes. 
I want to find the SageMaker MXNet container repository.
For more information, see SageMaker MXNet Container GitHub repository.
I want to find information about MXNet versions supported by AWS Deep Learning Containers.
For more information, see Available Deep Learning Container Images.
