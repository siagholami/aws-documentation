Delete a scaling policy (AWS CLI or Application Auto Scaling API)
You can use the AWS CLI or the Application Auto Scaling API to delete a scaling policy from a variant.
Delete a scaling policy (AWS CLI)
To delete a scaling policy from a variant, use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/application-autoscaling/delete-scaling-policy.html AWS CLI command with the following parameters:
 --policy-name—The name of the scaling policy.
 --resource-id—The resource identifier for the variant. For this parameter, the resource type is endpoint and the unique identifier is the name of the variant. For example, endpoint/MyEndpoint/variant/MyVariant.
 --service-namespace—Set this value to sagemaker.
 --scalable-dimension—Set this value to sagemaker:variant:DesiredInstanceCount.
Example
The following example deletes a target-tracking scaling policy named myscalablepolicy from a variant named myscalablevariant.  
aws application-autoscaling delete-scaling-policy \
    --policy-name myscalablepolicy \
    --resource-id endpoint/MyEndpoint/variant/MyVariant \
    --service-namespace sagemaker \
    --scalable-dimension sagemaker:variant:DesiredInstanceCount
Delete a scaling policy (Application Auto Scaling API)
To delete a scaling policy from your variant, use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DeleteScalingPolicy.html Application Auto Scaling API action with the following parameters:
 PolicyName—The name of the scaling policy.
 ServiceNamespace—Set this value to sagemaker.
 ResourceID—The resource identifier for the variant. For this parameter, the resource type is endpoint and the unique identifier is the name of the variant,. For example, endpoint/MyEndpoint/variant/MyVariant.
 ScalableDimension—Set this value to sagemaker:variant:DesiredInstanceCount.
Example
The following example uses the Application Auto Scaling API to delete a target-tracking scaling policy named myscalablepolicy from a variant named myscalablevariant.
