For Authentication method, choose AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).


Under Permission, for Execution role for all users, choose an option from the role selector.


If you choose Create a new role, the Create an IAM role dialog opens:
    For S3 buckets you specify, specify additional S3 buckets that users of your notebooks can access. If you don't want to add access to more buckets, choose None.
    Choose Create role. SageMaker creates a new IAM AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionPolicy role with the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess policy attached.

Choose Submit.

On the Amazon SageMaker Studio Control Panel, under Studio Summary, wait for Status to change to Ready and the Add user button to be enabled.

Choose Submit. The Amazon SageMaker Studio Control Panel opens with the new user listed. The Delete user button and the Open Studio link are both enabled.


To add more users, repeat steps 7 through 9.
