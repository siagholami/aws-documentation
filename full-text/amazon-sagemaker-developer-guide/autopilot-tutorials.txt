Tutorials: Get started with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot
Autopilot get started tutorials demonstrate how to create a machine learning model automatically without having to write code. They show you how Autopilot simplifies the machine learning experience by helping you explore your data and try different algorithms. Autopilot builds the best machine learning model for the problem type using AutoML capabilities while allowing full control and visibility. 
 Create a machine learning model automatically with Autopilot: You assume the role of a developer working at a bank in this tutorial. You have been asked to develop a machine learning model to predict whether or not a customer will enroll for a certificate of deposit (CD). This is a binary classification problem. The model is trained on the marketing dataset that contains information on customer demographics, responses to marketing events, and external factors.
