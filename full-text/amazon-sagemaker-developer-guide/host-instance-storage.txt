Host Instance Storage Volumes
When you create an endpoint, Amazon SageMaker attaches an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage volume to Amazon EC2 instances that hosts the endpoint. The size of the storage volume is scalable, and storage options are divided into two categories: SSD-backed storage and HDD-backed storage. 
For more information about Amazon EBS storages and features, see the following pages.
