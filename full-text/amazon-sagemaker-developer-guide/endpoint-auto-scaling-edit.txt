Edit a scaling policy
You can edit an autoscaling policy with the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Application Auto Scaling API. 
Scale-in
If a modelâ€™s traffic becomes zero, Amazon SageMaker automatic scaling doesn't scale-in. This is because SageMaker doesn't emit metrics with a value of zero, and without a metric, the scaling policy will never be triggered.
As a workaround, do either of the following:
 Send requests to the model variant until autoscaling scales-in to the minimum capacity
 Change the policy to reduce the maximum provisioned capacity to match the minimum provisioned capacity
Disable scale-in activity
You can prevent the target-tracking scaling policy configuration from scaling in your variant by disabling scale-in activity. Disabling scale-in activity prevents the scaling policy from deleting instances, while still allowing it to create them as needed.
To enable or disable scale-in activity for your model, specify a Boolean value for DisableScaleIn. For more information about DisableScaleIn, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration.html in the Application Auto Scaling API Reference. 
Example
The following is an example of a target-tracking configuration for a scaling policy where it will scale-out, but not scale-in. In this configuration, the SageMakerVariantInvocationsPerInstance predefined metric will scale-out based on an average of 70 invocations (inference requests) across all instances the model is on. The configuration also disables scale-in activity for the scaling policy.  
{
    "TargetValue": 70.0,
    "PredefinedMetricSpecification":
    {
        "PredefinedMetricType": "SageMakerVariantInvocationsPerInstance"
    },
    "DisableScaleIn": true
}
Scale-out
To manually scale-out, adjust the minimum capacity. You can use the console to update this value. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI with the --min-capacity argument, or use the Application Auto Scaling API's MinCapacity parameter.
Disable scale-out activity
To prevent scale-out, adjust the maximum capacity. You can use the console to update this value. Alternatively, use the AWS CLI with the --max-capacity argument, or use the Application Auto Scaling API's MaxCapacity parameter.
Edit a scaling policy (Console)
To edit a scaling policy with the AWS Management Console, use the same procedure that you used to Configure model autoscaling with the console.
Edit a scaling policy (AWS CLI or Application Auto Scaling API)
You can use the AWS CLI or the Application Auto Scaling API to edit a scaling policy in the same way that you apply a scaling policy:
 With the AWS CLI, specify the name of the policy that you want to edit in the --policy-name parameter. Specify new values for the parameters that you want to change.
 With the Application Auto Scaling API, specify the name of the policy that you want to edit in the PolicyName parameter. Specify new values for the parameters that you want to change.
