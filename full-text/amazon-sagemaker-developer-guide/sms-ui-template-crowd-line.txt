crowd-line
A widget for drawing lines on an image. Each line is associated with a label, and output data will report the starting and ending points of each line. 
The following is an example of a Liquid template that uses the <crowd-line> element. Copy the following code and save it in a file with the extenion .html. Open the file in any browser to preview and interact with this template. For more examples, see this GitHub repository. 
```


  <crowd-line
    name="crowdLine"
    src="{{ task.input.taskObject | grant_read_access }}"
    header="Add header here to describe the task"
    labels="['car','pedestrian','street car']"

<short-instructions>
    <p>Read the task carefully and inspect the image.</p>
    <p>Choose the appropriate label that best suits the image.</p>
    <p>Draw a line on each objects that the label applies to.</p>
</short-instructions>


<full-instructions>
    <p>Read the task carefully and inspect the image.</p>
    <p>Choose the appropriate label that best suits the image. 
    <p>Draw a line along each object that the image applies to.
        Make sure that the line does not extend beyond the boundaries
        of the object.
    </p>
    <p>Each line is defined by a starting and ending point. Carefully
    place the starting and ending points on the boundaries of the object.</p>
</full-instructions>

Attributes
The following attributes are supported by this element.
header
Optional. The text to display above the image. This is typically a question or simple instruction for the worker.
initial-value
Optional. An array of JSON objects, each of which sets a line when the component is loaded. Each JSON object in the array contains the following properties:
 label – The text assigned to the line as part of the labeling task. This text must match one of the labels defined in the labels attribute of the <crowd-line> element.
 vertices – the x and y pixel corrdinates of the start point and end point of the line, relative to the top-left corner of the image.
initial-value="{
    lines: [
    {
        label: 'sideline', // label of this line annotation
        vertices:[         // an array of vertices which decide the position of the line
        {
            x: 84,
            y: 110
        },
        {
            x: 60,
            y: 100
        }
        ]
    },
    {
        label: 'yardline',
        vertices:[       
        {
            x: 651,
            y: 498
        },
        {
            x: 862,
            y: 869
        }
        ]
    }
   ]
}"
Lines set via the initial-value property can be adjusted. Whether or not a worker answer was adjusted is tracked via an initialValueModified boolean in the worker answer output.
labels
Required. A JSON formatted array of strings, each of which is a label that a worker can assign to the line. 
Limit: 10 labels
label-colors
Optional. An array of strings. Each string is a hexadecimal (hex) code for a label.
name
Required. The name of this widget. It's used as a key for the widget's input in the form output.
src
Required. The URL of the image on which to draw lines. 
Regions
The following regions are required by this element.
full-instructions
General instructions about how to draw lines. 
short-instructions
Important task-specific instructions that are displayed in a prominent place.
Element Hierarchy
This element has the following parent and child elements.
 Parent elements: crowd-form
 Child elements: short-instructions, full-instructions
Output
inputImageProperties
A JSON object that specifies the dimensions of the image that is being annotated by the worker. This object contains the following properties.
 height – The height, in pixels, of the image.
 width – The width, in pixels, of the image.
lines
A JSON Array containing objects with the line labels and vertices.
 label – The label given to a line.
 vertices – the x and y pixel corrdinates of the start point and end point of the line, relative to the top-left corner of the image.
