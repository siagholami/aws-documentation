Step 4: Download, Explore, and Transform the Training Data
Download the MNIST dataset to your notebook instance, review the data, transform it, and upload it to your S3 bucket. 
You transform the data by changing its format from numpy.array to comma-separated values (CSV). The XGBoost Algorithm expects input in either the LIBSVM or CSV format. LIBSVM is an open source machine learning library. In this exercise , you use CSV format because it's simpler.
