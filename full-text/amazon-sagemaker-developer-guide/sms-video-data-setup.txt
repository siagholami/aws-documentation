Input Data Setup
When you create a video frame labeling job, you need to let Ground Truth know where to look for your input data. You can do this in one of two ways:
 You can store your input data in Amazon S3 and have Ground Truth automatically detect the input dataset used for your labeling job. See Automated Video Frame Input Data Setup to learn more about this option. 
 You can create an input manifest file and sequence files and upload them to Amazon S3. See Manual Input Data Setup to learn more about this option.
