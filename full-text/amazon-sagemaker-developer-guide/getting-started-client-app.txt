Step 8: Integrating Amazon SageMaker Endpoints into Internet-facing Applications
In a production environment, you might have an internet-facing application sending requests to the endpoint for inference. The following high-level example shows how to integrate your model endpoint into your application.
For an example of how to use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda to set up and deploy a web service that you can call from a client application, see Call a SageMaker model endpoint using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda in the AWS Machine Learning Blog.


Create an IAM role that the AWS Lambda service principal can assume. Give the role permissions to call the Amazon SageMaker InvokeEndpoint API.


Create a Lambda function that calls the SageMaker InvokeEndpoint API.


Call the Lambda function from a mobile application. For an example of how to call a Lambda function from a mobile application using Amazon Cognito for credentials, see Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda as Mobile Application Backend.
