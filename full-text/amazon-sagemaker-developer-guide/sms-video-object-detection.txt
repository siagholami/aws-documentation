Video Frame Object Detection
You can use the video frame object detection task type to have workers identify and locate objects in a sequence of video frames (images extracted from a video) using bounding boxes. For example, you can use this task to ask workers to identify and localize various objects in a series of video frames, such as cars, bikes, and pedestrians.
A bounding box is a box that is associated with a label and is drawn around an object to identify the pixel location of the object. You provide a list of categories, and workers can select one category at a time and draw bounding boxes around objects to which the category applies in all frames.
You can create a video frame object detection labeling job using the Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth console, the SageMaker API, and language-specific AWS SDKs. To learn more, see Create a Video Frame Object Detection Labeling Job and select your preferred method. 
Ground Truth provides a worker UI and tools to complete your labeling job tasks: Preview the Worker UI.
You can create a job to adjust annotations created in a video object detection labeling job using the video object detection adjustment task type. To learn more, see Create an Adjustment Labeling Job.
Preview the Worker UI
Ground Truth provides workers with a web user interface (UI) to complete your video frame object detection annotation tasks. You can preview and interact with the worker UI when you create a labeling job in the console. If you are a new user, we recommend that you create a labeling job through the console using a small input dataset to preview the worker UI and ensure your video frames, labels, and label attributes appear as expected. 
The UI provides workers with labeling tools to complete your object detection tasks. Workers can use a Predict next feature to draw a bounding box in a single frame, and then have Ground Truth predict the location of boxes with the same label in all other frames. Workers can then make adjustments to correct predicted box locations. 
The following video shows how a worker might use the worker UI and tools to complete your object detection tasks.

Create a Video Frame Object Detection Labeling Job
You can create a video frame object detection labeling job using the SageMaker console or the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLabelingJob.html API operation. 
This section assumes that you have reviewed the Video Frame Labeling Job Overview and have chosen the type of input data and the input dataset connection you are using. 
Create a Labeling Job (Console)
Follow the instructions in Create a Labeling Job (Console) to learn how to create a video frame object detection job in the SageMaker console. For this task type, do the following: 
 When choosing your task type, choose Video from the Task category dropdown list, and choose Video multi-frame object detection as the task type. 
 If you set your take time limit to be greater than 8 hours, you must set MaxSessionDuration for your IAM execution role to at least 8 hours. To see how to update this value for your IAM role in the IAM console, see Modifying a Role Maximum Session Duration (Console) in the IAM User Guide.
Create a Labeling Job (API)
You create an object detection labeling job using the SageMaker API operation CreateLabelingJob. This API defines this operation for all AWS SDKs. To see a list of language-specific SDKs supported for this operation, review the See Also section of https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLabelingJob.html. 
Create a Labeling Job (API) provides an overview of the CreateLabelingJob operation. Follow these instructions and do the following while you configure your request: 
 You must enter an ARN for HumanTaskUiArn. Use arn:aws:sagemaker:<region>:394669845002:human-task-ui/VideoObjectDetection. Replace <region> with the AWS Region in which you are creating the labeling job. 
Do not include an entry for the UiTemplateS3Uri parameter. 
 Your https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLabelingJob.html#sagemaker-CreateLabelingJob-request-LabelAttributeName must end in -ref. For example, video-od-labels-ref. 
 Your input manifest file must be a video frame sequence manifest file. You can create this manifest file using the SageMaker console, or create it manually and upload it to Amazon S3. For more information, see Input Data Setup. 
 You can only use private or vendor work teams to create video frame object detection labeling jobs. 
 You specify your labels and worker instructions in a label category configuration file. For more information, see Create a Labeling Category Configuration File with Label Category Attributes to learn how to create this file. 
 You need to provide pre-defined ARNs for the pre-annotation and post-annotation (ACS) Lambda functions. These ARNs are specific to the AWS Region you use to create your labeling job. 
   To find the pre-annotation Lambda ARN, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_HumanTaskConfig.html#sagemaker-Type-HumanTaskConfig-PreHumanTaskLambdaArn. Use the Region in which you are creating your labeling job to find the correct ARN that ends with PRE-VideoObjectDetection. 
   To find the post-annotation Lambda ARN, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AnnotationConsolidationConfig.html#sagemaker-Type-AnnotationConsolidationConfig-AnnotationConsolidationLambdaArn. Use the Region in which you are creating your labeling job to find the correct ARN that ends with ACS-VideoObjectDetection. 
 The number of workers specified in NumberOfHumanWorkersPerDataObject must be 1. 
 Automated data labeling is not supported for 3D point cloud labeling jobs. Do not specify values for parameters in [LabelingJobAlgorithmsConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLabelingJob.html#sagemaker-CreateLabelingJob-request-LabelingJobAlgorithmsConfig). 
 3D point cloud object tracking labeling jobs can take multiple hours to complete. You can specify a longer time limit for these labeling jobs in TaskTimeLimitInSeconds (up to 7 days, or 604,800 seconds). 
Important
If you set your take time limit to be greater than 8 hours, you must set MaxSessionDuration for your IAM execution role to at least 8 hours. To see how to update this value for your IAM role, see Modifying a Role  in the IAM User Guide, choose your preferred method to modify the role, and then follow the steps in Modifying a Role Maximum Session Duration. 
The following is an example of an AWS Python SDK (Boto3) request to create a labeling job in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.

Create an Adjustment Labeling Job
Use the video frame object detection adjustment task type to have workers adjust labels from a video frame object detection labeling job. You can create an adjustment labeling job in the console by chaining a successfully completed object tracking labeling job. To learn more, see Start an Label Adjustment Job (Console).
Output Data Format
When you create a video frame object detection labeling job, tasks are sent to workers. When these workers complete their tasks, labels are written to the Amazon S3 output location you specified when you created the labeling job. To learn about the video frame object detection output data format, see Video Frame Object Detection Output. If you are a new user of Ground Truth, see Output Data to learn more about the Ground Truth output data format.
