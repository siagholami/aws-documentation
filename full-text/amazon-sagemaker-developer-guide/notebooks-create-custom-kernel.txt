Create a Custom Kernel
You can create a custom kernel in any of the SageMaker images. The kernel will display in the Amazon SageMaker Studio Launcher when the SageMaker image that hosts the kernel is chosen. The kernel will also display in the Select Kernel dialog when changing a notebook's kernel.
Conda must be installed in the SageMaker image in order to create the kernel. The Data Science SageMaker image comes with Conda preinstalled. To create a kernel in any of the other SageMaker images, you must first install Conda. For more information, see Conda Installation.
A kernel is defined by a Conda environment. For more information about Conda environments, see Managing environments.
To create a custom kernel


Choose File and then New Launcher (Ctrl  Shift  L).


From the Studio Launcher, choose the SageMaker image that will host the kernel.


Choose Image Terminal.


The terminal opens inside the chosen SageMaker image.

If the chosen SageMaker image doesn't have Conda installed, run the following command to install Conda.

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /tmp/miniconda3

Run the following command to create the kernel. We're showing IPython as it's available on all Jupyter notebooks. Refer to the Conda create documentation for other options.

conda create --name KernelName ipykernel
You can use the --yes option to ignore the package installation confirmation.
Note
You don't need to activate the kernel after creating it.
The kernel isn't persisted when the SageMaker image hosting the kernel is shutdown. To save the kernel, export the kernel as a YML file and save the file to your Amazon EFS volume.
To export and recreate a custom kernel

Run the following command to export the kernel as a YML file.

conda env export --name KernelName --file ~/KernelFileName.yml

Run the following command to recreate the kernel from the YML file.

conda env create --file ~/KernelFileName.yml
