Getting started with a Microsoft OneDrive for Business data source (Console)
You can use the Amazon Kendra console to get started indexing a Microsoft OneDrive for Business site. When you use the console you can specify all of the connection information that you need to index the contents of a OneDrive site. For more information, see Using a Microsoft OneDrive data source.
Use the following procedure to create a basic OneDrive data source using the default configuration. The procedure assumes that you have already created an index following the steps in step 1 of Getting started with an S3 bucket (Console).
Before you can create a OneDrive data source, you must register an Azure Active Directory application. Use the following procedure to register the application.
Step 1: To register an Azure AD application


Log into the Azure Management Portal.


Choose Azure Active Directory and then choose App registrations


Choose New registration.


Create the application with the following values.
    Name Enter the name for your application.
    Application type Web app/API
    Sign-on URL Any valid URL. The URL doesn't need to exist.


Choose Register.


Choose the application name in the list of applications to open the application settings.


Choose Overview and then copy the Application ID value.


The application requires permission to access OneDrive data. Use the following procedure to assign permissions to the application. This procedure starts where the previous procedure left off.
Step 2: To assign permissions to the Azure AD application


From the application settings, choose API Permission.


Choose Add, and choose the Microsoft Graph option, and then choose Add.


From the Application permissions, choose the following.
    Read files in all site collections (Files.Read.All)
    Read all users' full profiles (User.Read.All)
    Read directory data (Directory.Read.All)
    Read all groups (Group.Read.All)
    Read items in all site collections (Sites.Read.All)


Choose Save and then choose Grant permissions. Choose Yes when prompted.


Next you create an application key that Amazon Kendra uses to identify itself with the OneDrive site. This procedure starts where the previous procedure left off.
Step 3: To create an application key


From the Application settings, choose Keys.


Add the following information to the key.
    Description Add a description for your key.
    Expires Choose a duration based on your company policy. When the application key is rotated, you must update the key in the Amazon Kendra data source.


Choose Save to generate the key value. Copy this value to use in the next step.


Once you have created the Azure AD application and generated a secret key for the application, you are ready to create a OneDrive data source.
Step 4: To create a OneDrive data source using the Amazon Kendra console


Sign into the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Kendra console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kendra/home.


From the list of indexes, choose the index that you want to add the data source to.


Choose Add data sources.


From the list of data source connectors, choose OneDrive.


On the Define attributes page, give your data source a name and optionally a description. Leave the Tags field blank. Choose Next to continue.


On the Define targets page, enter the domain name of your OneDrive site. Enter the name without the protocol ("https://").


In the IAM role field choose Create a new role. Enter a name for the role in the Role name field. Choose Next to continue.


In the Type of authentication field, choose New. This tells the console to create a new AWS Secrets Manager secret to contain credentials for your OneDrive data source.


In the New secret container name field enter a name to identify the Secrets Manager secret.


In the Application ID and Application password fields enter the ID and password for the Active Directory application that you created for the data source. Choose Save authentication to save the credentials for your OneDrive site.


In the Add OneDrive users section, choose Names list. Add the email addresses of up to 10 users whose documents you want to index.


In the Set sync run schedule section, choose Run on demand in the Frequency field.


In the OneDrive field mapping section, leave the default fields selected and then choose Next.


On the Review and create page review the details of your OneDrive data source. If you want to make changes, choose the Edit button next to the item that you want to change. When you are satisfied with your choices, choose Create to create your OneDrive data source.


After you choose Create, Amazon Kendra starts creating the data source. It can take several minutes for the data source to be created. When it is finished, the status of the data source changes from Creating to Active.
After creating the data source, you need to sync the Amazon Kendra index with the data source. Choose Sync now to start the sync process. It can take several minutes to several hours to synchronize the data source, depending on the number and size of the documents.
