Encryption at rest
Amazon Kendra encrypts your data at rest with your choice of an encryption key. You can choose one of the following:
 An AWS owned customer master key (CMK). If you don't specify an encryption key your data is encrypted with this key by default.
 An AWS managed CMK in your account. This key is created, managed, and used on your behalf by Amazon Kendra. The key name is aws/kendra.
 A customer managed CMK. You can provide the ARN of an encryption key that you created in your account. When you use a customer managed CMK, you must give the key a key policy that enables Amazon Kendra to use the key. Select a symmetric customer managed CMK, Amazon Kendra does not support asymmetric CMKs. For more information, see Key management.
