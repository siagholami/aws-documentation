Setting up the AWS CLI
The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified developer tool for managing AWS services, including Amazon Kendra. We recommend that you install it.


To install the AWS CLI, follow the instructions in Installing the AWS Command Line Interface in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. 


To configure the AWS CLI and set up a profile to call the AWS CLI, follow the instructions in Configuring the AWS CLI in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.


To confirm that the AWS CLI profile is configured properly, run the following command:


aws configure --profile default
If your profile has been configured correctly, you will see output similar to the following:
AWS Access Key ID [****************52FQ]: 
   AWS Secret Access Key [****************xgyZ]: 
   Default region name [us-west-2]: 
   Default output format [json]:

To verify that the AWS CLI is configured for use with Amazon Kendra, run the following commands:

aws kendra help
If the AWS CLI is configured correctly, you will see a list of the supported AWS CLI commands for Amazon Kendra, Amazon Kendra runtime, and Amazon Kendra events.
