Adding documents from a data source
When you create a data source, you give Amazon Kendra the location of documents that it should index. Unlike adding documents directly to an index, you can periodically scan the data source to update the index. 
For example, say that you have a repository of tax instruction stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Existing documents are changed and new documents are added to the repository from time to time. If you add the repository to Amazon Kendra as a data source, you can keep your index up to date by periodically updating your index.
You can update the index manually using console or the StartDataSourceSyncJob operation, or you can set up a schedule to update the index. 
An index can have more than one data source. Each data source can have its own update schedule. For example, you might update the index of your working documents daily, or even hourly, while updating your archived documents manually whenever the archive changes.
Setting an update schedule
Configure your data source to periodically update with the console or by using the Schedule parameter when you create or update a data source. The content of the parameter is a string that holds either a cron-format schedule string or an empty string to indicate that the index should be updated on demand. For the format of a cron expression, see Schedule Expressions for Rules in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide. Amazon Kendra supports only cron expressions, it does not support rate expressions.
