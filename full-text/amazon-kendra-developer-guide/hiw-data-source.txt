Data sources
A data source is a location, such as an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, where you store the documents for indexing. Data sources can be automatically synchronized with an Amazon Kendra index so that new, updated, or deleted documents in the source repositories are included in searches. Supported data sources are:
 Amazon S3 buckets
 Amazon RDS for MySQL and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL databases
 Microsoft OneDrive for Business
 Microsoft SharePoint Online
 Salesforce sites
 ServiceNow instances
Supported document formats are: plain text, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, HTML, and PDF. For more information, see Types of documents. 
Note
To create an index, you don't need a data source. You can add documents directly to an index. For more information, see Adding documents directly to an index.
