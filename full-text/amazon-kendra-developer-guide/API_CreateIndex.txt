CreateIndex
Creates a new Amazon Kendra index. Index creation is an asynchronous operation. To determine if index creation has completed, check the Status field returned from a call to DescribeIndex. The Status field is set to ACTIVE when the index is ready to use.
Once the index is active you can index your documents using the BatchPutDocument operation or using one of the supported data sources.
