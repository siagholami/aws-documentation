Rejecting a VPC Peering Connection
You can reject any VPC peering connection request that you've received that's in the pending-acceptance state. You should only accept VPC peering connections from AWS accounts that you know and trust; you can reject any unwanted requests.

Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Peering Connections.


Select the VPC peering connection, and choose Actions, Reject Request.


In the confirmation dialog box, choose Yes, Reject.
