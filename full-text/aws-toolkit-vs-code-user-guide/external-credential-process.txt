Using an external credential process
If you have a process to generate or lookup credentials that isn't directly supported by AWS, you can configure the AWS Toolkit for VS Code to use that process instead of any stored AWS credentials.
The method for specifying such an external credential process is the same as for the AWS CLI, and consists of adding a credential_process definition to your shared AWS conÔ¨Åg file. For detailed information about how to do this, see Sourcing Credentials with an External Process in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
