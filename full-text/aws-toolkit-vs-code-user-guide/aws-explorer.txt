Working with AWS Services in the AWS Explorer
The AWS Explorer gives you a view of some of the AWS services that you can work with when using the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code. See a high-level view of the AWS Explorer in the navigation topic.
This section provides information about how to access and use the AWS Explorer in VS Code. It assumes that you've already installed and configured the Toolkit for VS Code on your system.
Some important points:
 If the toolkit is installed and conÔ¨Ågured correctly, you should see items in the AWS Explorer. To see the AWS Explorer, choose the AWS icon in the Activity bar.
For example:

 Certain features require certain AWS permissions. For example, to see the AWS Lambda functions in your AWS account, the credentials you configured in Establishing credentials must include at least read-only Lambda permissions. See the following topics for more information about the permissions that each feature needs.
