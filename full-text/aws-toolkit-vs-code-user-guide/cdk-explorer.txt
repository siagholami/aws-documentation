Working with the AWS CDK Explorer









This is prerelease documentation for a feature in preview release. It is subject to change.



The AWS CDK Explorer enables you to work with AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) applications, or apps. You can find detailed information about the AWS CDK in the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) Developer Guide.
AWS CDK apps are composed of building blocks known as constructs, which include definitions for your AWS CloudFormation stacks and the AWS resources within them. Using the AWS CDK Explorer, you can visualize the stacks and resources that are defined in AWS CDK constructs. This visualization is provided in a tree view in an Explorer pane within the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor. See a high-level view of the AWS CDK Explorer in the navigation topic.
This section provides information about how to access and use the AWS CDK Explorer in the VS Code editor. It assumes that you've already installed and configured the Toolkit for VS Code on your system.
Note
You can disable the AWS CDK Explorer so that it isn't displayed in the VS Code editor. In the File menu, choose Preferences, Settings. Then enter "cdk" into the Search box and clear the Enable the AWS CDK Explorer box.
