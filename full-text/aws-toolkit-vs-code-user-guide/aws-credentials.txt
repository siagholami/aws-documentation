Using AWS-supported credentials
AWS credentials can be provided to the AWS Toolkit for VS Code by using your shared AWS conÔ¨Åg file or your shared AWS credentials file. The methods for using these files are the same as those for the AWS CLI. For general information about how to use these files, see Configuration and Credential Files in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
