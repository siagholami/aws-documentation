Viewing CloudWatch log groups and log streams by using the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code
A log stream is a sequence of log events that share the same source. Each separate source of logs into CloudWatch Logs makes up a separate log stream.
A log group is a group of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. You can define log groups and specify which streams to put into each group. There is no limit on the number of log streams that can belong to one log group. 
For more information, see Working with Log Groups and Log Streams  in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
