Deleting an AWS CloudFormation stack
You can use the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code to delete AWS CloudFormation stacks.
Prerequisites

Be sure your system meets the the prerequisites specified in Installing the Toolkit for VS Code.
Ensure that the credentials you configured in Establishing credentials include appropriate read/write access to the AWS CloudFormation service. If in the AWS Explorer, under CloudFormation, you see a message similar to "Error loading CloudFormation resources", check the permissions attached to those credentials. Changes that you make to permissions will take a few minutes to affect the AWS Explorer in VS Code.

In the AWS Explorer, open the context menu of the AWS CloudFormation stack you want to delete.



Choose Delete CloudFormation Stack.


In the message that appears, choose Yes to conÔ¨Årm the delete.
