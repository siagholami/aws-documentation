ConnectAsViewer
Connects as a viewer to the signaling channel specified by the endpoint. Any WebSocket-compliant library can be used to connect to the endpoint obtained from the GetSignalingEndpoint API call. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the signaling channel and the client ID must be provided as query string parameters. There are separate endpoints for connecting as a master and as a viewer. If there is an existing connection with the same ClientId as specified the request, the new connection takes precedence. The connection metadata is overwritten with the new information.
