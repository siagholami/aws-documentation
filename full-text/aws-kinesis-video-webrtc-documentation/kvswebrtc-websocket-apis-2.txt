ConnectAsMaster
Connects as a master to the signaling channel specified by the endpoint. Any WebSocket-complaint library can be used to connect to the endpoint obtained from a GetSignalingEndpoint API call. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the signaling channel must be provided as a query string parameter. There are separate endpoints for connecting as a master and as a viewer. If more than one client connects as master to a specific channel, then most recent request takes precedence. Existing connection metadata is overwritten by the new one.
