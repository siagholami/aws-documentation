Stream Live Media
The Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC includes the following SDKs:

Each SDK includes corresponding samples and step-by-step instructions that can help you build and run those applications. You can use these samples for low latency, live, two-way audio and video streaming and data exchange between any combinations of Web/Android/iOS applications or embedded devices. In other words, you can stream live audio and video from an embedded camera device to Android or web applications or between two Android applications.
