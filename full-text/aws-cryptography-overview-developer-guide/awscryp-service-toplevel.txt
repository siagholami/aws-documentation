AWS cryptographic services and tools
AWS's cryptographic services utilize a wide range of encryption and storage technologies that can assure the integrity of your data at rest or in transit. AWS offers several tools for cryptographic operations:
 AWS CloudHSM provides hardware security modules (HSMs) that can securely store a variety of cryptographic keys, including master keys and data keys.
 AWS Key Management Service (KMS) provides tools for generating master keys and other data keys. AWS KMS also interacts with many other AWS services to encrypt their service-specific data.
 AWS Encryption SDK provides a client-side encryption library for implementing encryption and decryption operations on all types of data.
 Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client provides a client-side encryption library for encrypting data tables before sending them to a database service, such as Amazon DynamoDB.
  AWS Secrets Manager provides encryption and rotation of encrypted secrets used with AWS-supported databases. 
Many AWS services rely on these cryptographic services during data transfer or storage. For a list of such services and an overview of how they use cryptographic practices, see Other AWS Services.
AWS cryptographic services comply with a wide range of cryptographic security standards, making it easy for you to protect your data without worrying about governmental or professional regulations. For a full list of AWS data security standard compliances, see AWS Compliance Programs.
