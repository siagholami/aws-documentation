AWS public key infrastructure (PKI) services and tools
AWS offers multiple PKI services that can help you easily and securely manage your certificate infrastructure. The primary AWS offerings for PKI are tightly linked:
 AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is used to generate, issue, and manage public and private SSL/TLS certificates for use with your AWS based websites and applications.
 AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (ACM PCA) is a managed private certificate authority (CA) service with which you can manage your CA infrastructure and your private certificates.
Many AWS services rely on these PKI services to authenticate the actors involved in a data transfer process. For a list of such services and an overview of how they use PKI practices, see Other AWS Services That Use SSL/TLS Certificates.
AWS PKI services comply with a wide range of security standards, making it easy for you to protect your data without worrying about governmental or professional regulations. For a full list of AWS data security standard compliances, see AWS Compliance Programs.
