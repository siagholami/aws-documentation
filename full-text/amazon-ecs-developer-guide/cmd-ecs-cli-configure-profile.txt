ecs-cli configure profile
Configures your AWS credentials in a named Amazon ECS profile, which is stored in the ~/.ecs/credentials file. If multiple profiles are created, you can change the profile used by default with the ecs-cli configure profile default command. For more information, see ecs-cli configure profile default.
Important
Some features described might only be available with the latest version of the Amazon ECS CLI. For more information about obtaining the latest version, see Installing the Amazon ECS CLI.
You can configure your AWS credentials in several ways:
 You can set the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN environment variables. When you run ecs-cli configure profile, the values of those variables are stored in the Amazon ECS CLI configuration file.
 You can pass credentials directly on the command line with the --access-key, --secret-key, and --session-token options. 
 You can provide the name of a new profile with the --profile-name flag. If a profile name is not provided, then the profile is named default.
 The first profile configured is set as the default profile. The Amazon ECS CLI uses credentials specified in this profile unless the --ecs-profile flag is used.
Working with Multiple Profiles
The following should be noted when using multiple profiles:
 Multiple profiles may be configured, but one is always the default. This profile is used when an Amazon ECS CLI command is run that requires credentials.
 The first profile that is created is set as the default profile.
 To change the default profile, use the ecs-cli configure profile default command. For more information, see ecs-cli configure profile default.
 A non-default profile can be referenced in a command using the --ecs-profile flag.
Syntax
ecs-cli configure profile --profile-name profile_name --access-key aws_access_key_id --secret-key aws_secret_access_key [--session-token token] [--help]
