Amazon ECS CloudWatch Events IAM Role
Before you can use Amazon ECS scheduled tasks with CloudWatch Events rules and targets, the CloudWatch Events service needs permissions to run Amazon ECS tasks on your behalf. These permissions are provided by the CloudWatch Events IAM role (ecsEventsRole).
The CloudWatch Events role is automatically created for you in the AWS Management Console when you configure a scheduled task. For more information, see Scheduled tasks (cron).
The AmazonEC2ContainerServiceEventsRole policy is shown below.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:RunTask"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "iam:PassedToService": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
If your scheduled tasks require the use of the task execution role, a task role, or a task role override, then you must add iam:PassRole permissions for each task execution role, task role, or task role override to the CloudWatch Events IAM role. For more information about the task execution role, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role.
Note
Specify the full ARN of your task execution role or task role override.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",

        {
            "Effect": "Allow",

            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/<ecsTaskExecutionRole_or_TaskRole_name>"
            ]

You can use the following procedure to check that your account already has the CloudWatch Events IAM role, and manually create it if needed.
