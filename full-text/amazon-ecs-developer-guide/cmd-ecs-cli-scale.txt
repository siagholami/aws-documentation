ecs-cli scale
Modifies the number of container instances in your cluster. This command changes the desired and maximum instance count in the Auto Scaling group created by the ecs-cli up command. You can use this command to scale out (increase the number of instances) or scale in (decrease the number of instances) your cluster.
Note
The Amazon ECS CLI can only manage tasks, services, and container instances that were created with the Amazon ECS CLI. To manage tasks, services, and container instances that weren't created by the Amazon ECS CLI, use the AWS Command Line Interface or the AWS Management Console.
Important
Some features described might only be available with the latest version of the Amazon ECS CLI. For more information about obtaining the latest version, see Installing the Amazon ECS CLI.
