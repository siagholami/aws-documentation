Updating a task definition
To update a task definition, create a task definition revision. If the task definition is used in a service, you must update that service to use the updated task definition.
To create a task definition revision


Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.


From the navigation bar, choose the region that contains your task definition.


In the navigation pane, choose task definitions.


On the task definitions page, select the box to the left of the task definition to revise and choose Create new revision.


On the Create new revision of task definition page, make changes. For example, to change the existing container definitions (such as the container image, memory limits, or port mappings), select the container, make the changes, and then choose Update.


Verify the information and choose Create.


If your task definition is used in a service, update your service with the updated task definition. For more information, see Updating a service.
