ecs-cli configure
Configures the AWS Region to use, resource creation prefixes, and the Amazon ECS cluster name to use with the Amazon ECS CLI. Stores a single named cluster configuration in the ~/.ecs/config file. The first cluster configuration that is created is set as the default.
Important
Some features described might only be available with the latest version of the Amazon ECS CLI. For more information about obtaining the latest version, see Installing the Amazon ECS CLI.
Working with Multiple Cluster Configurations
The following should be noted when using multiple cluster configurations:
 Multiple cluster configurations may be stored, but one is always the default.
 The first cluster configuration that is stored is set as the default.
 Use the ecs-cli configure default command to change which cluster configuration is set as the default. For more information, see ecs-cli configure default.
 A non-default cluster configuration can be referenced in a command by using the --cluster-config flag.
For more information, see ecs-cli configure default.
Note
Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Amazon ECS CLI to use all configuration options.

Examples
Example
This example configures the Amazon ECS CLI to create a cluster configuration named ecs-cli-demo, which uses FARGATE as the default launch type for cluster ecs-cli-demo in the us-east-1 region.
ecs-cli configure --region us-east-1 --cluster ecs-cli-demo --default-launch-type FARGATE --config-name ecs-cli-demo
Output:
INFO[0000] Saved ECS CLI cluster configuration ecs-cli-demo.
Contents of the ~/.ecs/config file after running the command:
version: v1
default: ecs-cli-demo
clusters:
  ecs-cli-demo:
    cluster: ecs-cli-demo
    region: us-east-1
    default_launch_type: FARGATE
