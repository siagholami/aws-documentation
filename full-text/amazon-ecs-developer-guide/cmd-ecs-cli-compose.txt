ecs-cli compose
Manage Amazon ECS tasks with docker-compose-style commands on an ECS cluster. For more information on how Docker Compose file syntax works with the Amazon ECS CLI, see Using Docker Compose File Syntax.
Note
To create Amazon ECS services with the Amazon ECS CLI, see ecs-cli compose service.
The ecs-cli compose command uses a project name with the task definitions and services it creates. When the CLI creates a task definition from a Compose file, the task definition is called project-name. When the CLI creates a service from a Compose file, the service is called service-project-name. By default, the project name is the name of the directory that contains your Docker Compose file. However, you can also specify your own project name with the --project-name option.
Note
The Amazon ECS CLI can only manage tasks, services, and container instances that were created with the Amazon ECS CLI. To manage tasks, services, and container instances that weren't created by the Amazon ECS CLI, use the AWS Command Line Interface or the AWS Management Console.
Important
Some features described might only be available with the latest version of the Amazon ECS CLI. For more information about obtaining the latest version, see Installing the Amazon ECS CLI.
