Managed Policies and Trust Relationships
Amazon ECS and Amazon ECR provide several managed policies and trust relationships that you can attach to IAM users, EC2 instances, and Amazon ECS tasks that allow differing levels of control over resources and API operations. You can apply these policies directly, or you can use them as starting points for creating your own policies.
