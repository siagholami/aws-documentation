Running tasks
Running tasks manually is ideal in certain situations. For example, suppose that you are developing a task but you are not ready to deploy this task with the service scheduler. Perhaps your task is a one-time or periodic batch job that does not make sense to keep running or restart when it finishes.
To keep a specified number of tasks running or to place your tasks behind a load balancer, use the Amazon ECS service scheduler instead. For more information, see Amazon ECS services.
