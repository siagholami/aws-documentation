ecs-cli ps
Lists all running containers in your Amazon ECS cluster.
The IP address displayed by the Amazon ECS CLI depends heavily upon how you have configured your task and cluster:
 For tasks using the EC2 launch type without task networking, the IP address shown is the public IP address of the Amazon EC2 instance running your task, or the instance private IP address if it lacks a public IP address.
 For tasks using the EC2 launch type with task networking, the ECS CLI only shows a private IP address obtained from the network interfaces section of the Describe Task output for the task.
 For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the Amazon ECS CLI returns the public IP address assigned to the elastic network instance attached to the Fargate task. If the elastic network instance lacks a public IP address, then the Amazon ECS CLI falls back to the private IP address obtained from the network interfaces section of the Describe Task output.
