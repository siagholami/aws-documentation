Agent introspection diagnostics
The Amazon ECS agent introspection API can provide helpful diagnostic information. For example, you can use the agent introspection API to get the Docker ID for a container in your task. You can use the agent introspection API by connecting to a container instance using SSH. For more information, see Connect to your container instance.
Important
Your container instance must have an IAM role that allows access to Amazon ECS in order to reach the introspection API. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Instance IAM Role.
The below example shows two tasks, one that is currently running and one that was stopped.
Note
The command below is piped through the python -mjson.tool for greater readability.

In the above example, the stopped task (090eff9b-1ce3-4db6-848a-a8d14064fd24) has two containers. You can use docker inspect container-ID to view detailed information on each container. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Introspection.
