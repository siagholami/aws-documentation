Deregistering task definition revisions
If you decide that you no longer need a specific task definition revision in Amazon ECS, you can deregister the task definition revision so that it no longer displays in your ListTaskDefinition API calls or in the console when you want to run a task or update a service.
When you deregister a task definition revision, it is immediately marked as INACTIVE. Existing tasks and services that reference an INACTIVE task definition revision continue to run without disruption, and existing services that reference an INACTIVE task definition revision can still scale up or down by modifying the service's desired count.
You cannot use an INACTIVE task definition revision to run new tasks or create new services, and you cannot update an existing service to reference an INACTIVE task definition revision (although there may be up to a 10-minute window following deregistration where these restrictions have not yet taken effect).
Note
At this time, INACTIVE task definition revisions remain discoverable in your account indefinitely; however, this behavior is subject to change in the future, so you should not rely on INACTIVE task definition revisions persisting beyond the lifecycle of any associated tasks and services.
Use the following procedure to deregister a task definition revision.
