Considerations for specifying sensitive data using Systems Manager Parameter Store
The following should be considered when specifying sensitive data for containers using Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters.
 For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, this feature requires that your task use platform version 1.3.0 or later. For information, see AWS Fargate platform versions.
 For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, this feature requires that your container instance have version 1.22.0 or later of the container agent. However, we recommend using the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version, see Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent.
 Sensitive data is injected into your container when the container is initially started. If the secret or Parameter Store parameter is subsequently updated or rotated, the container will not receive the updated value automatically. You must either launch a new task or if your task is part of a service you can update the service and use the Force new deployment option to force the service to launch a fresh task.
 For Windows tasks that are configured to use the awslogs logging driver, you must also set the ECS_ENABLE_AWSLOGS_EXECUTIONROLE_OVERRIDE environment variable on your container instance. This can be done with User Data using the following syntax:
```
  
Initialize-ECSAgent -Cluster  -EnableTaskIAMRole -LoggingDrivers '["json-file","awslogs"]'
  
  ```
Required IAM permissions for Amazon ECS secrets
To use this feature, you must have the Amazon ECS task execution role and reference it in your task definition. This allows the container agent to pull the necessary AWS Systems Manager resources. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role.
Important
For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, you must use the ECS agent configuration variable ECS_ENABLE_AWSLOGS_EXECUTIONROLE_OVERRIDE=true to use this feature. You can add it to the ./etc/ecs/ecs.config file during container instance creation or you can add it to an existing instance and then restart the ECS agent. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration.
To provide access to the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters that you create, manually add the following permissions as an inline policy to the task execution role. For more information, see Adding and Removing IAM Policies.
 ssm:GetParameters—Required if you are referencing a Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter in a task definition.
 secretsmanager:GetSecretValue—Required if you are referencing a Secrets Manager secret either directly or if your Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter is referencing a Secrets Manager secret in a task definition.
 kms:Decrypt—Required only if your secret uses a custom KMS key and not the default key. The ARN for your custom key should be added as a resource.
The following example inline policy adds the required permissions:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:GetParameters",
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "kms:Decrypt"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ssm:<region>:<aws_account_id>:parameter/<parameter_name>",
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<aws_account_id>:secret:<secret_name>",
        "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<aws_account_id>:key/<key_id>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Injecting sensitive data as an environment variable
Within your container definition, specify secrets with the name of the environment variable to set in the container and the full ARN of the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter containing the sensitive data to present to the container.
The following is a snippet of a task definition showing the format when referencing an Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter. If the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the task you are launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.
{
  "containerDefinitions": [{
    "secrets": [{
      "name": "environment_variable_name",
      "valueFrom": "arn:aws:ssm:region:aws_account_id:parameter/parameter_name"
    }]
  }]
}
Injecting sensitive data in a log configuration
Within your container definition, when specifying a logConfiguration you can specify secretOptions with the name of the log driver option to set in the container and the full ARN of the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter containing the sensitive data to present to the container.
Important
If the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the task you are launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.
The following is a snippet of a task definition showing the format when referencing an Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter.
{
  "containerDefinitions": [{
    "logConfiguration": [{
      "logDriver": "fluentd",
      "options": {
        "tag": "fluentd demo"
      },
      "secretOptions": [{
        "name": "fluentd-address",
        "valueFrom": "arn:aws:ssm:region:aws_account_id:parameter:parameter_name"
      }]
    }]
  }]
}
Creating an AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter
You can use the AWS Systems Manager console to create a Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter for your sensitive data. For more information, see Walkthrough: Create and Use a Parameter in a Command (Console) in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
To create a Parameter Store parameter


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Parameter Store, Create parameter.


For Name, type a hierarchy and a parameter name. For example, type test/database_password.


For Description, type an optional description.


For Type, choose String, StringList, or SecureString.
Note
If you choose SecureString, the KMS Key ID field appears. If you don't provide a KMS CMK ID, a KMS CMK ARN, an alias name, or an alias ARN, then the system uses alias/aws/ssm, which is the default KMS CMK for Systems Manager. To avoid using this key, choose a custom key. For more information, see Use Secure String Parameters in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
When you create a secure string parameter in the console by using the key-id parameter with either a custom KMS CMK alias name or an alias ARN, you must specify the prefix alias/ before the alias. The following is an ARN example:  
arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName
The following is an alias name example:  
alias/MyAliasName


For Value, type a value. For example, MyFirstParameter. If you chose SecureString, the value is masked as you type.


Choose Create parameter.


Creating a Task Definition that References sensitive data
You can use the Amazon ECS console to create a task definition that references a Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter.
To create a task definition that specifies a secret


Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.


In the navigation pane, choose task definitions, Create new task definition.


On the Select launch type compatibility page, choose the launch type for your tasks and choose Next step.
Note
This step only applies to Regions that currently support Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate. For more information, see Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate.


For task definition Name, type a name for your task definition. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.


For Task execution role, either select your existing task execution role or choose Create new role to have one created for you. This role authorizes Amazon ECS to pull private images for your task. For more information, see Required IAM permissions for private registry authentication.
Important
If the Task execution role field does not appear, choose Configure via JSON and manually add the executionRoleArn field to specify your task execution role. The following code shows the syntax:  


"executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws_account_id:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole"


For each container to create in your task definition, complete the following steps:


Under Container Definitions, choose Add container.


For Container name, type a name for your container. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.


For Image, type the image name or path to your private image. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.


Expand Advanced container configuration.


For sensitive data to inject as environment variables, under Environment, for Environment variables, complete the following fields:


For Key, enter the name of the environment variable to set in the container. This corresponds to the name field in the secrets section of a container definition.


For Value, choose ValueFrom. For Add value, enter the full ARN of the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter that contains the data to present to your container as an environment variable.
Note
If the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the task you are launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the secret. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.




For secrets referenced in the log configuration for a container, under Storage and Logging, for Log configuration, complete the following fields:


Clear the Auto-configure CloudWatch Logs option.


Under Log options, for Key, enter the name of the log configuration option to set.


For Value, choose ValueFrom. For Add value, enter the name or full ARN of the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter that contains the data to present to your log configuration as a log option.
Note
If the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the task you are launching, then you can use either the full ARN or the name of the secret. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.




Fill out the remaining required fields and any optional fields to use in your container definitions. More container definition parameters are available in the Advanced container configuration menu. For more information, see Task definition parameters.


Choose Add.


When your containers are added, choose Create.
