Using Docker Compose File Syntax
The ecs-cli compose and ecs-cli compose service commands allow you to create task definitions and manage your Amazon ECS tasks and services using Docker Compose files. For more information, see ecs-cli compose and ecs-cli compose service.
At this time, the latest version of the Amazon ECS CLI only supports the major versions of Docker Compose file syntax versions 1, 2, and 3. The version specified in the compose file must be the string "1", "1.0", "2", "2.0", "3", or "3.0". Docker Compose minor versions are not supported.
By default, the Amazon ECS CLI commands look for a Docker Compose file in the current directory, named docker-compose.yml. However, you can also specify a different file name or path to a Compose file with the --file option. This is especially useful for managing tasks and services from multiple Compose files at a time with the Amazon ECS CLI.
The following parameters are supported in Compose files for the Amazon ECS CLI:
 cap_add (not valid for tasks using the Fargate launch type)
 cap_drop (not valid for tasks using the Fargate launch type)
 command
 cpu_shares
Note
If you're using the Compose version 3.0 format, cpu_shares should be specified in the ecs-params.yml file. For more information, see Using Amazon ECS Parameters.
 devices (not valid for tasks using the Fargate launch type)
 dns
 dns_search
 entrypoint
 environment: If an environment variable value isn't specified in the Compose file, but it exists in the shell environment, the shell environment variable value is passed to the task definition that is created for any associated tasks or services.
Important
We don't recommend using plaintext environment variables for sensitive information, such as credential data.
 env_file
Important
We don't recommend using plaintext environment variables for sensitive information, such as credential data.
