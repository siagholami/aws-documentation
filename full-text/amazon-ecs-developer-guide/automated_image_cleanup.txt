Automated Task and Image Cleanup
Each time a task is placed on a container instance, the Amazon ECS container agent checks to see if the images referenced in the task are the most recent of the specified tag in the repository. If not, the default behavior allows the agent to pull the images from their respective repositories. If you frequently update the images in your tasks and services, your container instance storage can quickly fill up with Docker images that you are no longer using and may never use again. For example, you may use a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
Note
The Amazon ECS agent image pull behavior can be customized using the ECS_IMAGE_PULL_BEHAVIOR parameter. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration.
Likewise, containers that belong to stopped tasks can also consume container instance storage with log information, data volumes, and other artifacts. These artifacts are useful for debugging containers that have stopped unexpectedly, but most of this storage can be safely freed up after a period of time. 
By default, the Amazon ECS container agent automatically cleans up stopped tasks and Docker images that are not being used by any tasks on your container instances.
Note
The automated image cleanup feature requires at least version 1.13.0 of the Amazon ECS container agent. To update your agent to the latest version, see Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent.
Tunable Parameters
The following agent configuration variables are available to tune your automated task and image cleanup experience. For more information about how to set these variables on your container instances, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration.
ECS_ENGINE_TASK_CLEANUP_WAIT_DURATION
This variable specifies the time to wait before removing any containers that belong to stopped tasks. The image cleanup process cannot delete an image as long as there is a container that references it. After images are not referenced by any containers (either stopped or running), then the image becomes a candidate for cleanup. By default, this parameter is set to 3 hours but you can reduce this period to as low as 1 minute, if you need to for your application.
ECS_DISABLE_IMAGE_CLEANUP
If you set this variable to true, then automated image cleanup is disabled on your container instance and no images are automatically removed.
ECS_IMAGE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL
This variable specifies how frequently the automated image cleanup process should check for images to delete. The default is every 30 minutes but you can reduce this period to as low as 10 minutes to remove images more frequently.
ECS_IMAGE_MINIMUM_CLEANUP_AGE
This variable specifies the minimum amount of time between when an image was pulled and when it may become a candidate for removal. This is used to prevent cleaning up images that have just been pulled. The default is 1 hour.
ECS_NUM_IMAGES_DELETE_PER_CYCLE
This variable specifies how many images may be removed during a single cleanup cycle. The default is 5 and the minimum is 1.
Cleanup Workflow
When the Amazon ECS container agent is running and automated image cleanup is not disabled, the agent checks for Docker images that are not referenced by running or stopped containers at a frequency determined by the ECS_IMAGE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL variable. If unused images are found and they are older than the minimum cleanup time specified by the ECS_IMAGE_MINIMUM_CLEANUP_AGE variable, the agent removes up to the maximum number of images that are specified with the ECS_NUM_IMAGES_DELETE_PER_CYCLE variable. The least-recently referenced images are deleted first. After the images are removed, the agent waits until the next interval and repeats the process again.
