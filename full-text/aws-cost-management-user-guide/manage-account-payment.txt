Examples for alternate contacts
We would reach out to each contact type in the following scenarios:
 Billing - When your monthly invoice is available, or your payment method needs to be updated. If your Receive PDF Invoice By Email is turned on in your Billing preferences, your alternate billing contact will receive the PDF invoices as well.
 Operations - When your service is, or will be, temporarily unavailable in one of more Regions. Any notification related to operations.
 Security - When you have notifications from the AWS Abuse team for potentially fraudulent activity on your AWS account. Any notification related to security.
Enabling and disabling regions
AWS originally enabled all new Regions by default, which enabled your users to create resources in any Region. Now when AWS adds a Region, the new Region is disabled by default. If you want your users to be able to create resources in a new Region, you enable the Region.
Note the following about enabling and disabling Regions:
You can use IAM permissions to control access to Regions
IAM added three new permissions, which let you control which users can enable, disable, and list Regions. For more information, see Billing actions.
Enabling a Region is free
There is no charge to enable a Region. You're only charged for resources that you create in the new Region.
Disabling a Region disables access to resources in the Region
If you disable a Region that still includes AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, you can't access the resources in that Region. For example, you can't use the AWS Management Console or any programmatic method to view or change the configuration of any EC2 instances in that Region.
Charges continue if you disable a Region
If you disable a Region that still includes AWS resources, charges for those resources (if any) continue to accrue at the standard rate. For example, if you disable a Region that contains Amazon EC2 instances, you still have to pay the charges for those instances even though the instances are inaccessible.
Disabling a Region isn't always immediately visible
If you disable a Region, the change takes time to become visible in all possible endpoints. Disabling a Region can take between a few seconds to minutes to take effect. 
Existing Regions are enabled by default
The original Regions (the Regions that existed before we added the ability to enable and disable Regions) are all enabled by default and can't be disabled.
Enabling a Region takes a few minutes for most accounts
Enabling a Region generally takes effect in a few minutes, although it can take longer for some accounts. If enabling a Region takes longer than nine hours, sign in to the AWS Support Center and open a case with AWS Support.

Enabling tax setting inheritance
You can use your tax registration information with your linked accounts by enabling your Tax Settings Inheritance. After you enable it, your tax registration information is added to your other AWS Organizations accounts, saving you the effort of registering redundant information. Tax invoices are processed with the consistent tax information, and your usage from linked accounts will consolidate to a single tax invoice.
Tax registration information includes:
 Business legal name
 Tax address
 Tax registration number
 Special exemptions (does not apply for US sales tax exemptions)
