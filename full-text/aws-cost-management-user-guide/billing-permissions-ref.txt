Using identity-based policies (IAM policies) for Billing and Cost Management
This topic provides examples of identity-based policies that demonstrate how an account administrator can attach permissions policies to IAM identities (users, groups, and roles) and thereby grant permissions to perform operations on Billing and Cost Management resources.
For a full discussion of AWS accounts and IAM users, see What Is IAM? in the IAM User Guide.
