Deactivating the AWS-Generated Cost Allocation Tags
Master account owners can deactivate the AWS generated tags in the Billing and Cost Management console. When a master account owner deactivates the tag, it's also deactivated for all member accounts. After you deactivate the AWS generated tags, AWS no longer applies the tag to new resources. Previously tagged resources remain tagged.
To deactivate the AWS generated tags


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/.


In the navigation pane, choose Cost Allocation Tags.


Under AWS-Generated Cost Allocation Tags, choose Deactivate.


It can take up to 24 hours for tags to deactivate.
