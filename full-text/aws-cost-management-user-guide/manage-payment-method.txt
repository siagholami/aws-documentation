To view payment methods associated with your AWS account


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/.


In the navigation pane, choose Payment methods. 


Designate a default payment method
You can use the console to designate a default payment method for your AWS account.
To designate a default payment method


Open the Billing and Cost Management console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/.


In the navigation pane, choose Payment methods. 


Next to the payment method that you want to use as your default payment method, choose Make Default.


Make a payment
AWS charges your default payment method automatically at the beginning of each month. If that charge doesn't process successfully, you can use the console to update your payment method and make a payment.
Note
If you pay by ACH direct debit, AWS provides you with your invoice and initiates the charge to your payment method within 10 days of the start of the month. It can take 3â€“5 days for your payment to succeed. For more information, see Managing your ACH direct debit payment methods.
To make a payment


Open the Billing and Cost Management console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/.


In the navigation pane, choose Payment methods.


On the Payment Methods page, ensure that the payment method that you want to use is set as your default payment method.


If you are using a credit card, confirm that your card hasn't expired.


Choose Make a Payment. You're redirected to the Orders and invoices page.


If your account isn't past due, the Orders and invoices page shows only your previous invoices in the Order and invoice history section. You don't need to take any action at this time.


If you see a banner that states that you have an overdue payment, choose Verify and pay for the invoice that is overdue in the Payments Due section.


If you pay by ACH direct debit and you receive an email from AWS saying that AWS is unable to charge your bank account and will attempt to charge your account again, work with your bank to understand what went wrong. If you receive an email saying that AWS failed the last attempt to charge your bank account, use the Verify and pay button on the console to pay your invoice. If you have questions about issues with charging your bank account or paying an overdue balance, create a case in the Support Center.
If you pay by electronic funds transfer and your account payment is overdue, create a case in the Support Center.
