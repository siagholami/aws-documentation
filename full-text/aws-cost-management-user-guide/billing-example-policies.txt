Billing and Cost Management policy examples
This topic contains example policies that you can attach to your IAM user or group to control access to your account's billing information and tools. The following basic rules apply to IAM policies for Billing and Cost Management:
 Version is always 2012-10-17.
 Effect is always Allow or Deny.
 Action is the name of the action or a wildcard (*). 
The action prefix is budgets for AWS Budgets, cur for AWS Cost and Usage reports, aws-portal for AWS Billing, or ce for Cost Explorer.
 Resource is always * for AWS Billing.
For actions performed on a budget resource, specify the budget Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
 It's possible to have multiple statements in one policy.
Note
These policies require that you activate IAM user access to the Billing and Cost Management console on the Account Settings console page. For more information, see Activating access to the Billing and Cost Management console.

Example 1: Allow IAM users to view your billing information
To allow an IAM user to view your billing information without giving the IAM user access to sensitive account information, such as your password and account activity reports, use a policy similar to the following example policy. This policy allows IAM users to view the following Billing and Cost Management console pages, without giving them access to the Account Settings or Reports console pages:
 Dashboard
 Cost Explorer
 Bills
 Orders and invoices
 Consolidated Billing
 Preferences
 Credits
 Advance Payment
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "aws-portal:ViewBilling",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Example 2: Allow IAM users to access the reports console page
To allow an IAM user to access the Reports console page and to view the usage reports that contain account activity information, use a policy similar to this example policy.
For definitions of each action, see Billing actions.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "aws-portal:ViewUsage",
                "aws-portal:ViewBilling",
                "cur:DescribeReportDefinitions",
                "cur:PutReportDefinition",
                "cur:DeleteReportDefinition",
                "cur:ModifyReportDefinition"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Example 3: Deny IAM users access to the Billing and Cost Management console
To explicitly deny an IAM user access to the all Billing and Cost Management console pages, use a policy similar to this example policy.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "aws-portal:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Example 4: Allow full access to AWS services but deny IAM users access to the Billing and Cost Management console
To deny IAM users access to everything on the Billing and Cost Management console, use the following policy. In this case, you should also deny user access to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) so that the users can't access the policies that control access to billing information and tools.
Important
This policy doesn't allow any actions. Use this policy in combination with other policies that allow specific actions.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "aws-portal:*",
                "iam:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Example 5: Allow IAM users to view the Billing and Cost Management console except for account settings
This policy allows read-only access to all of the Billing and Cost Management console, including the Payments Method and Reports console pages, but denies access to the Account Settings page, thus protecting the account password, contact information, and security questions. 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "aws-portal:View*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "aws-portal:*Account",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Example 6: Allow IAM users to modify billing information
To allow IAM users to modify account billing information in the Billing and Cost Management console, you must also allow IAM users to view your billing information. The following policy example allows an IAM user to modify the Consolidated Billing, Preferences, and Credits console pages. It also allows an IAM user to view the following Billing and Cost Management console pages:
 Dashboard
 Cost Explorer
 Bills
 Orders and invoices
 Advance Payment
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "aws-portal:*Billing",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Example 7: Allow IAM users to create budgets
To allow IAM users to create budgets in the Billing and Cost Management console, you must also allow IAM users to view your billing information, create CloudWatch alarms, and create Amazon SNS notifications. The following policy example allows an IAM user to modify the Budget console page.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1435216493000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "aws-portal:ViewBilling",
                "aws-portal:ModifyBilling",
                "budgets:ViewBudget",
                "budgets:ModifyBudget"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1435216514000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1435216552000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sns:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
Example 8: Deny access to account settings, but allow full access to all other billing and usage information
To protect your account password, contact information, and security questions, you can deny IAM user access to Account Settings while still enabling full access to the rest of the functionality in the Billing and Cost Management console, as shown in the following example.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "aws-portal:*Billing",
                "aws-portal:*Usage",
                "aws-portal:*PaymentMethods"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "aws-portal:*Account",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Example 9: Deposit reports into an Amazon S3 bucket
The following policy allows Billing and Cost Management to save your detailed AWS bills to an Amazon S3 bucket, as long as you own both the AWS account and the Amazon S3 bucket. Note that this policy must be applied to the Amazon S3 bucket, instead of to an IAM user. That is, it's a resource-based policy, not a user-based policy. You should deny IAM user access to the bucket for IAM users who don't need access to your bills.
Replace bucketname with the name of your bucket.
For more information, see  Using Bucket Policies and User Policies.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Service": "billingreports.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": [
      "s3:GetBucketAcl",
      "s3:GetBucketPolicy"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucketname"
  },
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Service": "billingreports.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": "s3:PutObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucketname/*"
  }
  ]
}
Example 10: Find products and prices
To allow an IAM user to use the AWS Price List Service API, use the following policy to grant them access.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "pricing:DescribeServices",
                "pricing:GetAttributeValues",
                "pricing:GetProducts"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]

    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
