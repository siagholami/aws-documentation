Billing and account activity
Each month, AWS charges the payer account owner, and not the owners of the linked accounts. To see the total usage and charges across all the accounts in an organization, see the Bills page of the payer account. AWS updates the page multiple times each day. Additionally, AWS makes a downloadable cost report available each day.
Although the owners of the linked accounts aren't charged, they can still see their usage and charges by going to their AWS Bills pages. They can't view or obtain data for the payer account or any other linked accounts on the bill.
