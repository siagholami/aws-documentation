Creating Cost Categories
You can create Cost Categories to organize your cost and usage information. Regular accounts and Payer accounts in AWS Organizations have default access to create Cost Categories. Rules are not mutually exclusive, and you can control the order in which the rules apply. Allow up to 24 hours after creating a Cost Category for your usage records to be updated with values.
Use the following procedure to create a new Cost Category.
To create a Cost Category


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/.


In the navigation pane, choose Cost Categories.


At the top of the page, choose Create Cost Category.


Under Cost category details, enter the name of your Cost Category. Your Cost Category name must be unique within your account.


Choose Next.


Choose Define category values.


Use either the Rule Builder or JSON editor to define your Cost Categories. 
For more information about the JSON request syntax, see the AWS Billing and Cost Management API Reference.


For Value, enter the name of the Cost Category value.


Choose a billing Dimension from the dropdown list. You can choose Accounts, Service, Charge Type (for example, recurring reservation fee), or Tag key (Cost Allocation tag key).


Choose Operator from the dropdown list. Your options are Is, Contains, Starts with, and Ends with.
Note
Contains, Starts with, and Ends with are only supported with Accounts and Tag dimensions. If you use these operators with Accounts, the engine will evaluate against account name, and not account ID.


Choose a filtered value for your Dimension in the attribute selector.


(Optional) To rearrange the rule order, use the arrows or change the number on the top right of each rule.


(Optional) To delete a rule, select Remove on the top right of each rule.
