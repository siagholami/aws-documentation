Managing your ACH direct debit payment methods
If you meet the eligibility requirements, you can add a US bank account as an ACH direct debit payment method to your payment methods. 
To be eligible, your account must meet the following requirements:
 It is an Amazon Web Services, Inc. customer. 
 It is at least 60 days old.
 It has paid at least one invoice in full in the previous 12 months.
 It has paid at least $100 cumulative over the previous 12 months.
 It uses USD as the preferred currency.
If you pay by ACH direct debit, AWS provides you with your invoice and initiates the charge to your payment method within 10 days of the start of the month. It can take up to 20 days for the payment to complete successfully, even if the payment shows as Succeeded on the Billing and Cost Management console.
You can use the Payment Methods page of the Billing and Cost Management console to perform the following ACH direct debit tasks:
 Add a direct debit account to your AWS payment methods
 Update your linked debit account
