Identity and Access Management for Application Auto Scaling
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) service that helps an administrator securely control access to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to use AWS resources. IAM is an AWS service that you can use with no additional charge. 
To use Application Auto Scaling, you need an AWS account and AWS credentials. To increase the security of your AWS account, we recommend that you use an IAM user to make authenticated requests instead of using your AWS account root user credentials. You can create an IAM user and grant that user full access. We refer to these users as administrator users. You can use the administrator user credentials, instead of AWS account root user credentials, to interact with AWS and perform tasks, such as configuring scaling policies. For more information, see AWS Account Root User Credentials vs. IAM User Credentials in the AWS General Reference and IAM Best Practices in the IAM User Guide. 
After you create an IAM user, you will need to obtain your AWS access keys if you want to access Application Auto Scaling through the Application Auto Scaling API, whether by the Query (HTTPS) interface directly or indirectly through an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface, or the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell. AWS access keys consist of an access key ID and a secret access key. For more information about getting your AWS access keys, see AWS Security Credentials in the AWS General Reference.
To get started quickly using Application Auto Scaling to set up automatic scaling, go through the steps in Setting Up. As you go through the example tutorial, you create an IAM user and AWS access keys for the specified user.
