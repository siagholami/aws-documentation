StartTextTranslationJob
Starts an asynchronous batch translation job. Batch translation jobs can be used to translate large volumes of text across multiple documents at once. For more information, see Asynchronous Batch Processing.
Batch translation jobs can be described with the DescribeTextTranslationJob operation, listed with the ListTextTranslationJobs operation, and stopped with the StopTextTranslationJob operation.
Note
Amazon Translate does not support batch translation of multiple source languages at once.
