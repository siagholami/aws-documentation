Real-Time Translation
To translate a single text document and return the results of that translation directly to your application, use the Amazon Translate real-time translation operation, TranslateText. Use this translation mode for interactive applications that work on one document at a time.
For an example of a real-time translation workflow, see Translate Text Using the Command Line.
