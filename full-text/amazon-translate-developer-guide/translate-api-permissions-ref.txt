Amazon Translate API Permissions: Actions, Resources, and Conditions Reference
Use the following table as a reference when writing a permissions policy that you can attach to an IAM identity (an identity-based policy). The list includes each Amazon Translate API operation, the corresponding action for which you can grant permissions, and the AWS resource for which you can grant the permissions. You specify the actions in the policy's Action field, and you specify the resource value in the policy's Resource field. 
To express conditions, you can use AWS-wide condition keys in your Amazon Translate policies. For a complete list of AWS-wide keys, see Available Keys in the IAM User Guide. 
Note
To specify an action, use the translate: prefix followed by the API operation name, for example, translate:TranslateText.
If you see an expand arrow (↗) in the upper-right corner of the table, you can open the table in a new window. To close the window, choose the close button (X) in the lower-right corner.

| [ StopTextTranslationJob APIrequestsStopTextTranslationJob  Stops an asynchronous batch translation job that is in progress. If the job's state is IN_PROGRESS, the job will be marked for termination and put into the STOP_REQUESTED state. If the job completes before it can be stopped, it is put into the COMPLETED state. Otherwise, the job is put into the STOPPED state. Asynchronous batch translation jobs are started with the StartTextTranslationJob operation. You can use the DescribeTextTranslationJob or ListTextTranslationJobs operations to get a batch translation job's JobId.  Request Syntax
