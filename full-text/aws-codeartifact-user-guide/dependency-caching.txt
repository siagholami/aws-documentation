Dependency caching
You can enable local caching in CodeBuild to reduce the number of dependencies that need to be fetched from CodeArtifact for each build. For information, see Build Caching in AWS CodeBuild in the AWS CodeBuild User Guide. After you enable a custom local cache, add the cache directory to your project's buildspec.yaml file.
For example, if you are using mvn, use the following.
cache:
  paths:
    - '/root/.m2/**/*'
For other tools, use the cache folders shown in this table.
