You can view details about and update your repository using the CodeArtifact console. 


Open the AWS CodeArtifact console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codeartifact/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Repositories, and then choose the repository that you want to view or modify. 


Expand Details to see the following: 
     The repository's domain. Choose the domain name to learn more about it. 
     The repository's resource policy. Choose Apply a repository policy to add one. 
     The repository's Amazon Resource Name (ARN). 
     If your repository has an external connection, you can choose the connection to learn more about it. A repository can have only one external connection. For more information, see Add an external connection. 
     If your repository has upstream repositories, you can choose one to see its details. A repository can have up to 10 upstream repositories. For more information, see Working with upstream repositories in CodeArtifact. 
Note
 A repository can have an external connection or upstream repositories, but not both. 


In Packages, you can see any packages that are available to this repository. Choose a package to learn more about it. 


Choose Configure package manager, and then choose a package manager to learn how to configure it with CodeArtifact. 


Choose Edit, and then choose Repository to update the following. 
     The repository description. 
     If your repository has an external connection, you can change which public repository it connects to. Otherwise, you can add one or more existing repositories as upstream repositories. Arrange them in the order you want them prioritized by CodeArtifact when a package is requested. For more information, see Upstream repository priority order. 


Choose Edit, and then choose Repository policy to update or add a resource policy to your repository. For more information, see  Repository policies. 


View or modify a repository configuration (AWS CLI)
To view a repository's current configuration in CodeArtifact, use the describe-repository command.
aws codeartifact describe-repository --domain my-domain --domain-owner domain-owner-id --repository my-repo
Example output:
{
         "repository": {
             "name": "my-repo",
             "administratorAccount": "123456789012,
             "domainName": "my-domain",
             "domainOwner": "123456789012",
             "arn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:region-id:544120495673:repository/my-domain/my-repo"
             "upstreams": [],
             "externalConnections": []
         }
     }
Modify a repository upstream configuration
An upstream repository allows a package manager client to access the packages contained in more than one repository using a single URL endpoint. To add or change a repository's upstream relationship, use the update-repository command.
aws codeartifact update-repository --domain my-domain --domain-owner domain-owner-id --repository my-repo \
       --upstreams repositoryName=my-upstream-repo
Example output:
{
         "repository": {
             "name": "my-repo",
             "administratorAccount": "123456789012,
             "domainName": "my-domain",
             "domainOwner": "123456789012",
             "arn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:region-id:544120495673:repository/my-domain/my-repo"
             "upstreams": [
                 {
                     "repositoryName": "my-upstream-repo"
                 }
             ],
             "externalConnections": []    }
     }
Note
To add an upstream repository, you must have permission for the AssociateWithDownstreamRepository action on the upstream repository.
To remove a repository's upstream relationship, use an empty list as the argument to the --upstreams option, as follows.
aws codeartifact update-repository --domain my-domain --domain-owner domain-owner-id --repository my-repo --upstreams []
Example output:
{
         "repository": {
             "name": "my-repo",
             "administratorAccount": "123456789012,
             "domainName": "my-domain",
             "domainOwner": "123456789012",
             "arn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:region-id:544120495673:repository/my-domain/my-repo"
             "upstreams": [],
             "externalConnections": []
         }
     }
