Supported commands that interact with a repository
This section lists pip commands where the pip client makes one or more requests to the registry it's been configured with. These commands have been verified to function correctly when invoked against an CodeArtifact repository.




Command
Description




install
Install packages.


download
Download packages.



CodeArtifact does not implement pip search. If you have configured pip with a CodeArtifact repository, running pip search will search and show packages from PyPI.
Supported client-side commands
These commands don't require any direct interaction with a repository, so CodeArtifact does not need to do anything to support them.
