Creating projects
As a portal administrator, you select a set of assets and then create a project for those assets (see Adding assets to a new project). You can also create an empty project and add assets later.
Creating a new project
Follow this procedure to create a new project.
To create a new project


In the navigation bar, choose the Projects icon.



On the Projects page, choose Create project



In the Create new project dialog box, enter a Project name and Project description. Use a description that informs users about the assets and visualizations in the project.



Choose Finish to create the new project.


Next, you might assign project owners and add assets to the project. Until you add assets to the project, the project owner can't create dashboards and visualizations.
