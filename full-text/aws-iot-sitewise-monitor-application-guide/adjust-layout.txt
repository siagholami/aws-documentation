Adjusting dashboard layout
As the project owner, you can choose the best visualizations for your asset properties, and you can adjust the size and location of your visualizations in the dashboard.
To adjust your layout


To move a visualization, use the control icon in the upper left. Drag the visualization to a new location.



To change the size of a visualization, use the resize control in the lower right. Drag the corner to a new size and shape. Visualizations snap to the grid when resized, so you only have coarse control over the size.


After you finish editing the dashboard, choose Save dashboard to save your changes. The dashboard editor closes. If you try to close a dashboard that has unsaved changes, you're prompted to save them.
