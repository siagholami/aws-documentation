Creating dashboards
As a project owner, you create dashboards in AWS IoT SiteWise Monitor to provide a shared view of asset properties to your project viewers. You can create a dashboard from the Dashboards page or while viewing a project's details.
To create a dashboard from the dashboards page


In the navigation bar, choose the Dashboards icon.



On the Dashboards page, choose Create dashboard.



In the dashboard editor, change the dashboard name from the default, New dashboard*, to something that describes the content*.



Add one or more visualizations. For more information, see Adding visualizations.


After you finish editing the dashboard, choose Save dashboard to save your changes. The dashboard editor closes. If you try to close a dashboard that has unsaved changes, you're prompted to save them.
