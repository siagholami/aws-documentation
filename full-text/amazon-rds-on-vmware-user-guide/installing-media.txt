Installing the Media for Microsoft SQL Server
If you are using Microsoft SQL Server, an on-premises customer provided license is required. In this case, make sure that you install your operating system media and database media before you create Amazon RDS DB instances.
Important
MySQL and PostgreSQL don't require you to install media. If you plan to use one of these DB engines, you can move on to Choosing the On-Premises DB Instance Class.
Supported Media
Currently, the following media are supported:

Install the Media
You can install the media using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.
Console
To install media in a custom AZ


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.


In the top-right corner of the console, choose the AWS Region that contains the custom AZ in which you want to create the DB instance. 


In the navigation pane, choose Custom AZs.


The Custom AZs page appears.


Choose the name of the custom AZ on which you want to install media to show the custom AZ details.

The details page for the custom AZ appears.


In the Install media section, choose Import.

The Import media page appears.



In the Engine options section, choose the DB engine, the edition, and the version.


In the Importation settings section, complete the settings:
    OS installation path – The absolute path to the operating system media on your VMware cluster datastore
    Engine installation path – The absolute path to the DB engine media on your VMware cluster datastore
Important
The edition and version of the media referenced in the Engine installation path must match the DB engine edition and version that you chose in the previous step.
For information about supported media, see Supported Media.


Both paths must be present on the same datastore that was specified in the Installer during onboarding. Don't include the datastore name in the path. The following are examples of valid paths:
    OS installation path – WindowsISO/en_windows_server_2016_x64_dvd_9327751.iso
    Engine installation path – SQLServerISO/en_sql_server_2016_enterprise_x64_dvd_8701793.iso

Choose Import media.

You can monitor the status of the import on the details page for the custom AZ.

AWS CLI
To install media by using the AWS CLI, call the import-installation-media command with the options following. All of the options are required. 
 --custom-availability-zone-id – The identifier of the custom Availability Zone (AZ) to import the installation media to
 --engine – The name of the database engine to be used for this instance
 --engine-installation-media-path – The absolute path to the DB engine media on your VMware cluster datastore
Important
The edition and version of the media specified in the --engine-installation-media-path must match the DB engine edition and version specified in the --engine option.
The path must be present on the same datastore that was specified in the installer during onboarding. Don't include the datastore name in the path.
 --engine-version – The version number of the database engine to use
 --os-installation-media-path – The absolute path to the operating system media on your VMware cluster datastore
Important
The path must be present on the same datastore that was specified in the installer during onboarding. Do not include the datastore name in the path.
For information about supported media, see Supported Media.
Example
The following example imports the installation media for a sqlserver-ee engine.
For Linux, OS X, or Unix:  
1.      
2. aws rds import-installation-media \
3.     --custom-availability-zone-id mycustomaz_identifier \
4.     --engine sqlserver-ee \
5.     --engine-version 13.00.5292.0.v1 \
6.     --engine-installation-media-path SQLServerISO/en_sql_server_2016_enterprise_x64_dvd_8701793.iso \
7.     --os-installation-media-path WindowsISO/en_windows_server_2016_x64_dvd_9327751.iso
For Windows:  
1. aws rds import-installation-media ^
2.     --custom-availability-zone-id mycustomaz_identifier ^
3.     --engine sqlserver-ee ^
4.     --engine-version 13.00.5292.0.v1 ^
5.     --engine-installation-media-path SQLServerISO/en_sql_server_2016_enterprise_x64_dvd_8701793.iso ^
6.     --os-installation-media-path WindowsISO/en_windows_server_2016_x64_dvd_9327751.iso
Replace the placeholders with appropriate values.
RDS API
To install media by using the Amazon RDS API, call the ImportInstallationMedia operation with the parameters following. All of the parameters are required. 
 CustomAvailabilityZoneId – The identifier of the custom Availability Zone (AZ) to import the installation media to
 Engine – The name of the database engine to be used for this instance
 EngineInstallationMediaPath – The path to the installation media for the specified DB engine
 EngineVersion – The version number of the database engine to use
 OSInstallationMediaPath – The path to the installation media for the operating system associated with the specified DB engine
Troubleshooting Media Installation Issues for Microsoft SQL Server
Use the following sections to troubleshoot problems that you have with installing the media for Microsoft SQL Server.
Topics
 Media Not Found
 Media Not Supported
 Custom AZ Disconnected
Media Not Found
In this case, the media wasn't found in the specified location, and the following errors can be returned.
OS media not found at provided location                
Engine media not found at provided location
The cause for this issue is almost always one of the following:
 The specified path for the media is incorrect.
 The datastore is included in the path.
 The media path isn't in the datastore that was specified during onboarding.
To solve the issue, make sure that the path is correct and that the datastore isn't included in the path. Also, make sure that the media is in the datastore that was specified in the installer during onboarding.
For information about onboarding, see Getting Started with Amazon RDS on VMware.
Media Not Supported
In this case, the specified media isn't supported by Amazon RDS on VMware, and the following errors can be returned:
OS media validation failed               
Engine media validation failed
To solve the issue, specify supported installation media. For information about supported media, see Supported Media.
Custom AZ Disconnected
In this case, the custom AZ that you attempted to attach installation media to can't currently be reached.
To solve the issue, see Custom AZ Is Disconnected.
