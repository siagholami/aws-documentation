Deploy a REST API in API Gateway
In API Gateway, a REST API deployment is represented by a Deployment resource. It's similar to an executable of an API that is represented by a RestApi resource. 
For the client to call your API, you must create a deployment and associate a stage with it. A stage is represented by a Stage resource. It represents a snapshot of the API, including methods, integrations, models, mapping templates, and Lambda authorizers (formerly known as custom authorizers). When you update the API, you can redeploy the API by associating a new stage with the existing deployment. We discuss creating a stage in Setting up a stage for a REST API.

Create a deployment using the AWS CLI
When you create a deployment, you instantiate the Deployment resource. You can use the API Gateway console, the AWS CLI, an AWS SDK, or the API Gateway REST API to create a deployment. 
To use the CLI to create a deployment, use the create-deployment command:
aws apigateway create-deployment --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> --region <region>
The API is not callable until you associate this deployment with a stage. With an existing stage, you can do this by updating the stage's https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/#deploymentId property with the newly created deployment ID (<deployment-id>).
aws apigateway update-stage --region <region> \
    --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> \ 
    --stage-name <stage-name> \ 
    --patch-operations op='replace',path='/deploymentId',value='<deployment-id>'
When deploying an API the first time, you can combine the stage creation and deployment creation at the same time:
aws apigateway create-deployment --region <region> \
    --rest-api-id <rest-api-id> \
    --stage-name <stage-name>
This is what is done behind the scenes in the API Gateway console when you deploy an API the first time, or when you redeploy the API to a new stage.
