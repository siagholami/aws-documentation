Create a canary release deployment
You create a canary release deployment when deploying the API with canary settings as an additional input to the deployment creation operation. 
You can also create a canary release deployment from an existing non-canary deployment by making a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/link-relation/stage-update/ request to add the canary settings on the stage.
When creating a non-canary release deployment, you can specify a non-existing stage name. API Gateway creates one if the specified stage does not exist. However, you cannot specify any non-existing stage name when creating a canary release deployment. You will get an error and API Gateway will not create any canary release deployment. 
You can create a canary release deployment in API Gateway using the API Gateway console, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK.

To use the API Gateway console to create a canary release deployment, follow the instructions below:
To create the initial canary release deployment


Sign in to the API Gateway console.


Choose an existing API or create a new API.


Change the API, if necessary, or set up desired API methods and integrations.


Choose Deploy API from the Actions drop-down menu. Follow the on-screen instructions in Deploy API to deploy the API to a new stage. 


So far, you have deployed the API to a production release stage. Next, you configure canary settings on the stage and, if needed, also enable caching, set stage variables, or configure API execution or access logs.


To enable API caching, choose the Settings tab in Stage Editor and follow the on-screen instructions. For more information, see Enabling API caching to enhance responsiveness.


To set stage variables, choose the Stage Variables tab in Stage Editor and follow the on-screen instructions to add or modify stage variables. For more information, see Setting up stage variables for a REST API deployment.


To configure execution or access logging, choose the Logs tab in Stage Editor and follow the on-screen instructions. For more information, see Setting up CloudWatch logging for a REST API in API Gateway.


In Stage Editor, choose the Canary tab and then choose Create Canary.


Under the Stage's Request Distribution section, choose the pencil icon next to Percentage of requests to Canary and type a number (for example, 5.0) in the input text field. Choose the check mark icon to save the setting.


To associate an AWS WAF web ACL with the stage, choose a web ACL from the Web ACL dropdown list.
Note
If needed, choose Create Web ACL to open the AWS WAF console in a new browser tab, create the web ACL, and return to the API Gateway console to associate the web ACL with the stage.


If desired, choose Block API Request if WebACL cannot be evaluated (Fail- Close).


If needed, choose Add Stage Variables to add them under the Canary Stage Variables section to override existing stage variables or add new stage variables for the canary release. 


If desired, choose Enable use of stage cache to enable caching for the canary release and save your choice. The cache is not available for the canary release until API caching is enabled.


After the canary release is initialized on the deployment stage, you change the API and want to test the changes. You can redeploy the API to the same stage so that both the updated version and the base version are accessible through the same stage. The following steps describe how to do that. 
To deploy the latest API version to a canary


With each update of the API, choose Deploy API from the Actions drop-down menu next to the Resources list.


In Deploy API, choose the now canary-enabled stage from the Deployment stage drop-down list. 


Optionally, type a description in  Deployment description. 


Choose Deploy to push the latest API version to the canary release. 


If desired, reconfigure the stage settings, logs, or canary settings, as describe in To create the initial canary release deployment.


As a result, the canary release points to the latest version while the production release still points to the initial version of the API. The https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/#canarySettings now has a new deploymentId value, whereas the stage still has the initial https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/#deploymentId value. Behind the scenes, the console calls https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/link-relation/stage-update/.
Create a canary deployment using the AWS CLI
First create a baseline deployment with two stage variables, but without any canary:
aws apigateway create-deployment 
    --variables sv0=val0,sv1=val1
    --rest-api-id 4wk1k4onj3 
    --stage-name prod
The command returns a representation of the resulting https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/deployment/, similar to the following:
{
    "id": "du4ot1", 
    "createdDate": 1511379050
}
The resulting deployment id identifies a snapshot (or version) of the API. 
Now create a canary deployment on the prod stage: 
aws apigateway create-deployment  
    --canary-settings '{ \
        "percentTraffic":10.5, \
        "useStageCache":false, \
        "stageVariableOverrides":{ \
            "sv1":"val2",  \
            "sv2":"val3" \
        } \ 
    }' \
    --rest-api-id 4wk1k4onj3 \
    --stage-name prod
If the specified stage (prod) does not exist, the preceding command returns an error. Otherwise, it returns the newly created deployment resource representation similar to the following:
{
    "id": "a6rox0", 
    "createdDate": 1511379433
}
The resulting deployment id identifies the test version of the API for the canary release. As a result, the associated stage is canary-enabled. You can view this stage representation by calling the get-stage command, similar to the following:
aws apigateway get-stage --rest-api-id 4wk1k4onj3 --stage-name prod
The following shows a representation of the Stage as the output of the command:
{
    "stageName": "prod", 
    "variables": {
        "sv0": "val0", 
        "sv1": "val1"
    }, 
    "cacheClusterEnabled": false, 
    "cacheClusterStatus": "NOT_AVAILABLE", 
    "deploymentId": "du4ot1", 
    "lastUpdatedDate": 1511379433, 
    "createdDate": 1511379050, 
    "canarySettings": {
        "percentTraffic": 10.5, 
        "deploymentId": "a6rox0", 
        "useStageCache": false, 
        "stageVariableOverrides": {
            "sv2": "val3", 
            "sv1": "val2"
        }
    }, 
    "methodSettings": {}
}
In this example, the base version of the API will use the stage variables of {"sv0":val0", "sv1":val1"}, while the test version uses the stage variables of {"sv1":val2", "sv2":val3"}. Both the production release and canary release use the same stage variable of sv1, but with different values, val1 and val2, respectively. The stage variable of sv0 is used solely in the production release and the stage variable of sv2 is used in the canary release only. 
You can create a canary release deployment from an existing regular deployment by updating the stage to enable a canary. To demonstrate this, create a regular deployment first:
aws apigateway create-deployment \
    --variables sv0=val0,sv1=val1 \  
    --rest-api-id 4wk1k4onj3 \
    --stage-name beta
The command returns a representation of the base version deployment:
{
    "id": "cifeiw", 
    "createdDate": 1511380879
}
The associated beta stage does not have any canary settings:
{
    "stageName": "beta", 
    "variables": {
        "sv0": "val0", 
        "sv1": "val1"
    }, 
    "cacheClusterEnabled": false, 
    "cacheClusterStatus": "NOT_AVAILABLE", 
    "deploymentId": "cifeiw", 
    "lastUpdatedDate": 1511380879, 
    "createdDate": 1511380879, 
    "methodSettings": {}
}
Now, create a new canary release deployment by attaching a canary on the stage:
aws apigateway update-stage  \
    --patch-operations '[{ \
        "op":"replace", \
        "path":"/canarySettings/percentTraffic", \
        "value":"10.5" \
    },{ \
        "op":"replace", \
        "path":"/canarySettings/useStageCache", \
        "value":"false" \
    },{ \
        "op":"replace", \
        "path":"/canarySettings/stageVariableOverrides/sv1", \
        "value":"val2" \
    },{ \
        "op":"replace", \
        "path":"/canarySettings/stageVariableOverrides/sv2", \
        "value":"val3" \
    }]' \
    --rest-api-id 4wk1k4onj3  \
    --stage-name beta
A representation of the updated stage looks like this:
{
    "stageName": "beta", 
    "variables": {
        "sv0": "val0", 
        "sv1": "val1"
    }, 
    "cacheClusterEnabled": false, 
    "cacheClusterStatus": "NOT_AVAILABLE", 
    "deploymentId": "cifeiw", 
    "lastUpdatedDate": 1511381930, 
    "createdDate": 1511380879, 
    "canarySettings": {
        "percentTraffic": 10.5, 
        "deploymentId": "cifeiw", 
        "useStageCache": false, 
        "stageVariableOverrides": {
            "sv2": "val3", 
            "sv1": "val2"
        }
    }, 
    "methodSettings": {}
}
Because we just enabled a canary on an existing version of the API, both the production release (Stage) and canary release (canarySettings) point to the same deployment, i.e., the same version (deploymentId) of the API. After you change the API and deploy it to this stage again, the new version will be in the canary release, while the base version remains in the production release. This is manifested in the stage evolution when the deploymentId in the canary release is updated to the new deployment id and the deploymentId in the production release remains unchanged.
