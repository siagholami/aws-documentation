Configuring a REST API using OpenAPI
You can use API Gateway to import a REST API from an external definition file into API Gateway. Currently, API Gateway supports OpenAPI v2.0 and OpenAPI v3.0 definition files. You can update an API by overwriting it with a new definition, or you can merge a definition with an existing API. You specify the options by using a mode query parameter in the request URL. 
For a tutorial on using the Import API feature from the API Gateway console, see Tutorial: Create a REST API by importing an example.
