Tagging your API Gateway resources
A tag is a metadata label that you assign or that AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag has two parts:
 A tag key (for example, CostCenter, Environment, or Project). Tag keys are case sensitive.
 An optional field known as a tag value (for example, 111122223333 or Production). Omitting the tag value is the same as using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are case-sensitive.
Tags help you do the following:
 Control access to your resources based on the tags that are assigned to them. You control access by specifying tag keys and values in the conditions for an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy.  For more information about tag-based access control, see Controlling Access Using Tags in the IAM User Guide.
 Track your AWS costs. You activate these tags on the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard. AWS uses the tags to categorize your costs and deliver a monthly cost allocation report to you. For more information, see Use Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
 Identify and organize your AWS resources. Many AWS services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you could assign the same tag to an API Gateway stage that you assign to a CloudWatch Events rule.
For tips on using tags, see the AWS Tagging Strategies post on the AWS Answers blog.
