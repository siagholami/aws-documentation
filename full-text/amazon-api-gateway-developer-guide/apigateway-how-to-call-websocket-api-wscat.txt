Use wscat to connect to a WebSocket API and send messages to it
The [wscat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat) utility is a convenient tool for testing a WebSocket API that you have created and deployed in API Gateway. You can install and use wscat as follows:


Download wscat from https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat.


Install wscat by running the following command:


npm install -g wscat

To connect to your API, run the wscat command as shown in the following example. Note that this example assumes that the Authorization setting is NONE.

wscat -c wss://aabbccddee.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test/
You need to replace aabbccddee with the actual API ID, which is displayed in the API Gateway console or returned by the AWS CLI https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/aws-cli/apigatewayv2-2018-11-29/CreateApi command.
In addition, if your API is in a Region other than us-east-1, you need to substitute the correct Region.

To test your API, enter a message such as the following while connected:

{"{jsonpath-expression}":"{route-key}"}
where {jsonpath-expression} is a JSONPath expression and {route-key} is a route key for the API. For example:
{"action":"action1"}
   {"message":"test response body"}
For more information about JSONPath, see JSONPath or JSONPath for Java.

To disconnect from your API, enter ctrl-C.
