Testing CORS
You can test your API's CORS configuration by invoking your API, and checking the CORS headers in the response. The following curl command sends an OPTIONS request to a deployed API. 
curl -v -X OPTIONS https://{restapi_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage_name}
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Date: Tue, 19 May 2020 00:55:22 GMT
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 0
< Connection: keep-alive
< x-amzn-RequestId: a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-abc123
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
< Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,Authorization,X-Amz-Date,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token
< x-amz-apigw-id: Abcd=
< Access-Control-Allow-Methods: DELETE,GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PATCH,POST,PUT
The Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, and Access-Control-Allow-Methods headers in the response show that the API supports CORS. For more information, see Enabling CORS for a REST API resource.
