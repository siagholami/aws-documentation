Steps to configure a usage plan
The following steps outline how you, as the API owner, create and configure a usage plan for your customers.
To configure a usage plan


Create one or more APIs, configure the methods to require an API key, and deploy the APIs to stages.


Generate or import API keys to distribute to application developers (your customers) who will be using your API.


Create the usage plan with the desired throttle and quota limits.


Associate API stages and API keys with the usage plan.


Callers of the API must supply an assigned API key in the x-api-key header in requests to the API.
Note
To include API methods in a usage plan, you must configure individual API methods to require an API key. For user authentication and authorization, don't use API keys. Use an IAM role, a Lambda authorizer, or an Amazon Cognito user pool.
