Receive an API response with a compressed payload
When making a request on a compression-enabled API, the client can choose to receive a compressed response payload of a specific format by specifying an Accept-Encoding header with a supported content coding. 
API Gateway only compresses the response payload when the following conditions are satisfied:
  The incoming request has the Accept-Encoding header with a supported content coding and format. 
Note
If the header is not set, the default value is * as defined in RFC 7231. In such a case, API Gateway does not compress the payload. Some browser or client may add Accept-Encoding (for example, Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate, br) automatically to compression-enabled requests. This can trigger the payload compression in API Gateway. Without an explicit specification of supported Accept-Encoding header values, API Gateway does not compress the payload. 
  The minimumCompressionSize is set on the API to enable compression.
  The integration response doesn't have a Content-Encoding header. 
  The size of an integration response payload, after the applicable mapping template is applied, is greater than or equal to the specified minimumCompressionSize value.
API Gateway applies any mapping template that's configured for the integration response before compressing the payload. If the integration response contains a Content-Encoding header, API Gateway assumes that the integration response payload is already compressed and skips the compression processing.
An example is the PetStore API example and the following request:
GET /pets
Host: {petstore-api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com
Accept: application/json
The backend responds to the request with an uncompressed JSON payload that's similar to the following:
```
200 OK
[
  { 
    "id": 1, 
    "type": "dog", 
    "price": 249.99 
  }, 
  { 
    "id": 2, 
    "type": "cat", 
    "price": 124.99 
  }, 
  { 
    "id": 3, 
    "type": "fish", 
    "price": 0.99 
  } 
]
```
To receive this output as a compressed payload, your API client can submit a request as follows:
GET /pets
Host: {petstore-api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com
Accept-Encoding:gzip
The client receives the response with a Content-Encoding header and GZIP-encoded payload that are similar to the following: 
```
200 OK
Content-Encoding:gzip
...

```
When the response payload is compressed, only the compressed data size is billed for data transfer.
