Infrastructure security in Amazon API Gateway
As a managed service, Amazon API Gateway is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes whitepaper.
You use AWS published API calls to access API Gateway through the network. Clients must support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 or later. We recommend TLS 1.2 or later. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.
Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal. Or you can use the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests.
You can call these API operations from any network location, but API Gateway does support resource-based access policies, which can include restrictions based on the source IP address. You can also use resource-based policies to control access from specific Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints or specific VPCs. Effectively, this isolates network access to a given API Gateway resource from only the specific VPC within the AWS network.
