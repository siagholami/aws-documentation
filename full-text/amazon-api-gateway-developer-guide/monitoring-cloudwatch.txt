Monitoring REST API execution with Amazon CloudWatch metrics
You can monitor API execution by using CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from API Gateway into readable, near-real-time metrics. These statistics are recorded for a period of 15 months so you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing. By default, API Gateway metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch in one-minute periods. For more information, see What Is Amazon CloudWatch? in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
The metrics reported by API Gateway provide information that you can analyze in different ways. The following list shows some common uses for the metrics that are suggestions to get you started:
 Monitor the IntegrationLatency metrics to measure the responsiveness of the backend.
 Monitor the Latency metrics to measure the overall responsiveness of your API calls.
 Monitor the CacheHitCount and CacheMissCount metrics to optimize cache capacities to achieve a desired performance.
