Set up API keys using the API Gateway REST API
To set up API keys, do the following:
 Configure API methods to require an API key.
 Create or import an API key for the API in a region.
Before setting up API keys, you must have created an API and deployed it to a stage. 
For the REST API calls to create and deploy an API, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/link-relation/restapi-create/ and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/link-relation/deployment-create/, respectively.
