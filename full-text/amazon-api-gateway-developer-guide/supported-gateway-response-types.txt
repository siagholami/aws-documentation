Gateway response types
API Gateway exposes the following gateway responses for customization by API developers. 



Gateway response type
Default status code
Description




ACCESS_DENIED
403
The gateway response for authorization failure—for example, when access is denied by a custom or Amazon Cognito authorizer. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_4XX type.


API_CONFIGURATION_ERROR
500
The gateway response for an invalid API configuration—including when an invalid endpoint address is submitted, when base64 decoding fails on binary data when binary support is enacted, or when integration response mapping can't match any template and no default template is configured. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_5XX type.


AUTHORIZER_CONFIGURATION_ERROR
500
The gateway response for failing to connect to a custom or Amazon Cognito authorizer. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_5XX type.


AUTHORIZER_FAILURE
500
The gateway response when a custom or Amazon Cognito authorizer failed to authenticate the caller. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_5XX type.


BAD_REQUEST_PARAMETERS
400
The gateway response when the request parameter cannot be validated according to an enabled request validator. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_4XX type.


BAD_REQUEST_BODY
400
The gateway response when the request body cannot be validated according to an enabled request validator. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_4XX type.


DEFAULT_4XX
Null
The default gateway response for an unspecified response type with the status code of 4XX. Changing the status code of this fallback gateway response changes the status codes of all other 4XX responses to the new value. Resetting this status code to null reverts the status codes of all other 4XX responses to their original values.


DEFAULT_5XX
Null
The default gateway response for an unspecified response type with a status code of 5XX. Changing the status code of this fallback gateway response changes the status codes of all other 5XX responses to the new value. Resetting this status code to null reverts the status codes of all other 5XX responses to their original values.


EXPIRED_TOKEN
403
The gateway response for an AWS authentication token expired error. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_4XX type.


INTEGRATION_FAILURE
504
The gateway response for an integration failed error. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_5XX type.


INTEGRATION_TIMEOUT
504
The gateway response for an integration timed out error. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_5XX type.


INVALID_API_KEY
403
The gateway response for an invalid API key submitted for a method requiring an API key. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_4XX type.


INVALID_SIGNATURE

The gateway response for an invalid AWS signature error. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_4XX type.


MISSING_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN

The gateway response for the usage plan quota exceeded error. If the response type is unspecified, this response defaults to the DEFAULT_4XX type.

UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE
