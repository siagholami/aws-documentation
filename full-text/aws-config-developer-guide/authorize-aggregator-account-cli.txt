Authorizing Aggregator Accounts to Collect AWS Config Configuration and Compliance Data Using the AWS Command Line Interface
You can authorize aggregator accounts to collect AWS Config data from source accounts and delete aggregator accounts using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). To use the AWS Management Console, see Authorizing Aggregator Accounts to Collect AWS Config Configuration and Compliance Data Using the Console.
The AWS CLI is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and use scripts to automate them.
To install the AWS CLI on your local machine, see Installing the AWS CLI in the AWS CLI User Guide.
If necessary, type aws configure to configure the AWS CLI to use an AWS Region where AWS Config aggregators are available.
