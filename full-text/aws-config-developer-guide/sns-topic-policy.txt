Required Permissions for the Amazon SNS Topic When Using IAM Roles
You can attach a permission policy to the Amazon SNS topic owned by a different account. If you want to use an Amazon SNS topic from another account, make sure to attach the following policy to an existing Amazon SNS topic.
{
  "Id": "Policy1415489375392",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AWSConfigSNSPolicy20150201",
      "Action": [
        "SNS:Publish"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:myTopic",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "account-id1",
          "account-id2",
          "account-id3"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
For the Resource key, account-id is the account number of the topic owner. For account-id1, account-id2, and account-id3, use the AWS accounts that will send data to an Amazon SNS topic. You must substitute appropriate values for region and myTopic. 
Required Permissions for the Amazon SNS Topic When Using Service-Linked Roles
If you set up AWS Config using a service-linked role, you need to attach a permission policy to the Amazon SNS topic. If you want to use an Amazon SNS topic from your own account, make sure to attach the following policy to an existing Amazon SNS topic.
{
  "Id": "Policy_ID",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AWSConfigSNSPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "[configRoleArn]"
      },
      "Action": "SNS:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:myTopic",
    }
  ]
}
You must substitute appropriate values for region, account-id, and myTopic.
Note
AWS Config does not recommend using a service-linked role when using Amazon SNS topic from other accounts.
Troubleshooting for the Amazon SNS Topic
AWS Config must have permissions to send notifications to an Amazon SNS topic. If an Amazon SNS topic cannot receive notifications, verify that the IAM role that AWS Config was assuming must have sns:publish permissions.
