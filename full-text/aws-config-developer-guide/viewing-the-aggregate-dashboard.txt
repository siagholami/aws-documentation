Viewing Configuration and Compliance Data in the Aggregated View
The Aggregated view displays the configuration data of AWS resources and provides an overview of your rules and their compliance state. 
It provides the total resource count of AWS resources. The resource types and source accounts are ranked by the highest number of resources. It also provides a count of compliant and noncompliant rules. The noncompliant rules are ranked by highest number of noncompliant resources and source accounts with highest number of noncompliant rules. 
After setup, AWS Config starts aggregating data from the specified source accounts into an aggregator. It might take a few minutes for AWS Config to display the compliance status of rules on this page.
