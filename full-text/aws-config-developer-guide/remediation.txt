Remediating Noncompliant AWS Resources by AWS Config Rules
AWS Config allows you to remediate noncompliant resources that are evaluated by AWS Config Rules. AWS Config applies remediation using AWS Systems Manager Automation documents. These documents define the actions to be performed on noncompliant AWS resources evaluated by AWS Config Rules. You can associate SSM documents by using AWS Management Console or by using APIs.
AWS Config provides a set of managed automation documents with remediation actions. You can also create and associate custom automation documents with AWS Config rules. 
To apply remediation on noncompliant resources, you can either choose the remediation action you want to associate from a prepopulated list or create your own custom remediation actions using SSM documents. AWS Config provides a recommended list of remediation action in the AWS Management Console. 
In the AWS Management Console, you can either choose to manually or automatically remediate noncompliant resources by associating remediation actions with AWS Config rules. With all remediation actions, you can either choose manual or automatic remediation.

Prerequisite
Before you begin to apply remediation on noncompliant resources, you must select a rule and set up remediation (manual or auto) for the rule.
Setting Up Manual Remediation (Console)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Config console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/.


Choose Rules on the left and then on the Rules page, choose Add Rule to add new rules to the rule list. 


For existing rules, select the noncompliant rule from the rule list and choose Edit.

On the Edit name of the rule page, in the Choose remediation action section, choose the appropriate remediation action from the recommended list.

Depending on the selected remediation action, you see specific parameters or no parameters.

(Optional): If you want to pass the resource ID of noncompliant resources to the remediation action, choose Resource ID parameter. If selected, at runtime that parameter is substituted with the ID of the resource to be remediated.

Each parameter has either a static value or a dynamic value. If you do not choose a specific resource ID parameter from the drop-down list, you can enter values for each key. If you choose a resource ID parameter from the drop-down list, you can enter values for all the other keys except the selected resource ID parameter. 

Choose Save. The Rules page is displayed.

Setting Up Auto Remediation (Console)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Config console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/.


Choose Rules on the left and then on the Rules page, choose Add Rule to add new rules to the rule list. 


For existing rules, select the noncompliant rule from the rule list and choose Edit.

On the Edit name of the rule page, in the Choose remediation action section, choose the appropriate remediation action from the recommended list.

Depending on the selected remediation action, you see specific parameters or no parameters.

Choose Auto remediation to automatically remediate noncompliant resources.

If a resource is still non-compliant after auto remediation, you can set the rule to try auto remediation again. Enter the desired retries and seconds.
Note
There are costs associated with running a remediation script multiple times.

(Optional): If you want to pass the resource ID of noncompliant resources to the remediation action, choose Resource ID parameter. If selected, at runtime that parameter is substituted with the ID of the resource to be remediated.

Each parameter has either a static value or a dynamic value. If you do not choose a specific resource ID parameter from the drop-down list, you can enter values for each key. If you choose a resource ID parameter from the drop-down list, you can enter values for all the other keys except the selected resource ID parameter. 

Choose Save. The Rules page is displayed.

Setting Up and Applying a Remediation Action Remediation Using Rules and Resources (Console)
You can also set up remediation from the Rules and the Resources pages. The following procedures provide more details about each workflow.
Using Rules
You can apply a remediation action to a noncompliant rule from Rules on the left.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Config console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/.


Choose Rules on the left and then on the Rules page, choose Add Rule to add new rules to the rule list.


For existing rules, select the noncompliant rule from the rule list and choose Edit.

Choose Manage remediation* and on the **Manage remediation: name of the rule* page, select the appropriate remediation action from the recommended list. The remediation actions are related to AWS Systems Manager automation documents.

Depending on the selected remediation action, you will see either specific parameters or no parameters.

If you want to pass the resource ID of noncompliant resources to the remediation action, choose Resource ID parameter. If selected, at runtime that parameter is substituted with the ID of the resource to be remediated.

Each parameter has either a static value or a dynamic value. If you do not choose a specific resource ID parameter from the drop-down list, you can enter values for each key. If you choose a resource ID parameter from the drop-down list, you can enter values for all the other keys except the selected resource ID parameter. 


Choose Save.


In the Choose resources in scope section, choose all the noncompliant resources. The resources in scope include those resources where this rule is applied and their compliance status.


For more information about a resource, choose Resource actions and either choose View details, Configuration timeline, or Compliance timeline.

Choose Remediate.

If the resources are remediated, the resource compliance status is compliant. To view the compliant resources, select Compliant from the compliance status list.
If the resources are not remediated, the action status column displays  Action execution failed (details). Choose (details) to view the main action steps invoked during the execution of the remediation action and the status of each action step. 
Note
For troubleshooting failed remediation actions, you can run the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) command describe-remediation-execution-status to get detailed view of a Remediation Execution for a set of resources. The details include state, timestamps for remediation execution steps, and any error messages for the failed steps.
Using Resources
You can also apply a remediation action to a noncompliant rule from Resources on the left.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Config console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/.


Choose Resources on the left and then on the Resource inventory page, Resources is selected by default.


Select one or more resources from the resource type and choose Look up.


Choose the name of the appropriate noncompliant resource from the resource table.


On the Resource details:  name of the resource page, choose one or more noncompliant rules from the rules in scope.


Choose Rule actions and select Manage remediation. 


On the Manage remediation: name of the rule page, select the appropriate remediation action.


Depending on the selected remediation action, you will see either specific parameters or no parameters.

If you want to pass the resource ID of noncompliant resources to the remediation action, choose Resource ID parameter. If selected, at runtime that parameter is substituted with the ID of the resource to be remediated.

Each parameter has either a static value or a dynamic value. If you do not choose a specific resource ID parameter from the drop-down list, you can enter values for each key. If you choose a resource ID parameter from the drop-down list, you can enter values for all the other keys except the selected resource ID parameter. 


Choose Save.
