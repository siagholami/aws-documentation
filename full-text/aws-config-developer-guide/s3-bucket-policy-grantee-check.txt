s3-bucket-policy-grantee-check
Checks that the access granted by the Amazon S3 bucket is restricted by any of the AWS principals, federated users, service principals, IP addresses, or VPCs that you provide. The rule is COMPLIANT if a bucket policy is not present.
For example, if the input parameter to the rule is the list of two principals: 111122223333 and 444455556666 and the bucket policy specifies that only 111122223333 can access the bucket, then the rule is COMPLIANT. With the same input parameters: If the bucket policy specifies that 111122223333 and 444455556666 can access the bucket, it is also compliant. However, if the bucket policy specifies that 999900009999 can access the bucket, the rule is NON-COMPLIANT. 
Note
If a bucket policy contains more than one statement, each statement in the bucket policy is evaluated against this rule.
