cloudformation-stack-drift-detection-check
Checks whether an AWS CloudFormation stack's actual configuration differs, or has drifted, from it's expected configuration. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources differ from their expected configuration. The rule and the stack are COMPLIANT when the stack drift status is IN_SYNC. The rule and the stack are NON_COMPLIANT when the stack drift status is DRIFTED. 
Note
If the stacks you created are not visible, choose Re-evaluate and check again.
This rule depends on the DetectStackDrift API availability. Based on the stack configuration, you may experience throttling. AWS Config defaults the rule to NON_COMPLIANT when there is throttling.
