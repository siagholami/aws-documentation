*AWS Config records the configuration details of Dedicated hosts and the instances that you launch on them. As a result, you can use AWS Config as a data source when you report compliance with your server-bound software licenses. For example, you can view the configuration history of an instance and determine which Amazon Machine Image (AMI) it is based on. Then, you can look up the configuration history of the host, which includes details such as the numbers of sockets and cores, to verify that the host complies with the license requirements of the AMI. For more information, see Tracking Configuration Changes with AWS Config  in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
