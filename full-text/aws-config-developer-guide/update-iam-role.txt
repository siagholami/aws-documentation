Updating the IAM Role Assigned to AWS Config
You can update the IAM role assumed by AWS Config any time. Before you update the IAM role, ensure that you have created a new role to replace the old one. You must attach policies to the new role that grant permissions to AWS Config to record configurations and deliver them to your delivery channel. In addition, make sure to copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your new IAM role. You will need it to update the IAM role. For information about creating an IAM role and attaching the required policies to the IAM role, see Creating an IAM Role.
Note
To find the ARN of an existing IAM role, go to the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/. Choose Roles in the navigation pane. Then choose the name of the desired role and find the ARN at the top of the Summary page.
Updating the IAM Role
You can update your IAM role using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.
