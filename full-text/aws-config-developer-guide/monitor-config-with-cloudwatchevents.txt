Monitoring AWS Config with Amazon CloudWatch Events
Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to detect and react to changes in the status of AWS Config events.
You can create a rule that runs whenever there is a state transition, or when there is a transition to one or more states that are of interest. Then, based on rules you create, Amazon CloudWatch Events invokes one or more target actions when an event matches the values you specify in a rule. Depending on the type of event, you might want to send notifications, capture event information, take corrective action, initiate events, or take other actions. 
Before you create event rules for AWS Config, however, you should do the following: 
 Familiarize yourself with events, rules, and targets in CloudWatch Events. For more information, see What Is Amazon CloudWatch Events?
 For more information about how to get started with CloudWatch Events and set up rules, see Getting Started with CloudWatch Events.
 Create the target or targets you will use in your event rules.

Creating Amazon CloudWatch Events Rule for AWS Config
Use the following steps to create a CloudWatch Events rule that triggers on an event emitted by AWS Config.


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Events.


Choose Create rule.


On the Step 1: Create rule page, for Service Name, choose Config.


For Event Type, choose the event type that triggers the rule:
    Choose All Events to make a rule that applies to all AWS services. If you choose this option, you cannot choose specific message types, rule names, resource types, or resource IDs.
    Choose AWS API Call via CloudTrail to base rules on API calls made to this service. For more information about creating this type of rule, see Creating a CloudWatch Events Rule That Is Triggered on an AWS API Call Using AWS CloudTrail.
    Choose Config Configuration Item Change to get notifications when a resource in your account changes.
    Choose Config Rules Compliance Change to get notifications when a compliance check to your rules fails.
    Choose Config Rules Re-evaluation Status to get reevaluation status notifications. 
    Choose Config Configuration Snapshot Delivery Status to get configuration snapshot delivery status notifications.
    Choose Config Configuration History Delivery Status to get configuration history delivery status notifications.


Choose Any message type to receive notifications of any type. Choose Specific message type(s) to receive the following types of notifications:
    If you choose ConfigurationItemChangeNotification, you receive messages when AWS Config successfully delivers the configuration snapshot to your Amazon S3 bucket.
    If you choose ComplianceChangeNotification, you receive messages when the compliance type of a resource that AWS Config evaluates has changed.
    If you choose ConfigRulesEvaluationStarted, you receive messages when AWS Config starts evaluating your rule against the specified resources.
    If you choose ConfigurationSnapshotDeliveryCompleted, you receive messages when AWS Config successfully delivers the configuration snapshot to your Amazon S3 bucket.
    If you choose ConfigurationSnapshotDeliveryFailed, you receive messages when AWS Config fails to deliver the configuration snapshot to your Amazon S3 bucket.
    If you choose ConfigurationSnapshotDeliveryStarted, you receive messages when AWS Config starts delivering the configuration snapshot to your Amazon S3 bucket.
    If you choose ConfigurationHistoryDeliveryCompleted, you receive messages when AWS Config successfully delivers the configuration history to your Amazon S3 bucket.


If you chose a specific event type from the Event Type drop-down list, choose Any resource type to make a rule that applies to all AWS Config supported resource types.


Or choose Specific resource type(s), and then type the AWS Config supported resource type (for example, AWS::EC2::Instance).

If you chose a specific event type from the Event Type drop-down list, choose Any resource ID to include any AWS Config supported resource ID.

Or choose Specific resource ID(s), and then type the AWS Config supported resource ID (for example, i-04606de676e635647).

If you chose a specific event type from the Event Type drop-down list, choose Any rule name to include any AWS Config supported rule.

Or choose Specific rule name(s), and then type the AWS Config supported rule (for example, required-tags).


Review your rule setup to make sure it meets your event-monitoring requirements.


In the Targets area, choose Add target*.


In the Select target type list, choose the type of target you have prepared to use with this rule, and then configure any additional options required by that type.


Choose Configure details.


On the Configure rule details page, type a name and description for the rule, and then choose the State box to enable the rule as soon as it is created.


Choose Create rule to confirm your selection.
