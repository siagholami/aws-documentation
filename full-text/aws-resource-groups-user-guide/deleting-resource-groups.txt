Delete groups from AWS Resource Groups
You can use the Resource Groups console or the AWS CLI to delete resource groups from AWS Resource Groups. Deleting a resource group does not delete the resources that are members of the group or tags on member resources. It deletes only the group structure and any group-level tags.
To delete resource groups (AWS Management Console)


From the Resource Groups drop-down menu on the AWS home page, choose Saved Resource Groups.


Choose the resource group that you want to delete.


On the group's detail page, choose Delete.



When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, choose Delete.


To delete resource groups (AWS CLI)

Type the following command, replacing resource_group_name with the name of your group, and then press Enter.

$ aws resource-groups delete-group \
       --group-name resource_group_name

When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, type yes, and then press Enter.
