Saving Slice Changes
If you modify one of the lamps you just placed, you can save the changes to all of the lamp slice instances. This means, for example, that you can make one of the lamps larger; when you save that change, all the other placed lamps become larger as well.
To change the lamp's size and save the changes


In the Entity Outliner, select one of the lamp slices. Click the arrow icon to expand the parent entity. This displays the entities in the slice. In this lamp slice, there is only one entity. Select the entity gsg_maze_floodlight. 



In the Entity Inspector, change the Scale values:
    x: 1.25
    y: 1.25
    z: 1.25



In the Entity Outliner, select the parent node Lamp. Right-click, point to Save slice overrides and then choose maze_lamp.slice.



Observe how all of the lamps are updated to the new scale. The editor has saved this update to the slice, and all slice instances are automatically updated to reflect those changes.


Press CtrlS to save your level.


Press CtrlG to play your level.
