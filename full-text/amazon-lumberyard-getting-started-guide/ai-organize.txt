Organizing Your AI Entities
Keeping your entities organized helps you to manage your assets as you build the rest of the level.
In this tutorial you create a parent entity and then place all the AI entities into it.
To organize your AI entities

Press CtrlS to save your level.


Press CtrlG to play your level.


Press Esc to quit.
