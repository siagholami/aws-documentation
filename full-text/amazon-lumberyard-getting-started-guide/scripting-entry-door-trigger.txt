Creating the Trigger Volume
A trigger area is an invisible cube that you can set to trigger an action when a gameplay character enters and exits an area. You create a box-shaped trigger area and then move it to just outside of the maze door.
To create a trigger area


In the Entity Outliner, right-click the EntryDoor_Parent entity, and then select Create child entity.



In the Entity Inspector, rename this new entity EntryDoor_Trigger.



Ensure that the EntryDoor_Trigger is selected in the Entity Outliner. In the Entity Inspector, click Add Component. Under Scripting, select Trigger Area.



When adding any component that requires another component to function properly, the Entity Inspector displays a message: "This component is missing a required component service and has been disabled." To properly use the Trigger Area component, you must also add a shape component. 


Click Add Required Component, and then click Box Shape.



Set the box shape's Dimensions to X: 4.00 m, Y: 4.00 m, Z: 5.00 m.



Use the Move tool to adjust the position of the box-shaped trigger area so that it is just outside of the door. Align its edge with the inside edge of the door.



When the player walks toward the door and into the trigger area, the entry trigger action occurs—in this case, the door opens. The player then walks through the door, exiting the trigger volume, causing the exit trigger action—the door closes. This trigger area currently has no triggers set up; you do this in the next section.
