Instantiating Prebuilt Slices
In this tutorial, you instantiate, or place, two previously created slices into the perspective viewport: the exterior maze walls and the interior maze walls. 


In the Asset Browser, navigate to the StarterGame\Slices\GSG directory, and then select and drag the Maze_Wall_Exterior.slice into the viewport.



In the same StarterGame\Slices\GSG directory, select and drag the Maze_Wall_Interior.slice into the viewport.



Press CtrlS to save your level.
