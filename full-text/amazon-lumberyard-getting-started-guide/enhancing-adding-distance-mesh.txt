Adding a Distance Mesh
You can create an enclosed feel to your level by adding a distance mesh. This fills in the empty area in the distance by blocking the view with large industrial structures. This also serves to enclose the gameplay area. 

To add a distance mesh

In the Asset Browser, navigate to slices/GSG/.

Drag maze_distance_structure.slice into your viewport. 


Move the large wall and buildings to the left of the maze's entrance. 

Adjust the structure so that the walls touch the hillsides on both ends.
It should look similar to the following image. 


(Optional) You can add even more details and visual interest. Experiment with adding the following assets: 
    Additional pipes and steam leaks.
    Crates in the maze path. 
    Destroyed robots: StarterGame/Objects/BrokenRobots.
    Any interesting object, decals, and particles that you find in the asset library.

Have fun!
