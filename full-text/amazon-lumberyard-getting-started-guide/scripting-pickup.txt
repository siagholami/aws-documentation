Adding a Pickup Item
Now you add an item in the maze that the player must pick up before exiting the maze. The pickup item is a prebuilt slice that you access through the Asset Browser. After you place the pickup item slice, you customize the Lua Script component.
To place a pickup item

In the Asset Browser, navigate to StarterGame\Slices\GSG. 

Select maze_pickupobjective.slice and drag it into your viewport, into the far corner of the maze.


The maze_pickupobjective.slice has a number of components and several entities. You modify the properties on one of these components.

In the Entity Outliner, select the Maze_PickupObjective slice.



In the Entity Inspector, in the bottommost Lua Script component, under Recipients, next to Entity, click the picker .



In the Entity Outliner, under ExitDoor_Parent, select Exitdoor_Script. 



You now have a pickup that, when retrieved, allows the player to exit the maze.

Press CtrlS to save your level.
