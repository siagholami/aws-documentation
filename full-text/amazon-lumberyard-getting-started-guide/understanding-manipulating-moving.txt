Moving an Object
You can move the currently selected object in your viewport. When you move an object with the Move tool, you can choose to move the object along the following:
 An axis (X, Y, or Z) – X and Y can be thought of as latitude and longitude, and Z as elevation.
For example, if you move along X, you move your object forward and backward only. 
If you move along Y, you move your object left and right only. 
And if you move along Z, you move your object up and down only.
 A plane (XY, YZ, XZ) – Move your object along two axes, or in two different directions, without moving it in the third.
For example, if you choose the XY plane, you can move the object in the X and Y directions but not the Z direction. You can change its position anywhere on a flat landscape.
If you choose the YZ or XZ plane, you can move the object as if it were against a wall. YZ and XZ can be thought of as walls that are perpendicular to one another.

To choose the axis or plane along which you want to move the object, move your mouse pointer over the gizmo until the plane or axis that you want is highlighted. Click to select it and then drag to move it.
To move a selected object


If your boulder is not still selected from the previous tutorial, select it.


Press 2 on your keyboard to activate the Move tool. Or you can click the Move icon on the top toolbar.



When your boulder is selected with the Move tool, it looks like the following image.


Move your mouse pointer over the gizmo until the Z axis is selected. Click to select and then drag upward. Your boulder appears to float.


Move it back down to sit partially beneath the ground.

Move your cursor over the gizmo until the small square indicating the XY plane is selected. Drag it to a different location along the ground.
