Adding Ambient Particles
You can use the particle system to add ambient particles floating through the air. The steps in this procedure are similar to the previous procedure.
To add ambient particles to the air


On the outside of the maze, near your player character, right-click and choose Create entity.



In the Entity Inspector, click Add Component. Under Rendering, click Particle. 


In the Particle component's properties, next to the Particle effects library box, click the browse (â€¦) button. 



In the Pick Particle dialog box, navigate to Game/libs/particles/. 
Select ambientfx.xml and click OK.


In the Entity Inspector, in the Particle component's properties, for Emitters select FlyingSeeds.FlyingSeeds from the particles list.

You now see little seeds floating slowly through the air. 



Duplicate this entity (CtrlD) and place them in several locations around the level. 


Press CtrlS to save your level.
