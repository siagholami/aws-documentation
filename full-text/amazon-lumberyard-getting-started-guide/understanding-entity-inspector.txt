6: Entity Inspector

The Entity Inspector (on the right side of the viewport) displays all the components for the currently selected entity in the Entity Outliner (on the left side of the viewport). You use the Entity Inspector to add and remove components and to modify settings on components. This gives the entity customized abilities, such as triggering a particular action, making sounds, colliding with other objects, and so on.
For more information about the Entity Inspector, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/component-entity-inspector.html in the Amazon Lumberyard User Guide.
