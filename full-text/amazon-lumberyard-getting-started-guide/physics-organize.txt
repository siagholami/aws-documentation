Stacking the Crates and Barrels to Make a Wall
First you organize the crate and barrels by placing them into a parent entity and then moving the parent entity to a place in the maze where you build the wall.
Then you duplicate the crate and barrels and stack them upon each other to create the wall.
To parent your crate and barrels


In the viewport, near where you put your crate and barrels, right-click and choose Create entity.



In the Entity Inspector, name the new entity CrateWallParent. 



In the Entity Outliner, drag the barrel and crates entities into CrateWallParent.



In the viewport, use the Move tool to drag CrateWallParent to where you want to place your wall within the maze.



In the Entity Outliner, right-click on one of your crates and choose Duplicate. This creates a duplicate of the object on top of the original object.


In the viewport, use the Move tool to position the duplicated object.
Repeat this step to duplicate and position the crate and barrels until you have a wall four layers high that blocks the passageway.
Tip
You can also duplicate an entity by doing any of the following:
Right-clicking it in the viewport and choosing Duplicate.
Selecting the entity and then pressing CtrlD. Use your mouse pointer to position it in the viewport and then click to place.


Once you have stacked your wall, use the Rotate tool to nudge each object a few degrees along the Z rotation to give the wall the look of randomness.


When complete, your level should look similar to the following image.



Press CtrlS to save your level.


Press CtrlG to play your level.


Find the stack of crates and shoot at them or run into them. Notice how the crates fall and roll based on their density settings.
Press Esc to quit.
