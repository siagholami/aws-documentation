Adding Physics and Mesh Collider Components
As you learned in an earlier tutorial, a character can interact and collide with an object only if the object has collider and physics components. Without these components, a character passes right through the object. 
To add mesh collider and physics components to the door

In the Entity Outliner, select gsg_maze_door.


In the Entity Inspector, click Add Component. Under Physics, select Mesh Collider.


Click Add Component again. Under Physics, select the Static Physics component.
