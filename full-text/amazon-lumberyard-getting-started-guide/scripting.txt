6: Scripting Gameplay
You use Lua script commands to script gameplay events such as triggering doors to open when the game character approaches and to close once he's through. You set up a timer to display in the UI as well as triggers that start and stop it. Finally, you add a pickup item that the character needs to exit the maze.
