Snapping to Grid
The Snap to Grid feature is on by default. With this feature on, you can move an object by aligning it to points along a grid. You can make the grid smaller or larger depending on your needs. The smaller your grid, the finer control you have when moving your objects. The following image shows the boulder being moved along a large grid.

To turn on snap grid and adjust grid size


If your boulder is not still selected from the previous tutorial, select it.


Select the Move tool.


In your top toolbar, locate the Snap to Grid icon. If it has an orange border around it, it is on. If it is off, click to turn it on.


For example, in the following image, Snap to Grid is on.



Click the small arrow on the icon. Choose 4.



Move the boulder in your viewport. Notice how it seems to jump in increments rather than move smoothly.


Turn off Snap to Grid and move your boulder again. Notice how it now moves smoothly for refined placement.


Next, you learn how to rotate your object.
