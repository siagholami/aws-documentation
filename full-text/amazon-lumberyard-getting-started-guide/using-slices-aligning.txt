Aligning the Slices
In this tutorial, you use the Move tool to align your doorway parent slices with the exterior wall's open spaces. Then you use the Align to Object tool to arrange the interior maze walls within the exterior maze walls. The Align to Object tool sets the parent components for the interior and exterior walls to the same relative position. 
To align exterior walls with doorways
 Use the Move and Rotate tools to adjust the exterior wall and both doorways so that they are aligned as in the following picture.
