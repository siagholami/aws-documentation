Placing Crates and Configuring Physics
You use the Asset Browser to find the barrel and crates. You drag them into your viewport and then add the Mesh Collider and Rigid Body Physics components to each, and then configure their density. 
To place crates and barrels


In the Asset Browser, navigate to StarterGame\Objects\ManMade\Props\Barrel. Drag am_barrel_01.cgf into the viewport.



In the Entity Outliner, select the barrel that you just placed.


In the Entity Inspector, in the Transform component's Scale box, set Z to .75.


In the Asset Browser, navigate to StarterGame\Objects\ManMade\Props\Crate. Drag am_crate_01.cfg into the viewport.

Also drag am_crate_long_01_group.cfg into the viewport.


Add a Mesh Collider component and a Rigid Body Physics component to each of the barrel and crates you just placed. And then set the Rigid Body Physics property Density to 15.

To do this, perform the following for each of the three barrel and crates:


In the Entity Outliner, select the barrel or crates.


In the Entity Inspector, click Add Component. Select Mesh Collider.


In the Entity Inspector, click Add Component. Select Rigid Body Physics.


In the Entity Inspector, in the Rigid Body Physics component, set the Density (kg/cubic meter) property to a value between 15 and 25.
The Density value defines the object's weight and affects how much it rolls when struck by the player or weapon fire.
