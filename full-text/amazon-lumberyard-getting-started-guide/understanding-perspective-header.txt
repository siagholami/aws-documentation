5b: Perspective Header

The Perspective header in the upper right corner of the Perspective viewport features displays options and a search bar to filter objects within the viewport. 
Click the "i" icon  to change the level of information displayed in the viewport. Click it multiple times to cycle through the different levels of information.
Click the "?" icon  to show or hide helpers. Helpers are the bounding boxes, icons, and lines that help you recognize different types of objects in your level. 
Turn helpers off to get a clearer picture of what your game looks like. For example, the picture on the top shows the orientation level with helpers turned on. The picture on the bottom shows the same level with helpers turned off.
