Navigating in the Viewport
Lumberyard uses mouse and keyboard navigation controls that are familiar to most gamers.
Like most first-person shooter (FPS) games on a PC, a series of keyboard strokes controls forward, backward, left, and right strafing (movement without changing viewing direction). 
A combination of mouse actions can zoom, change viewing direction, and pan.
