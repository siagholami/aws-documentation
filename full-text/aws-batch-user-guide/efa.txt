Elastic Fabric Adapter
An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network device to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) applications. AWS Batch supports applications that use EFA if the following conditions are met.
 Compute environment contains only supported instance types (c5n.18xlarge, c5n.metal, i3en.24xlarge, m5dn.24xlarge, m5n.24xlarge, r5dn.24xlarge, r5n.24xlarge, and p3dn.24xlarge).
 The OS in the AMI supports EFA: Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6, CentOS 7.6, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04.
 The AMI has the EFA driver loaded.
 The security group for the EFA must allows all inbound and outbound traffic to and from the security group itself.
 All instances that use an EFA should be in the same cluster placement group.
 The job definition must include a devices member with hostPath set to /dev/infiniband/uverbs0 to allow the EFA device to be passed through to the container. If containerPath is specified it must also be set to /dev/infiniband/uverbs0. If permissions is set it must be set to READ | WRITE | MKNOD.
The location of the LinuxParameters member will be different for multi-node parallel jobs and single-node container jobs. The examples below demonstrate the differences but are missing required values.
Example Example for multi-node parallel job 
{
    "jobDefinitionName": "EFA-MNP-JobDef",
    "type": "multinode",
    "nodeProperties": {
      ...
      "nodeRangeProperties": [
        {
          ...
          "container": {
            ...
            "linuxParameters": {
              "devices": [
                {
                  "hostPath": "/dev/infiniband/uverbs0",
                  "containerPath": "/dev/infiniband/uverbs0",
                  "permissions": [
                      "READ", "WRITE", "MKNOD"
                  ]
                },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  }
Example Example for single-node container job 
{
    "jobDefinitionName": "EFA-Container-JobDef",
    "type": "container",
    ...
    "containerProperties": {
      ...
      "linuxParameters": {
        "devices": [
          {
            "hostPath": "/dev/infiniband/uverbs0",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  }
