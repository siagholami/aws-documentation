Job Queue Parameters
Job queues are split into four basic components: the name, state, and priority of the job queue, and the compute environment order.
Job Queue Name
jobQueueName
The name for your job queue. Up to 128 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and underscores are allowed.
Type: String
Required: Yes
State
state
The state of the job queue. If the job queue state is ENABLED (the default value), it is able to accept jobs.
Type: String
Valid values: ENABLED | DISABLED
Required: No
Priority
priority
The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the priority parameter) are evaluated first when associated with same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order, for example, a job queue with a priority value of 10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of 1.
Type: Integer
Required: Yes
Compute Environment Order
computeEnvironmentOrder
The set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. The job scheduler uses this parameter to determine which compute environment should execute a given job. Compute environments must be in the VALID state before you can associate them with a job queue. You can associate up to three compute environments with a job queue.
All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. AWS Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.
Type: Array of ComputeEnvironmentOrder objects
Required: Yes  
computeEnvironment
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.
Type: String
Required: Yes
order
The order of the compute environment. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job placement first.
