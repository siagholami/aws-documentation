AWS Batch Service IAM Role
AWS Batch makes calls to other AWS services on your behalf to manage the resources that you use with the service. Before you can use the service, you must have an IAM policy and role that provides the necessary permissions to AWS Batch.
In most cases, the AWS Batch service role is created for you automatically in the console first-run experience. You can use the following procedure to check if your account already has the AWS Batch service role.
The AWSBatchServiceRole policy is shown below.
