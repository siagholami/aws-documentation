AWS Batch IAM Policies, Roles, and Permissions
By default, IAM users don't have permission to create or modify AWS Batch resources, or perform tasks using the AWS Batch API. This means that they also can't do so using the AWS Batch console or the AWS CLI. To allow IAM users to create or modify resources and submit jobs, you must create IAM policies that grant IAM users permission to use the specific resources and API actions they need. Then, attach those policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions.
When you attach a policy to a user or group of users, it allows or denies the users permissions to perform the specified tasks on the specified resources. For more information, see Permissions and Policies in the IAM User Guide. For more information about managing and creating custom IAM policies, see Managing IAM Policies.
Likewise, AWS Batch makes calls to other AWS services on your behalf, so the service must authenticate with your credentials. This authentication is accomplished by creating an IAM role and policy that can provide these permissions and then associating that role with your compute environments when you create them. For more information, see Amazon ECS Instance Role, IAM Roles, Using Service-Linked Roles, and Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an AWS Service in the IAM User Guide.
