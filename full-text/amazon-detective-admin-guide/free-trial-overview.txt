About the free trial for behavior graphs
Amazon Detective provides a 30-day free trial for each account in each Region. The free trial for an account starts the first time the account performs one of the following actions.
 Enables Detective and becomes the Detective master account for a behavior graph
 Accepts an invitation to be a member account in a behavior graph and is enabled as a member account
The free trial lasts for 30 days from that point. The account is not billed for any data processed during that period. When the trial period ends, Detective begins to bill the account for the data it contributes to behavior graphs.
The same 30-day period is used for all behavior graphs in the Region. For example, an account is enabled as a member account for a behavior graph. This starts the 30-day free trial. After 10 days, the account is enabled for a second behavior graph in the same Region. For the second behavior graph, the account receives 20 days of free data.
The free trial provides multiple benefits:
 Master accounts can explore Detective features and functionality to verify its value.
 Master and member accounts can monitor the amount of data and the estimated cost before Detective begins to bill them for it. See Monitoring usage and cost for a behavior graph (master account) and Monitoring usage and cost across behavior graphs (member account).
