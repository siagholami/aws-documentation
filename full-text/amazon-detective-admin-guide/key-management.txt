Key management for Amazon Detective
Because Detective does not store any personally identifiable customer data, it uses AWS owned customer master keys (CMKs).
This type of CMK can be used across multiple accounts. See the description of AWS owned CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
This type of CMK rotates automatically every three years (1095 days). See the description of key rotation in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
