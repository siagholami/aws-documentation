Managing an Agreement for Multiple Accounts
If you are the owner of the master account of an AWS Organizations organization, you can accept an agreement on behalf of all accounts in your organization. You must be signed in to the master account with the correct AWS Artifact permissions to accept or terminate organization agreements. Users of member accounts with describeOrganizations permissions can view the organization agreements that are accepted on their behalf. 
If your account is not part of an organization, you can create or join an organization by following the instructions in Creating and Managing an AWS Organizations.
Notes
AWS Organizations has two available feature sets: consolidated billing features and all features. To use AWS Artifact for your organization, the organization that you belong to must be enabled for all features. If your organization is configured only for consolidated billing, see Enabling All Features in Your Organization.
If a member account is removed from an organization, that member account will no longer be covered by organization agreements. Master account administrators should communicate this to member accounts before removing member accounts from the organization, so that member accounts can put new agreements in place if necessary. A list of active organization agreements can be viewed in AWS Artifact Organization Agreements.
For more information about AWS Organizations and master accounts, see Managing the AWS Accounts in Your Organization. For more information about setting up an administrator account for AWS Artifact, see Step 1: Create an Administrators Group and Add an IAM User.
