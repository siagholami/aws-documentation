StartApplication
Note
This documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2 of the API supports SQL and Java applications. For more information about version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation.
Starts the specified Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. After creating an application, you must exclusively call this operation to start your application.
After the application starts, it begins consuming the input data, processes it, and writes the output to the configured destination.
The application status must be READY for you to start an application. You can get the application status in the console or using the DescribeApplication operation.
After you start the application, you can stop the application from processing the input by calling the StopApplication operation.
This operation requires permissions to perform the kinesisanalytics:StartApplication action.
