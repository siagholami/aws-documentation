Automatically Scaling Applications to Increase Throughput
Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics elastically scales your application to accommodate the data throughput of your source stream and your query complexity for most scenarios. Kinesis Data Analytics provisions capacity in the form of Kinesis Processing Units (KPU). A single KPU provides you with the memory (4 GB) and corresponding computing and networking.
The default limit for KPUs for your application is eight. For instructions on how to request an increase to this limit, see To request a limit increase in AWS Service Limits.
