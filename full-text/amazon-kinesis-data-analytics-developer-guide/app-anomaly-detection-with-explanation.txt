Example: Detecting Data Anomalies and Getting an Explanation (RANDOM_CUT_FOREST_WITH_EXPLANATION Function)
Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics provides the RANDOM_CUT_FOREST_WITH_EXPLANATION function, which assigns an anomaly score to each record based on values in the numeric columns. The function also provides an explanation of the anomaly. For more information, see RANDOM_CUT_FOREST_WITH_EXPLANATION in the Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics SQL Reference. 
In this exercise, you write application code to obtain anomaly scores for records in your application's streaming source. You also obtain an explanation for each anomaly.
