Step 3: Configure the Application Output
At this point in the Hotspots example, you have Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application code discovering significant hotspots from a streaming source and assigning a heat score to each. 
You can now send the application result from the in-application stream to an external destination, which is another Kinesis data stream (ExampleOutputStream). You can then analyze the hotspot scores and determine what an appropriate threshold is for hotspot heat. You can extend this application further to generate alerts. 
To configure the application output


Open the Kinesis Data Analytics console at  https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics.


In the SQL editor, choose either Destination or Add a destination in the application dashboard. 


On the Add a destination page, choose Select from your streams. Then choose the ExampleOutputStream stream that you created in the preceding section.


Now you have an external destination, where Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics persists any records, your application writes to the in-application stream DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM. 

You can optionally configure AWS Lambda to monitor the ExampleOutputStream stream and send you alerts. For more information, see Using a Lambda Function as Output. You can also review the records that Kinesis Data Analytics writes to the external destination, which is the Kinesis stream ExampleOutputStream, as described in Step 4: Verify the Application Output.
