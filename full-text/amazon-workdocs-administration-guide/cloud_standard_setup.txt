 Before you begin
 Step 1: Launch the Amazon WorkDocs site
 Step 2: Create directory and set administrator

Before you begin

You must meet the prerequisites identified in Simple AD Prerequisites in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide.
If you are part of a compliance program, such as PCI, FedRAMP, or DoD, you must set up a AWS Managed Microsoft AD Directory to meet compliance requirements. For more information, see Getting started with AWS Managed Microsoft AD.
When you launch a new Amazon WorkDocs site, you must specify profile information for the administrator, including first and last name and an email address. 

Step 1: Launch the Amazon WorkDocs site
Follow the steps below to launch your Amazon WorkDocs site using Standard Setup.
To launch the Amazon WorkDocs site

Open the Amazon WorkDocs console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/zocalo/.

If you have never created or connected a directory in the selected Region, you see the Amazon WorkDocs start page. After you create a directory in a particular Region, the start page is no longer available and you see the Manage Your WorkDocs Sites page instead.


Choose Get Started Now from the Amazon WorkDocs start page or choose Create a New WorkDocs Site from the Manage Your WorkDocs Sites page.


On the Get Started with WorkDocs page, next to Standard Setup, choose Launch.


Step 2: Create directory and set administrator
Follow the steps below to create a Simple AD directory and set an administrator.
To create a Simple AD directory


On the Set up a Directory page, choose Create Simple AD.


For Access Point, enter the following values and then choose Continue.
Region
Verify the Region.
Site URL
Enter the URL for your Amazon WorkDocs site.


Enter the following values for Directory Details:
Directory DNS
The fully-qualified name of the directory, such as corp.example.com.
NetBIOS name
The NetBIOS name of the directory, such as CORP.


Enter the following values for Set WorkDocs Administrator:
Email
The email address of the directory administrator, also used as the username. The registration email is sent here.
First Name
The first name of the directory administrator.
Last Name
The last name of the directory administrator.


For VPC Details, select Set up a new VPC on my behalf to have Amazon WorkDocs create and configure a VPC for you. To use an existing VPC instead, select Select an existing VPC to use with WorkDocs and enter the following values.
VPC
The VPC that the directory is created in.
Subnets
The subnets in the VPC that the directory is created in. The two subnets must be in different Availability Zones. If you choose No Preference, two different subnets are randomly selected.


Review the directory information and make any necessary changes. When the information is correct, choose Create Directory.


It takes several minutes for the directory to be connected and the Amazon WorkDocs site to be created. When the directory has been successfully connected, the Status value of the site changes to Active.
Step 3: Complete admin control panel setup
After you receive the administrator registration email, connect to the Amazon WorkDocs site using the client of your choice and complete setup from your admin control panel.
To complete admin control panel setup


In the administrator registration email, use the link to sign in to Amazon WorkDocs.


Under My account, choose Open admin control panel.


Change settings for preferred language, storage, security, and recovery bin. For more information, see Managing site settings.


Under Manage Users, choose Invite Users. You can also edit user settings.
