Site-wide activity feed
Admins can view and export the activity feed for an entire site. To use this feature, you must first install Amazon WorkDocs Companion. To install Amazon WorkDocs Companion, see Apps & Integrations for Amazon WorkDocs.
To view and export a site-wide activity feed


In the web application, choose Activity feed.


Choose Filter, then choose the option to show Site-wide activity.


Select Activity Type filters and choose Date Modified settings as needed, then choose Apply.


When the filtered activity feed results appear, search by file, folder, or user name to narrow your results. You can also add or remove filters as needed.


Choose Export to export the activity feed to .csv and .json files on your desktop. The files are saved in one of the following locations:
    Windows – WorkDocsDownloads folder in your PC's Downloads folder
    macOS – /users/username/WorkDocsDownloads/folder


Any filters you applied are reflected in the exported file.
Note
Users who are not administrators can view and export the activity feed for their own content only. For more information, see Viewing the Activity Feed in the Amazon WorkDocs User Guide.
