 Before you begin
 Step 1: Launch the Amazon WorkDocs site
 Step 2: Enable directory and set administrator
 Step 3: Complete admin control panel setup
Before you begin

You must have an existing AWS Directory Service directory in the current Region. This can be either a Simple AD directory or an AD Connector directory. 
If you are part of a compliance program, such as PCI, FedRAMP, or DoD, you must set up a AWS Managed Microsoft AD Directory to meet compliance requirements. For more information, see Getting started with AWS Managed Microsoft AD.
When you launch a new Amazon WorkDocs site, you must specify profile information for the administrator. This information includes first name, last name, and email address. Do not use Admin for your Amazon WorkDocs account user name. Admin is a reserved user role in Amazon WorkDocs.

Step 1: Launch the Amazon WorkDocs site
Follow the steps below to launch your Amazon WorkDocs site using an existing AWS Directory Service directory.
To launch the Amazon WorkDocs site


Open the Amazon WorkDocs console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/zocalo/.


On the Manage Your WorkDocs Sites page, choose Create a New WorkDocs Site.


Step 2: Enable directory and set administrator
Follow the steps below to enable your existing directory and set an administrator.
To enable an existing directory


On the Select a Directory page, select your AWS Directory Service directory from the Available Directories list and choose Enable Directory.


On the Set WorkDocs Administrator page, enter a username from the AWS Directory Service directory to be your Amazon WorkDocs administrator and choose Select Administrator.


It takes several minutes for the directory to be connected and the Amazon WorkDocs site to be created. When the directory has been successfully connected, the Status value of the site changes to Active.
All the users in the directory are added to your account as active Amazon WorkDocs users, by default. They can sign in and start using Amazon WorkDocs at any time. For more information about user roles, see User roles overview.
Step 3: Complete admin control panel setup
After you receive the administrator registration email, connect to the Amazon WorkDocs site using the client of your choice. Then complete setup from your admin control panel.
To complete admin control panel setup


In the administrator registration email, use the link to sign in to Amazon WorkDocs.


Under My account, choose Open admin control panel.


Change settings for preferred language, storage, security, and recovery bin. For more information, see Managing site settings.


(Optional) Under Manage Users, choose Invite Users. You can also edit user settings.
