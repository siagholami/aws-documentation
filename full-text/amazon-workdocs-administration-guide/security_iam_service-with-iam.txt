Amazon WorkDocs identity-based policies
With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions. Amazon WorkDocs supports specific actions. To learn about the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON policy elements reference in the IAM User Guide.
Actions
The Action element of an IAM identity-based policy describes the specific action or actions that will be allowed or denied by the policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. The action is used in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation. 
Policy actions in Amazon WorkDocs use the following prefix before the action: workdocs:. For example, to grant someone permission to run the Amazon WorkDocs DescribeUsers API operation, you include the workdocs:DescribeUsers action in their policy. Policy statements must include either an Action or NotAction element. Amazon WorkDocs defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can perform with this service.
To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows:
"Action": [
      "workdocs:DescribeUsers",
      "workdocs:CreateUser"
You can specify multiple actions using wildcards (*). For example, to specify all actions that begin with the word Describe, include the following action:
"Action": "workdocs:Describe*"
To see a list of Amazon WorkDocs actions, see Actions defined by Amazon WorkDocs in the IAM User Guide.
Resources
Amazon WorkDocs does not support specifying resource ARNs in a policy.
Condition keys
Amazon WorkDocs does not provide any service-specific condition keys, but it does support using some global condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide.
Examples

Amazon WorkDocs resource-based policies
Amazon WorkDocs does not support resource-based policies.
Authorization based on Amazon WorkDocs tags
Amazon WorkDocs does not support tagging resources or controlling access based on tags.
Amazon WorkDocs IAM roles
An IAM role is an entity within your AWS account that has specific permissions.
Using temporary credentials with Amazon WorkDocs
You can use temporary credentials to sign in with federation, assume an IAM role, or to assume a cross-account role. You obtain temporary security credentials by calling AWS STS API operations such as AssumeRole or GetFederationToken. 
Amazon WorkDocs supports using temporary credentials. 
Service-linked roles
Service-linked roles allow AWS services to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.
Amazon WorkDocs does not support service-linked roles.
Service roles
This feature allows a service to assume a service role on your behalf. This role allows the service to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Service roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the account. This means that an IAM administrator can change the permissions for this role. However, doing so might break the functionality of the service.
Amazon WorkDocs does not support service roles.
