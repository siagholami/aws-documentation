Creating a Role
When you aggregate log files from multiple accounts into a single Amazon S3 bucket, only the account that has full control of the bucket, Account A in our example, has full read access to all of the log files in the bucket. Accounts B, C, and Z in our example do not have any rights until granted. Therefore, to share your AWS CloudTrail log files from one account to another (that is, to complete either Scenario 1 or Scenario 2 described previously in this section), you must enable cross-account access. You can do this by creating IAM roles and their associated access policies. 
Roles
Create an IAM role for each account to which you want to give access. In our example, you will have three roles, one each for accounts B, C, and Z. Each IAM role defines an access or permissions policy that enables the accounts to access the resources (log files) owned by account A. The permissions are attached to each role and are associated with each account (B, C, or Z) only when the role is assumed. For details about permissions management for IAM roles, see IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide. For more information about how to assume a role, see Assuming a Role. 
Policies
There are two policies for each IAM role you create. The trust policy specifies a * trusted entity or principal*. In our example, accounts B, C, and Z are trusted entities, and an IAM user with the proper permissions in those accounts can assume the role. 
The trust policy is automatically created when you use the console to create the role. If you use the SDK to create the role, you must supply the trust policy as a parameter to the CreateRole API. If you use the CLI to create the role, you must specify the trust policy in the create-role CLI command. 
The role access (or permissions) policy that you must create as the owner of Account A defines what actions and resources the principal or trusted entity is allowed access to (in this case, the CloudTrail log files). For Scenario 1 that grants log file access to the account that generated the log files, as discussed in Creating an Access Policy to Grant Access to Accounts You Own. For Scenario 2 that grants read access to all log files to a third party, as discussed in Creating an Access Policy to Grant Access to a Third Party . 
For further details about creating and working with IAM policies, see Access Management in the IAM User Guide.
Creating a Role
To Create a Role by Using the Console


Sign into the AWS Management Console as an administrator of Account A.


Navigate to the IAM console.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles.


Choose Create New Role.


Type a name for the new role, and then choose Next Step.


Choose Role for Cross-Account Access.


For Scenario 1, do the following to provide access between accounts you own:


Choose Provide access between AWS accounts you own.


Enter the twelve-digit account ID of the account (B, C, or Z) to be granted access.


Check the Require MFA box if you want the user to provide multi-factor authentication before assuming the role. 


For Scenario 2, do the following to provide access to a third-party account. In our example, you would perform these steps for Account Z, the third-party log analyzer:


Choose Allows IAM users from a 3rd party AWS account to access this account.


Enter the twelve-digit account ID of the account (Account Z) to be granted access.


Enter an external ID that provides additional control over who can assume the role. For more information, see How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party in the IAM User Guide. 


Choose Next Step to attach a policy that sets the permissions for this role.


Under Attach Policy, choose the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess policy.
Note
By default, the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess policy grants retrieval and list rights to all Amazon S3 buckets within your account.
    To grant an account access to only that account's log files (Scenario 1), see Creating an Access Policy to Grant Access to Accounts You Own.
     To grant an account access to all of the log files in the Amazon S3 bucket (Scenario 2), see Creating an Access Policy to Grant Access to a Third Party .


Choose Next Step


Review the role information. 
Note
You can edit the role name at this point if you wish, but if you do so, you will be taken back to the Step 2: Select Role Type page where you must reenter the information for the role. 


Choose Create Role. When the role creation process completes, the role you created appears in the role list.
