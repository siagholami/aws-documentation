Getting and Viewing Your CloudTrail Log Files
After you create a trail and configure it to capture the log files you want, you need to be able to find the log files and interpret the information they contain.
CloudTrail delivers your log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify when you create the trail. Typically, log files appear in your bucket within 15 minutes of the recorded AWS API call or other AWS event. Insights events are typically delivered to your bucket within 30 minutes of unusual activity. After you enable Insights events for the first time, allow up to 36 hours to see the first Insights events, if unusual activity is detected.
