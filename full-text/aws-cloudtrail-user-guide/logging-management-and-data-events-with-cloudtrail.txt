Logging Data and Management Events for Trails
When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates whether the event matches the settings for your trails. Only events that match your trail settings are delivered to your Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.
You can configure your trails to log the following:
 Data events: These events provide insight into the resource operations performed on or within a resource. These are also known as data plane operations. 
 Management events: Management events provide insight into management operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account. These are also known as control plane operations. Management events can also include non-API events that occur in your account. For example, when a user logs in to your account, CloudTrail logs the ConsoleLogin event. For more information, see Non-API Events Captured by CloudTrail. 
Note
Not all AWS services support CloudTrail management events or data events. For more information about supported services, see CloudTrail Supported Services and Integrations. For specific details about what APIs are logged for a specific service, see that service's documentation in CloudTrail Supported Services and Integrations.
You can configure multiple trails differently so that the trails process and log only the events that you specify. For example, one trail can log read-only data and management events, so that all read-only events are delivered to one S3 bucket. Another trail can log only write-only data and management events, so that all write-only events are delivered to a separate S3 bucket. 
You can also configure your trails to have one trail log and deliver all management events to one S3 bucket, and configure another trail to log and deliver all data events to another S3 bucket. 
By default, trails log all management events and don't include data events. Additional charges apply for data events. For more information, see  AWS CloudTrail Pricing.
Note
The events that are logged by your trails are available in Amazon CloudWatch Events. For example, if you configure a trail to log data events for S3 objects but not management events, your trail processes and logs only data events for the specified S3 objects. The data events for these S3 objects are available in Amazon CloudWatch Events. For more information, see AWS API Call Events in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide.

Data Events
Data events provide insight into the resource operations performed on or within a resource. These are also known as data plane operations. Data events are often high-volume activities. 
Example data events include:
  Amazon S3 object-level API activity (for example, GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject API operations)
 AWS Lambda function execution activity (the Invoke API)
Data events are disabled by default when you create a trail. To record CloudTrail data events, you must explicitly add the supported resources or resource types for which you want to collect activity to a trail. For more information, see Creating a Trail and Data Events.
Additional charges apply for logging data events. For CloudTrail pricing, see AWS CloudTrail Pricing.
Logging Data Events with the AWS Management Console


Navigate to the Trails page of the CloudTrail console and choose Create trail. 
Note
While you can edit an existing trail to add logging data events, as a best practice, consider creating a separate trail specifically for logging data events.


For Data events, choose the pencil icon to enable editing. 


For Amazon S3 data events, on the S3 tab:


To configure data event logging for all Amazon S3 buckets in your AWS account, select Select all S3 buckets in your account. Then choose whether you want to log Read events, such as GetObject; Write events, such as PutObject; or both types of events. This setting takes precedence over any settings you configure for individual buckets. For example, if you specify logging Read events for all S3 buckets, and then choose to add a specific bucket for data event logging, Read will already be selected for that bucket. You cannot clear the selection. You can only configure the option for Write. 
Note
If you select or clear an option for all buckets, that change is applied to all buckets you might have individually configured for data event logging. Consider reviewing the data event settings for individual buckets after you change the data event settings for all buckets. 
If you configure data event logging for all buckets in your AWS account, and you do not want an audit trail of data event logging, consider delivering your log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that belongs to another AWS account. For more information, see Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Accounts and Examples: Logging Data Events for Amazon S3 Objects.


To configure data event logging for individual Amazon S3 buckets, choose Add S3 bucket. Type the bucket name and prefix (optional). For each trail, you can add up to 250 data resources, such as Amazon S3 bucket and object prefixes. The overall total of individual data event resources cannot exceed 250 in a single trail. That total includes other data resources, such as Lambda functions. This restriction does not apply if you configure data event logging for all Amazon S3 buckets.

To log data events for all S3 objects in a bucket, specify an S3 bucket and an empty prefix. When an event occurs on an object in that S3 bucket, the trail processes and logs the event. For more information, see Example: Logging data events for all S3 objects.
To log data events for S3 prefixes, specify an S3 bucket and the object prefix. When an event occurs on an object in that S3 bucket and the object starts with the specified prefix, the trail processes and logs the event. For more information, see Example: Logging data events for specific S3 objects. 
You can also specify S3 objects that belong to other AWS accounts. For more information, see Logging Data Events for S3 Objects in Other AWS Accounts.



For each resource, specify whether you want to log Read, Write, or both types of events.


You can edit the bucket name, prefix, Read/Write option, or remove the resource by choosing the x icon.
Note
If you configured data event logging for all S3 buckets in your AWS account, the settings you configured take precedence over individual bucket settings. In this case, you cannot edit an option that is set for all buckets.


For Lambda data events, on the Lambda tab:


To configure data event logging for individual Lambda functions, select them from the list. If the trail applies to all AWS Regions, you can select from functions in all regions in your AWS account. If the trail applies to only one region, you can only select from functions in that region. For each trail, you can add up to 250 data resources, such as individual Lambda functions. The total of individual data event resources cannot exceed 250 in a single trail. That total includes other data resources, such as Amazon S3 bucket and object prefixes. This restriction does not apply if you configure data event logging for all Lambda functions.
Note
If you have more than 15,000 Lambda functions in your account, you cannot view or select all functions in the CloudTrail console. You can still select the option to log all Lambda functions. You can also manually add a function if you know its ARN, or you can use the AWS CLI and the put-event-selectors command to configure specific data event logging for resources. For more information, see Managing Trails With the AWS CLI.


To configure data event logging for all Lambda functions in your AWS account, and any Lambda function you might create in the future, select Log all current and future functions. If the trail applies to all regions, this will log all functions in all regions in your AWS account, including any you might create in any region. If the trail applies to a single region, this will log all functions in the current region and any you might create in that region, but will not enable logging of functions in other regions. Logging data events for all functions will also enable logging of data event activity performed by any user or role in your AWS account, even if that activity is performed on a function that belongs to another AWS account.


Choose Save.


Examples: Logging Data Events for Amazon S3 Objects
Logging data events for all S3 objects in an S3 bucket
The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named bucket-1. In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and the option to log both Read and Write data events. 


A user uploads an object to bucket-1. 


The PutObject API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur on any object in that bucket are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.


Another user uploads an object to bucket-2. 


The PutObject API operation occurred on an object in an S3 bucket that wasn't specified for the trail. The trail doesn't log the event. 


Logging data events for specific S3 objects
The following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure a trail to log events for specific S3 objects. In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an S3 bucket named bucket-3, with the prefix my-images, and the option to log only Write data events.


A user deletes an object that begins with the my-images prefix in the bucket, such as arn:aws:s3:::bucket-3/my-images/example.jpg.


The DeleteObject API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level API. It is recorded as a Write data event in CloudTrail. The event occurred on an object that matches the S3 bucket and prefix specified in the trail. The trail processes and logs the event.


Another user deletes an object with a different prefix in the S3 bucket, such as arn:aws:s3:::bucket-3/my-videos/example.avi.


The event occurred on an object that doesn't match the prefix specified in your trail. The trail doesn't log the event.


A user calls the GetObject API operation for the object, arn:aws:s3:::bucket-3/my-images/example.jpg.


The event occurred on a bucket and prefix that are specified in the trail, but GetObject is a read-type Amazon S3 object-level API. It is recorded as a Read data event in CloudTrail, and the trail is not configured to log Read events. The trail doesn't log the event.


Note
If you are logging data events for specific Amazon S3 buckets, we recommend you do not use an Amazon S3 bucket for which you are logging data events to receive log files that you have specified in the data events section. Using the same Amazon S3 bucket causes your trail to log a data event each time log files are delivered to your Amazon S3 bucket. Log files are aggregated events delivered at intervals, so this is not a 1:1 ratio of event to log file; the event is logged in the next log file. For example, when the trail delivers logs, the PutObject event occurs on the S3 bucket. If the S3 bucket is also specified in the data events section, the trail processes and logs the PutObject event as a data event. That action is another PutObject event, and the trail processes and logs the event again. For more information, see How CloudTrail Works.
To avoid logging data events for the Amazon S3 bucket where you receive log files if you configure a trail to log all Amazon S3 data events in your AWS account, consider configuring delivery of log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that belongs to another AWS account. For more information, see Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Accounts.
Logging Data Events for S3 Objects in Other AWS Accounts
When you configure your trail to log data events, you can also specify S3 objects that belong to other AWS accounts. When an event occurs on a specified object, CloudTrail evaluates whether the event matches any trails in each account. If the event matches the settings for a trail, the trail processes and logs the event for that account. 
If you own an S3 object and you specify it in your trail, your trail logs events that occur on the object in your account. Because you own the object, your trail also logs events when other accounts call the object.
If you specify an S3 object in your trail, and another account owns the object, your trail only logs events that occur on that object in your account. Your trail doesn't log events that occur in other accounts.
Example: Logging data events for an S3 object for two AWS accounts
The following example shows how two AWS accounts configure CloudTrail to log events for the same S3 object.


In your account, you want your trail to log data events for all objects in your S3 bucket named owner-bucket. You configure the trail by specifying the S3 bucket with an empty object prefix.


Bob has a separate account that has been granted access to the S3 bucket. Bob also wants to log data events for all objects in the same S3 bucket. For his trail, he configures his trail and specifies the same S3 bucket with an empty object prefix.


Bob uploads an object to the S3 bucket with the PutObject API operation. 


This event occurred in his account and it matches the settings for his trail. Bob's trail processes and logs the event.


Because you own the S3 bucket and the event matches the settings for your trail, your trail also processes and logs the same event.


You upload an object to the S3 bucket. 


This event occurs in your account and it matches the settings for your trail. Your trail processes and logs the event.


Because the event didn't occur in Bob's account, and he doesn't own the S3 bucket, Bob's trail doesn't log the event.


Management Events
Management events provide insight into management operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account. These are also known as control plane operations. Example management events include:
 Configuring security (for example, IAM AttachRolePolicy API operations)
 Registering devices (for example, Amazon EC2 CreateDefaultVpc API operations)
 Configuring rules for routing data (for example, Amazon EC2 CreateSubnet API operations)
 Setting up logging (for example, AWS CloudTrail CreateTrail API operations)
Management events can also include non-API events that occur in your account. For example, when a user logs in to your account, CloudTrail logs the ConsoleLogin event. For more information, see Non-API Events Captured by CloudTrail. For a list of supported management events that CloudTrail logs for AWS services, see CloudTrail Supported Services and Integrations.
By default, trails are configured to log management events. For a list of supported management events that CloudTrail logs for AWS services, see CloudTrail Supported Services and Integrations.
Note
The CloudTrail Event history feature supports only management events. Not all management events are supported in event history. For more information, see Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History. 
Logging Management Events with the AWS Management Console


Navigate to the Trails page of the CloudTrail console and choose the trail.


For Management events, click the pencil icon.


For Read/Write events, choose if you want your trail to log All, Read-only, Write-only, or None, and then choose Save.


Read-only and Write-only Events
When you configure your trail to log data and management events, you can specify whether you want read-only events, write-only events, both, or none.
 Read-only
Read-only events include API operations that read your resources, but don't make changes. For example, read-only events include the Amazon EC2 DescribeSecurityGroups and DescribeSubnets API operations. These operations return only information about your Amazon EC2 resources and don't change your configurations. 
 Write-only
Write-only events include API operations that modify (or might modify) your resources. For example, the Amazon EC2 RunInstances and TerminateInstances API operations modify your instances.
 All
Your trail logs both.
 None
Your trail logs neither read-only nor write-only management events.
Example: Logging read-only and write-only events for separate trails
The following example shows how you can configure trails to split log activity for an account into separate S3 buckets: one bucket receives read-only events and a second bucket receives write-only events. 


You create a trail and choose an S3 bucket named read-only-bucket to receive log files. You then update the trail to specify that you want read-only management events and data events. 


You create a second trail and choose an S3 bucket named write-only-bucket to receive log files. You then update the trail to specify that you want write-only management events and data events.


The Amazon EC2 DescribeInstances and TerminateInstances API operations occur in your account.


The DescribeInstances API operation is a read-only event and it matches the settings for the first trail. The trail logs and delivers the event to the read-only-bucket.


The TerminateInstances API operation is a write-only event and it matches the settings for the second trail. The trail logs and delivers the event to the write-only-bucket.


Logging Events with the AWS Command Line Interface
You can configure your trails to log management and data events using the AWS CLI.
To view whether your trail is logging management and data events, run the get-event-selectors command. 
aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name TrailName
The following example returns the default settings for a trail. By default, trails log all management events and don't log data events.
{
    "EventSelectors": [
        {
            "IncludeManagementEvents": true,
            "DataResources": [],
            "ReadWriteType": "All"
        }
    ],
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/TrailName"
}
To configure your trail to log management and data events, run the put-event-selectors command. The following example shows how to configure your trail to include all management and data events for two S3 objects. You can specify from 1 to 5 event selectors for a trail. You can specify from 1 to 250 data resources for a trail. 
Note
The maximum number of S3 data resources is 250, regardless of the number of event selectors. 
aws cloudtrail put-event-selectors --trail-name TrailName --event-selectors '[{ "ReadWriteType": "All", "IncludeManagementEvents":true, "DataResources": [{ "Type": "AWS::S3::Object", "Values": ["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/prefix", "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket2/prefix2"] }] }]'
The following example returns the event selector configured for the trail.
{
    "EventSelectors": [
        {
            "IncludeManagementEvents": true,
            "DataResources": [
                {
                    "Values": [
                        "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/prefix",
                        "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket2/prefix2",
                    ],
                    "Type": "AWS::S3::Object"
                }
            ],
            "ReadWriteType": "All"
        }
    ],
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/TrailName"
}
Logging Events with the AWS SDKs
Use the GetEventSelectors operation to see whether your trail is logging management and data events for a trail. You can configure your trails to log management and data events with the PutEventSelectors operation. For more information, see the AWS CloudTrail API Reference.
Sending Events to Amazon CloudWatch Logs
CloudTrail supports sending data and management events to CloudWatch Logs. When you configure your trail to send events to your CloudWatch Logs log group, CloudTrail sends only the events that you specify in your trail. For example, if you configure your trail to log data events only, your trail delivers data events only to your CloudWatch Logs log group. For more information, see Monitoring CloudTrail Log Files with Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
