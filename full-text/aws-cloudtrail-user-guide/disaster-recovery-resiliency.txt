Resilience in AWS CloudTrail
The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures. If you specifically need to replicate your CloudTrail log files over greater geographic distances, you can use Cross-Region Replication for your trail Amazon S3 buckets, which enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different AWS Regions.
For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see AWS Global Infrastructure.
In addition to the AWS global infrastructure, CloudTrail offers several features to help support your data resiliency and backup needs.
Trails that log events in all AWS Regions
When you apply a trail to all AWS Regions, CloudTrail creates trails with identical configurations in all other AWS Regions in your account. When AWS adds a new Region, that trail configuration is automatically created in the new Region.
Versioning, lifecycle configuration, and object lock protection for CloudTrail log data
Because CloudTrail uses Amazon S3 buckets to store log files, you can also use the features provided by Amazon S3 to help support your data resiliency and backup needs. For more information, see Resilience in Amazon S3.
