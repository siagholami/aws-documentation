Logging Insights Events for Trails
AWS CloudTrail Insights helps AWS users identify and respond to unusual activity associated with write API calls by continuously analyzing CloudTrail management events.
Insights events are logged when CloudTrail detects unusual write management API activity in your account. If you have CloudTrail Insights enabled, and CloudTrail detects unusual activity, Insights events are delivered to the destination S3 bucket for your trail. You can also see the type of insight and the incident time period when you view Insights events on the CloudTrail console. Unlike other types of events captured in a CloudTrail trail, Insights events are logged only when CloudTrail detects changes in your account's API usage that differ significantly from the account's typical usage patterns.
CloudTrail Insights continuously monitors CloudTrail write management events, and uses mathematical models to determine the normal levels of API and service event activity for an account. CloudTrail Insights identifies behavior that is outside normal patterns, generates Insights events, and delivers those events to a /CloudTrail-Insight folder in the chosen destination S3 bucket for your trail. You can also access and view Insights events in the AWS Management Console for CloudTrail. For more information about how to access and view Insights events in the console and by using the AWS CLI, see Viewing CloudTrail Insights Events in this guide.
By default, trails log all management events and don't include data events or Insights events. Additional charges apply for data and Insights events. For more information, see  AWS CloudTrail Pricing.
When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates whether the event matches the settings for your trails. Only events that match your trail settings are delivered to your Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.

Understanding Insights
CloudTrail Insights can help you detect unusual API activity in your AWS account by raising Insights events. CloudTrail Insights tracks your normal patterns of API call volume and generates Insights events when the volume is outside normal patterns. Insights events are generated for write management APIs.
After you enable CloudTrail Insights for the first time on a trail, it can take up to 36 hours for CloudTrail to deliver the first Insights event, if unusual activity is detected. CloudTrail Insights analyzes write management events that occur in a single Region, not globally. A CloudTrail Insights event is generated in the same Region as its supporting management events are generated.
The following image shows an example of Insights events. You open details pages for an Insights event by choosing an Insights event name from the Dashboard or Insights pages. The details page for an Insights event shows a graph of an API's call volume that occurred over a period of time before and after one or more Insights events are logged. In the graph, Insights events are highlighted with vertical bars, with the width of the bar showing the start and end time of the Insights event.
In this example, a vertical highlighting band shows unusual numbers of AWS Systems Manager UpdateInstanceInformation API calls in an account. In the highlighted area, because the number of UpdateInstanceInformation calls rose above the account's normal range of 100.4 calls per minute, CloudTrail logged an Insights event when it detected the unusual activity. The Insights event recorded that as many as 875 UpdateInstanceInformation calls were made at about 1:37 p.m. This is about 775 more calls to that API per minute than is expected for the account. In this example, the graph's time span is one hour: 1:10 p.m. PDT on November 1, 2019 to 2:10 p.m. PDT on November 1, 2019. This event has a start time of 1:37 p.m. PDT on November 1, 2019, and an end time of 1:38 p.m. PDT.
The left column lists Insights events that are related to the subject API, and that have the same Insights event type.

On the CloudTrail events tab, view related events that CloudTrail analyzed to determine that unusual activity occurred. Note that a filter is already applied for the Insights event name, which is also the name of the related API. The CloudTrail events tab shows CloudTrail management events related to the subject API that occurred between the start and end time of the Insights event. These events help you perform deeper analysis to determine the probable cause of an Insights event, and reasons for unusual API activity.
If you disable CloudTrail Insights on a trail, or stop logging on a trail (which disables CloudTrail Insights), you may have Insights events stored in your destination S3 bucket, or shown on the Insights page of the console, that date from the earlier time that you had Insights enabled.
Logging Insights Events with the AWS Management Console
Enable Insights event collection on an existing trail. By default, Insights event collection is not enabled.


Navigate to the Trails page of the CloudTrail console and choose a trail.


In Insights events, choose the pencil icon.


For Log Insights events, choose Yes. Choose Save to save your changes.


It can take up to 36 hours for CloudTrail to deliver the first Insights events, if unusual activity is detected.
Logging Insights Events with the AWS Command Line Interface
You can configure your trails to log Insights events using the AWS CLI.
To view whether your trail is logging Insights events, run the get-insight-selectors command.
aws cloudtrail get-insight-selectors --trail-name TrailName
The following result shows the default settings for a trail. By default, trails don't log Insights events. The InsightType attribute value is empty, and no Insight event selectors are specified, because Insights event collection is not enabled.
{
  "InsightSelectors": 
    [
      { 
        "InsightType": "" 
      }
    ], 
  "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:trail/TrailName"
}
To configure your trail to log Insights events, run the put-insight-selectors command. The following example shows how to configure your trail to include Insights events. In this release, the only Insights selector is ApiCallRateInsight.
aws cloudtrail put-insight-selectors --trail-name TrailName --insight-selectors '[{"InsightType": "ApiCallRateInsight"}]'
The following result shows the Insights event selector that is configured for the trail.
{
  "InsightSelectors": 
    [
      {
        "InsightType": "ApiCallRateInsight"
      }
    ],
  "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:trail/TrailName"
}
Logging Events with the AWS SDKs
Run the GetInsightSelectors operation to see whether your trail is logging Insights events for a trail. You can configure your trails to log Insights events with the PutInsightSelectors operation. For more information, see the AWS CloudTrail API Reference.
Sending Events to Amazon CloudWatch Logs
CloudTrail supports sending Insights events to CloudWatch Logs. When you configure your trail to send Insights events to your CloudWatch Logs log group, CloudTrail Insights sends only the events that you specify in your trail. For example, if you configure your trail to log management and Insights events, your trail delivers management and Insights events to your CloudWatch Logs log group. To configure CloudWatch Events with the CloudWatch console or API, choose the AWS Insight via CloudTrail event type on the Create rule page in the CloudWatch console. For more information, see Monitoring CloudTrail Log Files with Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
