Downloading Your CloudTrail Log Files
Log files are in JSON format. If you have a JSON viewer add-on installed, you can view the files directly in your browser. Double-click the log file name in the bucket to open a new browser window or tab. The JSON displays in a readable format. 
For example, if you use Mozilla Firefox, you can also download the JSONView add-on. With JSONView, you can double-click the compressed .gz file in your bucket to open the log file in JSON format. 
CloudTrail log files are Amazon S3 objects. You can use the Amazon S3 console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the Amazon S3 API to retrieve log files. 
For more information, see Working with Amazon S3 Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
