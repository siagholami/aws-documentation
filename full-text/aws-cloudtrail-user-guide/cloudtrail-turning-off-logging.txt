Turning off Logging for a Trail
When you create a trail, logging is turned on automatically. You can turn off logging for a trail. Previous logs will still be accessible.
To turn off logging for a trail with the CloudTrail console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/.


In the navigation pane, choose Trails, and then choose the trail that you want to configure. 


At the top of the configuration page, choose Logging to turn off logging for the trail.


When the stop logging message appears, choose Continue. CloudTrail stops logging activity for that trail.


To resume logging for that trail, choose Logging again.
