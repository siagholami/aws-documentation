AWS Encryption SDK for C
The AWS Encryption SDK for C provides a client-side encryption library for developers who are writing applications in C. It also serves as a foundation for implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK in higher-level programming languages.
Like all implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK, the AWS Encryption SDK for C offers advanced data protection features. These include envelope encryption, additional authenticated data (AAD), and secure, authenticated, symmetric key algorithm suites, such as 256-bit AES-GCM with key derivation and signing.
All language-specific implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK are fully interoperable. For example, you can encrypt data with the AWS Encryption SDK for C and decrypt it with any supported language implementation, including the AWS Encryption CLI.
The AWS Encryption SDK for C uses the AWS SDK for C to interact with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) so it can support the optional AWS KMS keyring. However, the AWS Encryption SDK doesn't require AWS KMS or any other AWS service.
