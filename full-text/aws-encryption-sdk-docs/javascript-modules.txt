Modules in the AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript
The modules in the AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript make it easy to install the code that you need for your projects.
Modules for JavaScript Node.js
client-node
Includes all of the modules you need to program with the AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript in Node.js.
caching-materials-manager-node
Exports functions that support the data key caching feature in the AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript in Node.js. 
decrypt-node
Exports functions that decrypt and verify encrypted messages representing data and data streams. Included in the client-node module.
encrypt-node
Exports functions that encrypt and sign different types of data. Included in the client-node module.
example-node
Exports working examples of programming with the AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript in Node.js. Includes example of different types of keyrings and different types of data.
hkdf-node
Exports an HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF) that the AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript in Node.js uses in particular algorithm suites. The AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript in the browser uses the native HKDF function in the WebCrypto API.
integration-node
Defines tests that verify that the AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is compatible with other language implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK.
kms-keyring-node
Exports functions that support AWS KMS keyrings in Node.js.
raw-aes-keyring-node
Exports functions that support Raw AES keyrings in Node.js.
raw-rsa-keyring-node
Exports functions that support Raw RSA keyrings in Node.js.
