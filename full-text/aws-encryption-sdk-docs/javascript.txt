AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript
The AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript is designed to provide a client-side encryption library for developers who are writing web browser applications in JavaScript or web server applications in Node.js.
Like all implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK, the AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript offers advanced data protection features. These include envelope encryption, additional authenticated data (AAD), and secure, authenticated, symmetric key algorithm suites, such as 256-bit AES-GCM with key derivation and signing.
All language-specific implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK are designed to be interoperable, subject to the constraints of the language. For details about language constraints for JavaScript, see Compatibility of the AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript.
