AWS CDK Developer Guide history
See Releases for information about AWS CDK releases. The AWS CDK is updated approximately once a week. Maintenance versions may be released between weekly releases to address critical issues. Each release includes a matched AWS CDK Toolkit (CDK CLI), AWS Construct Library, and API Reference. Updates to this Guide generally do not synchronize with AWS CDK releases.
