What is the AWS CDK?
Welcome to the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) Developer Guide. This document provides information about the AWS CDK, which is a software development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation.
AWS CloudFormation enables you to:
 Create and provision AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly.
 Leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon SNS, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling.
 Build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud without worrying about creating and configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.
 Use a template file to create and delete a collection of resources together as a single unit (a stack).
Use the AWS CDK to define your cloud resources in a familiar programming language. The AWS CDK supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C#/.Net.
Developers can use one of the supported programming languages to define reusable cloud components known as Constructs. You compose these together into Stacks and Apps.

Why use the AWS CDK?
Let's look at the power of the AWS CDK. Here is some code in an AWS CDK project to create an Amazon ECS service with AWS Fargate launch type (this is the code we use in the Creating an AWS Fargate service using the AWS CDK).

[ TypeScript ]
```
export class MyEcsConstructStack extends core.Stack {
  constructor(scope: core.App, id: string, props?: core.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, "MyVpc", {
  maxAzs: 3 // Default is all AZs in region
});

const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, "MyCluster", {
  vpc: vpc
});

// Create a load-balanced Fargate service and make it public
new ecs_patterns.ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService(this, "MyFargateService", {
  cluster: cluster, // Required
  cpu: 512, // Default is 256
  desiredCount: 6, // Default is 1
  taskImageOptions: { image: ecs.ContainerImage.fromRegistry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample") },
  memoryLimitMiB: 2048, // Default is 512
  publicLoadBalancer: true // Default is false
});

}
}
```

[ JavaScript ]
```
class MyEcsConstructStack extends core.Stack {
  constructor(scope, id, props) {
    super(scope, id, props);
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, "MyVpc", {
  maxAzs: 3 // Default is all AZs in region
});

const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, "MyCluster", {
  vpc: vpc
});

// Create a load-balanced Fargate service and make it public
new ecs_patterns.ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService(this, "MyFargateService", {
  cluster: cluster, // Required
  cpu: 512, // Default is 256
  desiredCount: 6, // Default is 1
  taskImageOptions: { image: ecs.ContainerImage.fromRegistry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample") },
  memoryLimitMiB: 2048, // Default is 512
  publicLoadBalancer: true // Default is false
});

}
}
module.exports = { MyEcsConstructStack }
```

[ Python ]
```
class MyEcsConstructStack(core.Stack):
def __init__(self, scope: core.Construct, id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
    super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)

    vpc = ec2.Vpc(self, "MyVpc", max_azs=3)     # default is all AZs in region

    cluster = ecs.Cluster(self, "MyCluster", vpc=vpc)

    ecs_patterns.ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService(self, "MyFargateService",
        cluster=cluster,            # Required
        cpu=512,                    # Default is 256
        desired_count=6,            # Default is 1
        task_image_options=ecs_patterns.ApplicationLoadBalancedTaskImageOptions(
            image=ecs.ContainerImage.from_registry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample")),
        memory_limit_mib=2048,      # Default is 512
        public_load_balancer=True)  # Default is False

```

[ Java ]
```
public class MyEcsConstructStack extends Stack {
public MyEcsConstructStack(final Construct scope, final String id) {
    this(scope, id, null);
}

public MyEcsConstructStack(final Construct scope, final String id,
        StackProps props) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    Vpc vpc = Vpc.Builder.create(this, "MyVpc").maxAzs(3).build();

    Cluster cluster = Cluster.Builder.create(this, "MyCluster")
            .vpc(vpc).build();

    ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService.Builder.create(this, "MyFargateService")
            .cluster(cluster)
            .cpu(512)
            .desiredCount(6)
            .taskImageOptions(
                   ApplicationLoadBalancedTaskImageOptions.builder()
                           .image(ContainerImage
                                   .fromRegistry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample"))
                           .build()).memoryLimitMiB(2048)
            .publicLoadBalancer(true).build();
}

}
```

[ C# ]
```
using Amazon.CDK;
using Amazon.CDK.AWS.EC2;
using Amazon.CDK.AWS.ECS;
using Amazon.CDK.AWS.ECS.Patterns;
public class MyEcsConstructStack : Stack
{
    public MyEcsConstructStack(Construct scope, string id, IStackProps props=null) : base(scope, id, props)
    {
        var vpc = new Vpc(this, "MyVpc", new VpcProps
        {
            MaxAzs = 3
        });
    var cluster = new Cluster(this, "MyCluster", new ClusterProps
    {
        Vpc = vpc
    });

    new ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService(this, "MyFargateService", 
        new ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateServiceProps
    {
        Cluster = cluster,
        Cpu = 512,
        DesiredCount = 6,
        TaskImageOptions = new ApplicationLoadBalancedTaskImageOptions
        {
            Image = ContainerImage.FromRegistry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample")
        },
        MemoryLimitMiB = 2048,
        PublicLoadBalancer = true,
    });
}

}
```

  AWS::EC2::Route 
  AWS::EC2::RouteTable 
  AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup

  AWS::EC2::VPC 
  AWS::ECS::Cluster 
  AWS::ECS::Service 
  AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition 
  AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::Listener 
  AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer 
  AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::TargetGroup 
  AWS::IAM::Policy

  AWS::Logs::LogGroup 
Other advantages of the AWS CDK include:
 Use logic (if statements, for-loops, etc) when defining your infrastructure
 Use object-oriented techniques to create a model of your system
 Define high level abstractions, share them, and publish them to your team, company, or community
 Organize your project into logical modules
 Share and reuse your infrastructure as a library
 Testing your infrastructure code using industry-standard protocols
 Use your existing code review workflow
 Code completion within your IDE

Developing with the AWS CDK
Code snippets and longer examples are available in the AWS CDK's supported programming languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C#. See AWS CDK examples for a list of the examples.
The AWS CDK Toolkit is a command line tool for interacting with CDK apps. It enables developers to synthesize artifacts such as AWS CloudFormation templates, deploy stacks to development AWS accounts, and diff against a deployed stack to understand the impact of a code change.
The AWS Construct Library includes a module for each AWS service with constructs that offer rich APIs that encapsulate the details of how to create resources for an Amazon or AWS service. The aim of the AWS Construct Library is to reduce the complexity and glue logic required when integrating various AWS services to achieve your goals on AWS.
Note
There is no charge for using the AWS CDK, but you might incur AWS charges for creating or using AWS chargeable resources, such as running Amazon EC2 instances or using Amazon S3 storage. Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate charges for the use of various AWS resources.
Contributing to the AWS CDK
Because the AWS CDK is open source, the team encourages you to contribute to make it an even better tool. For details, see Contributing.

About Amazon Web Services
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of digital infrastructure services that developers can use when developing their applications. The services include computing, storage, database, and application synchronization (messaging and queueing).
AWS uses a pay-as-you-go service model. You are charged only for the services that you — or your applications — use. Also, to make AWS useful as a platform for prototyping and experimentation, AWS offers a free usage tier, in which services are free below a certain level of usage. For more information about AWS costs and the free usage tier, see Test-Driving AWS in the Free Usage Tier.
