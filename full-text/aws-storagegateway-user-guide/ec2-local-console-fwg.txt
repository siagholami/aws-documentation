Logging In to Your Amazon EC2 Gateway Local Console
You can connect to your Amazon EC2 instance by using a Secure Shell (SSH) client. For detailed information, see Connect to Your Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. To connect this way, you need the SSH key pair that you specified when you launched your instance. For information about Amazon EC2 key pairs, see Amazon EC2 Key Pairs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

Log in to your local console. If you are connecting to your EC2 instance from a Windows computer, log in as admin.


After you log in, you see the AWS Appliance Activation - Configuration main menu, as shown in the following screenshot.
 
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


To shut down the gateway, enter 0. 
To exit the configuration session, enter x to exit the menu. 
Routing Your Gateway Deployed on EC2 Through an HTTP Proxy
AWS Storage Gateway supports the configuration of a Socket Secure version 5 (SOCKS5) proxy between your gateway deployed on Amazon EC2 and AWS.
If your gateway must use a proxy server to communicate to the internet, then you need to configure the HTTP proxy settings for your gateway. You do this by specifying an IP address and port number for the host running your proxy. After you do so, AWS Storage Gateway routes all HTTPS traffic through your proxy server. 
To route your gateway internet traffic through a local proxy server


Log in to your gateway's local console. For instructions, see Logging In to Your Amazon EC2 Gateway Local Console.


On the AWS Appliance Activation - Configuration main menu, enter 1 to begin configuring the HTTP proxy.



Choose one of the following options in the *AWS Appliance Activation - Configuration* HTTP Proxy Configuration menu.

Viewing Your Gateway System Resource Status
When your gateway starts, it checks its virtual CPU cores, root volume size, and RAM. It then determines whether these system resources are sufficient for your gateway to function properly. You can view the results of this check on the gateway's local console.
To view the status of a system resource check


Log in to your gateway's local console. For instructions, see Logging In to Your Amazon EC2 Gateway Local Console.
