Performing Tasks on the VM Local Console (File Gateway)
For a file gateway deployed on-premises, you can perform the following maintenance tasks using the VM host's local console. These tasks are common to VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisors.
Topics
 Logging In to the File Gateway Local Console
 Configuring an HTTP Proxy
 Configuring Your Gateway Network Settings
 Testing Your Gateway Connection to the Internet
 Viewing Your Gateway System Resource Status
 Configuring a Network Time Protocol (NTP) Server for Your Gateway
 Running Storage Gateway Commands on the Local Console
 Configuring Network Adapters for Your Gateway
Logging In to the File Gateway Local Console
When the VM is ready for you to log in, the login screen is displayed. If this is your first time logging in to the local console, you use the default user name and password to log in. These default login credentials give you access to menus where you can configure gateway network settings and change the password from the local console. AWS Storage Gateway enables you to set your own password from the Storage Gateway console instead of changing the password from the local console. You don't need to know the default password to set a new password. For more information, see Setting the Local Console Password from the Storage Gateway Console.

To log in to the gateway's local console
 If this is your first time logging in to the local console, log in to the VM with the default credentials. The default user name is admin and the password is password. Otherwise, use your credentials to log in.
Note
We recommend changing the default password. You do this by running the passwd command from the local console menu (item 6 on the main menu). For information about how to run the command, see Running Storage Gateway Commands on the Local Console. You can also set the password from the Storage Gateway console. For more information, see Setting the Local Console Password from the Storage Gateway Console.
Setting the Local Console Password from the Storage Gateway Console
When you log in to the local console for the first time, you log in to the VM with the default credentials. For all types of gateways, you use default credentials. The user name is admin and the password is password.
We recommend that you always set a new password immediately after you create your new gateway. You can set this password from the AWS Storage Gateway console rather than the local console if you want. You don't need to know the default password to set a new password.
To set the local console password on the Storage Gateway console


Open the AWS Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home.


On the navigation pane, choose Gateways, and then choose the gateway for which you want to set a new password.


For Actions, choose Set Local Console Password.


In the Set Local Console Password dialog box, enter a new password, confirm the password, and then choose Save. 


Your new password replaces the default password. AWS Storage Gateway doesn't save the password but rather safely transmits it to the VM.
Note
The password can consist of any character on the keyboard and can be 1â€“512 characters long.
Configuring an HTTP Proxy
File gateways support configuration of an HTTP proxy. 
Note
The only proxy configuration that file gateways support is HTTP.
If your gateway must use a proxy server to communicate to the internet, then you need to configure the HTTP proxy settings for your gateway. You do this by specifying an IP address and port number for the host running your proxy. After you do so, AWS Storage Gateway routes all HTTP traffic through your proxy server. For information about network requirements for your gateway, see Network and firewall requirements.
To configure an HTTP proxy for a file gateway


Log in to your gateway's local console:

Configuring Network Adapters for Your Gateway
By default, AWS Storage Gateway is configured to use the E1000 network adapter type, but you can reconfigure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 (10 GbE) network adapter. You can also configure Storage Gateway so it can be accessed by more than one IP address. You do this by configuring your gateway to use more than one network adapter.
Topics
 Configuring Your Gateway to Use the VMXNET3 Network Adapter
 Configuring Your Gateway for Multiple NICs
Configuring Your Gateway to Use the VMXNET3 Network Adapter
AWS Storage Gateway supports the E1000 network adapter type in both VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor hosts. However, the VMXNET3 (10 GbE) network adapter type is supported in VMware ESXi hypervisor only. If your gateway is hosted on a VMware ESXi hypervisor, you can reconfigure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 (10 GbE) adapter enter. For more information on this adapter, see the VMware website.
For KVM hypervisor hosts, AWS Storage Gateway supports the use of virtio network device drivers. Use of the E1000 network adapter type for KVM hosts isn't supported.
Important
To select VMXNET3, your guest operating system enter must be Other Linux64. 
Following are the steps you take to configure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 adapter: 


Remove the default E1000 adapter.


Add the VMXNET3 adapter.


Restart your gateway.


Configure the adapter for the network.


Details on how to perform each step follow.
To remove the default E1000 adapter and configure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 adapter


In VMware, open the context (right-click) menu for your gateway and choose Edit Settings.


In the Virtual Machine Properties window, choose the Hardware tab.


For Hardware, choose Network adapter. Notice that the current adapter is E1000 in the Adapter Enter section. You replace this adapter with the VMXNET3 adapter.



Choose the E1000 network adapter, and then choose Remove. In this example, the E1000 network adapter is Network adapter 1. 
Note
Although you can run the E1000 and VMXNET3 network adapters in your gateway at the same time, we don't recommend doing so because it can cause network problems.


Choose Add to open the Add Hardware wizard.


Choose Ethernet Adapter, and then choose Next.


In the Network Enter wizard, select VMXNET3 for Adapter Enter, and then choose Next.


In the Virtual Machine properties wizard, verify in the Adapter Enter section that Current Adapter is set to VMXNET3, and then choose OK.


In the VMware VSphere client, shut down your gateway.


In the VMware VSphere client, restart your gateway.


After your gateway restarts, reconfigure the adapter you just added to make sure that network connectivity to the internet is established. 
To configure the adapter for the network


In the VSphere client, choose the Console tab to start the local console. Use the default login credentials to log in to the gateway's local console for this configuration task. For information about how to log in using the default credentials, see Logging In to the File Gateway Local Console.




At the prompt, enter 2 to select Network Configuration, and then press Enter to open the network configuration menu.


At the prompt, enter 4 to select Reset all to DHCP, and then enter y (for yes) at the prompt to set all adapters to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). All available adapters are set to use DHCP.



If your gateway is already activated, you must shut it down and restart it from the AWS Storage Gateway Management Console. After the gateway restarts, you must test network connectivity to the internet. For information about how to test network connectivity, see Testing Your Gateway Connection to the Internet.
Configuring Your Gateway for Multiple NICs
If you configure your gateway to use multiple network adapters (NICs), it can be accessed by more than one IP address. You might want to do this in the following situations:
 *Maximizing throughput â€“ You might want to maximize throughput to a gateway when network adapters are a bottleneck.
 Application separation â€“ You might need to separate how your applications write to a gateway's volumes. For example, you might choose to have a critical storage application exclusively use one particular adapter defined for your gateway.
 Network constraints* â€“ Your application environment might require that you keep your iSCSI targets and the initiators that connect to them in an isolated network. This network is different from the network by which the gateway communicates with AWS.
In a typical multiple-adapter use case, one adapter is configured as the route by which the gateway communicates with AWS (that is, as the default gateway). Except for this one adapter, initiators must be in the same subnet as the adapter that contains the iSCSI targets to which they connect. Otherwise, communication with the intended targets might not be possible. If a target is configured on the same adapter that is used for communication with AWS, then iSCSI traffic for that target and AWS traffic flows through the same adapter.
In some cases, you might configure one adapter to connect to the Storage Gateway console and then add a second adapter. In such a case, Storage Gateway automatically configures the route table to use the second adapter as the preferred route. For instructions on how to configure multiple adapters, see the following sections:
