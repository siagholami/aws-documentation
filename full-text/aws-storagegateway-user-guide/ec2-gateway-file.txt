Deploying a file gateway on an Amazon EC2 host
You can deploy and activate a file gateway on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. The file gateway Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is available as a community AMI.
To deploy a gateway on an Amazon EC2 instance


On the Select host platform page, choose Amazon EC2.


Choose Launch instance to launch a storage gateway EC2 AMI. You are redirected to the Amazon EC2 console where you can choose an instance type.


On the Step 2: Choose an Instance Type page, choose the hardware configuration of your instance. AWS Storage Gateway is supported on instance types that meet certain minimum requirements. We recommend starting with the m4.xlarge instance type, which meets the minimum requirements for your gateway to function properly. For more information, see Hardware requirements for on-premises VMs.


You can resize your instance after you launch, if necessary. For more information, see Resizing your instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Note
Certain instance types, particularly i3 EC2, use NVMe SSD disks. These can cause problems when you start or stop file gateway; for example, you can lose data from the cache. Monitor the CachePercentDirty Amazon CloudWatch metric, and only start or stop your system when that parameter is 0. To learn more about monitoring metrics for your gateway, see Storage Gateway metrics and dimensions in the CloudWatch documentation. For more information about Amazon EC2 instance type requirements, see Requirements for Amazon EC2 instance types.


Choose Next: Configure Instance Details.


On the Step 3: Configure Instance Details page, choose a value for Auto-assign Public IP. If your instance should be accessible from the public internet, verify that Auto-assign Public IP is set to Enable. If your instance shouldn't be accessible from the internet, choose Auto-assign Public IP for Disable.


For IAM role, choose the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you want to use for your gateway.


Choose Next: Add Storage.


On the Step 4: Add Storage page, choose Add New Volume to add storage to your file gateway instance. You need at least one Amazon EBS volume to configure for cache storage.


The following table recommends sizes for local disk storage for your deployed gateway.   
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
Note
You can configure one or more local drives for your cache and upload buffer, up to the maximum capacity.
When adding cache or upload buffer to an existing gateway, it's important to create new disks in your host (hypervisor or Amazon EC2 instance). Don't change the size of existing disks if the disks have been previously allocated as either a cache or upload buffer.


On the Step 5: Add Tags page, you can add an optional tag to your instance. Then choose Next: Configure Security Group.


On the Step 6: Configure Security Group page, add firewall rules to specific traffic to reach your instance. You can create a new security group or choose an existing security group.
Important
Besides the Storage Gateway activation and Secure Shell (SSH) access ports, NFS clients require access to additional ports. For detailed information, see Network and firewall requirements.


Choose Review and Launch to review your configuration.


On the Step 7: Review Instance Launch page, choose Launch.


In the Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair dialog box, choose Choose an existing key pair, and then select the key pair that you created when getting set up. When you are ready, choose the acknowledgment box, and then choose Launch Instances.


A confirmation page tells you that your instance is launching.


Choose View Instances to close the confirmation page and return to the console. On the Instances screen, you can view the status of your instance. It takes a short time for an instance to launch. When you launch an instance, its initial state is pending. After the instance starts, its state changes to running, and it receives a public DNS name


Select your instance, note the public IP address in the Description tag, and return to the Connect to gateway page on the Storage Gateway console to continue your gateway setup.


You can determine the AMI ID to use for launching a file gateway by using the Storage Gateway console or by querying the AWS Systems Manager parameter store.
To determine the AMI ID


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home.


Choose Create gateway, choose File gateway, and then choose Next.


On the Choose host platform page, choose Amazon EC2.


Choose Launch instance to launch a Storage Gateway EC2 AMI. You are redirected to the EC2 community AMI page, where you can see the AMI ID for your AWS Region in the URL.


Or you can query the Systems Manager parameter store. You can use the AWS CLI or Storage Gateway API to query the Systems Manager public parameter under the namespace /aws/service/storagegateway/ami/FILE_S3/latest. For example, using the following CLI command returns the ID of the current AMI in the current AWS Region.
aws --region us-east-2 ssm get-parameter --name /aws/service/storagegateway/ami/FILE_S3/latest
The CLI command returns output similar to the following.
{
       "Parameter": {
           "Type": "String",
           "LastModifiedDate": 1561054105.083,
           "Version": 4,
           "ARN": "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2::parameter/aws/service/storagegateway/ami/FILE_S3/latest",
           "Name": "/aws/service/storagegateway/ami/FILE_S3/latest",
           "Value": "ami-123c45dd67d891000"
       }
   }
