Configuring Quest NetVault Backup to Work with VTL Devices
After you have connected the virtual tape library (VTL) devices to the Windows client, you configure Quest NetVault Backup to recognize your devices. For information about how to connect VTL devices to the Windows client, see Connecting Your VTL Devices.
The Quest NetVault Backup application doesn't automatically recognize tape gateway devices. You must manually add the devices to expose them to the Quest NetVault Backup application and then discover the VTL devices.
Adding VTL Devices
To add the VTL devices


In Quest NetVault Backup, choose Manage Devices in the Configuration tab.


On the Manage Devices page, choose Add Devices.


In the Add Storage Wizard, choose Tape library / media changer, and then choose Next.



On the next page, choose the client machine that is physically attached to the library and choose Next to scan for devices.


If devices are found, they are displayed. In this case, your medium changer is displayed in the device box.


Choose your medium changer and choose Next. Detailed information about the device is displayed in the wizard.


On the Add Tapes to Bays page, choose Scan For Devices, choose your client machine, and then choose Next. 


All your drives are displayed on the page. Quest NetVault Backup displays the 10 bays to which you can add your drives. The bays are displayed one at a time.



Choose the drive you want to add to the bay that is displayed, and then choose Next.
Important
When you add a drive to a bay, the drive and bay numbers must match. For example, if bay 1 is displayed, you must add drive 1. If a drive is not connected, leave its matching bay empty.


When your client machine appears, choose it, and then choose Next. The client machine can appear multiple times.


When the drives are displayed, repeat steps 7 through 9 to add all the drives to the bays.


In the Configuration tab, choose Manage devices and on the Manage Devices page, expand your medium changer to see the devices that you added.


Backing Up Data to a Tape in the Quest NetVault Backup
You create a backup job and write data to a virtual tape by using the same procedures you do with physical tapes. For detailed information about how to back up data, see the Quest NetVault Backup 12.4 - Administration Guide.
Archiving a Tape by Using the Quest NetVault Backup
When you archive a tape, a tape gateway ejects the tape from the tape drive to the storage slot. It then exports the tape from the slot to the archive by using your backup application—that is, the Quest NetVault Backup.
To archive a tape in Quest NetVault Backup


In the Quest NetVault Backup Configuration tab, choose and expand your medium changer to see your tapes.


On the Slots row, choose the settings icon to open the Slots Browser for the medium changer. 



In the slots, locate the tape you want to archive, choose it, and then choose Export.



The archiving process can take some time to complete. The initial status of the tape appears as IN TRANSIT TO VTS. When archiving starts, the status changes to ARCHIVING. When archiving is completed, the tape is no longer listed in the VTL.
In the Quest NetVault Backup software, verify that the tape is no longer in the storage slot.
In the navigation pane of the Storage Gateway console, choose Tapes. Verify that your archived tape's status is ARCHIVED. 
Restoring Data from a Tape Archived in Quest NetVault Backup
Restoring your archived data is a two-step process.
To restore data from an archived tape


Retrieve the archived tape from archive to a tape gateway. For instructions, see Retrieving Archived Tapes.


Use the Quest NetVault Backup application to restore the data. You do this by creating a restoring a folder file, as you do when restoring data from physical tapes. For instructions on creating a restore job, see Quest NetVault Backup 12.4 - Administration Guide.
