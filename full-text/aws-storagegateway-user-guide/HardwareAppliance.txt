Using the AWS Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance
The AWS Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance is a physical hardware appliance with Storage Gateway software preinstalled on a third-party server. You can manage your hardware appliance from the Hardware page on the AWS Management Console.
When you create a new gateway in the Storage Gateway console, you have the option to run the gateway appliance on virtual platforms. Storage Gateway supports VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM), and Amazon EC2 as hosts. 
You can also use the hardware appliance as a host in Europe in addition the United States. If you don't already own a hardware appliance and you choose to use one, go to the Amazon US or Amazon UK, or Amazon Germany website and purchase one. You can also purchase one from the Storage Gateway console. From the Hardware page, you choose Buy Hardware Appliance. You are directed to the appropriate Amazon website, where you can purchase the appliance.
The hardware appliance is a high-performance 1U server that you can deploy in your data center, or on-premises inside your corporate firewall. When you buy and activate your hardware appliance, the activation process associates your hardware appliance with your AWS account. After activation, your hardware appliance appears in the console as a gateway on the Hardware page. You can configure your hardware appliance as a file gateway, tape gateway, or volume gateway type. The procedure that you use to deploy and activate these gateway types on a hardware appliance is same as on a virtual platform.
