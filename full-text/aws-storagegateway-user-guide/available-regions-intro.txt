AWS Regions
AWS Storage Gateway stores volume, snapshot, tape, and file data in the AWS Region in which your gateway is activated. File data is stored in the AWS Region where your Amazon S3 bucket is located. You select an AWS Region at the upper right of the AWS Storage Gateway Management Console before you start deploying your gateway.
