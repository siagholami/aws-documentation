Monitoring Storage Gateway
In this section, you can find information about how to monitor a gateway, including monitoring resources associated with the gateway, using Amazon CloudWatch. You can monitor the gateway's upload buffer and cache storage. You use the AWS Storage Gateway console to view metrics and alarms for your gateway. For example, you can view the number of bytes used in read and write operations, the time spent in read and write operations, and the time taken to retrieve data from the AWS Cloud. With metrics, you can track the health of your gateway and set up alarms to notify you when one or more metrics fall outside a defined threshold.
Storage Gateway provides CloudWatch metrics at no additional charge. Storage Gateway metrics are recorded for a period of two weeks. By using these metrics, you can access historical information and get a better perspective on how your gateway and volumes are performing. Storage Gateway also provides CloudWatch alarms, except high-resolution alarms, at no additional charge. For more information about CloudWatch pricing, see Amazon CloudWatch pricing. For more information about CloudWatch, see Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

Understanding gateway metrics
For the discussion in this topic, we define gateway metrics as metrics that are scoped to the gatewayâ€”that is, they measure something about the gateway. Because a gateway contains one or more volumes, a gateway-specific metric is representative of all volumes on the gateway. For example, the CloudBytesUploaded metric is the total number of bytes that the gateway sent to the cloud during the reporting period. This metric includes the activity of all the volumes on the gateway.
When working with gateway metric data, you specify the unique identification of the gateway that you are interested in viewing metrics for. To do this, you specify both the GatewayId and the GatewayName values. When you want to work with metric for a gateway, you specify the gateway dimension in the metrics namespace, which distinguishes a gateway-specific metric from a volume-specific metric. For more information, see Using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics.

Dimensions for Storage Gateway metrics
The CloudWatch namespace for the Storage Gateway service is AWS/StorageGateway. Data is available automatically in 5-minute periods at no charge.



Dimension
Description




GatewayId, GatewayName
These dimensions filter the data that you request to gateway-specific metrics. You can identify a gateway to work by the value for GatewayId or GatewayName. If the name of your gateway was different for the time range that you are interested in viewing metrics, use the GatewayId. Throughput and latency data of a gateway is based on all the volumes for the gateway. For information about working with gateway metrics, see Measuring Performance Between Your Gateway and AWS.


VolumeId
This dimension filters the data you request to volume-specific metrics. Identify a storage volume to work with by its VolumeId value. For information about working with volume metrics, see Measuring Performance Between Your Application and Gateway.



Monitoring the upload buffer
You can find information following about how to monitor a gateway's upload buffer and how to create an alarm so that you get a notification when the buffer exceeds a specified threshold. By using this approach, you can add buffer storage to a gateway before it fills completely and your storage application stops backing up to AWS.
You monitor the upload buffer in the same way in both the cached-volume and tape gateway architectures. For more information, see How AWS Storage Gateway Works (Architecture).
Note
The WorkingStoragePercentUsed, WorkingStorageUsed, and WorkingStorageFree metrics represent the upload buffer for stored volumes only before the release of the cached-volume feature in Storage Gateway. Now, use the equivalent upload buffer metrics UploadBufferPercentUsed, UploadBufferUsed, and UploadBufferFree. These metrics apply to both gateway architectures.

How to Measure




Total usage of cache
Use the CachePercentUsed and TotalCacheSize metrics with the Average statistic. For example, use the CachePercentUsed with the Average statistic to analyze the cache usage over a period of time. The TotalCacheSize metric changes only when you add cache to the gateway.


Percent of read requests that are served from the cache
Use the CacheHitPercent metric with the Average statistic. Typically, you want CacheHitPercent to remain high.


Percent of the cache that is dirtyâ€”that is, it contains content that has not been uploaded to AWS
Use the CachePercentDirty metrics with the Average statistic. Typically, you want CachePercentDirty to remain low.



To measure the percent of a cache that is dirty for a gateway and all its volumes


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


Choose the StorageGateway: Gateway Metrics dimension, and find the gateway that you want to work with.


Choose the CachePercentDirty metric.


For Time Range, choose a value.


Choose the Average statistic.


For Period, choose a value of 5 minutes to match the default reporting time.


The resulting time-ordered set of data points contains the percentage of the cache that is dirty over the 5 minutes.
To measure the percent of the cache that is dirty for a volume


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


Choose the StorageGateway: Volume Metrics dimension, and find the volume that you want to work with.


Choose the CachePercentDirty metric.


For Time Range, choose a value.


Choose the Average statistic.


For Period, choose a value of 5 minutes to match the default reporting time.


The resulting time-ordered set of data points contains the percentage of the cache that is dirty over the 5 minutes.
Understanding CloudWatch alarms
You can add CloudWatch alarms to your Storage Gateway console and monitor them visually. When an alarm is present, it turns red when it is in the ALARM state, making it easier for you to monitor its status proactively. Alarms invoke actions for sustained state changes only. Alarms don't invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state. The state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods. For more information about CloudWatch alarms, see Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms.
Note
If you don't have permission to view CloudWatch, you can't view the alarms.
For each activated gateway, we recommend that you create the following CloudWatch alarms:
 High IO wait: IoWaitpercent >= 20 for 3 datapoints in 15 minutes
 Cache percent dirty: CachePercentDirty > 80 for 4 datapoints within 20 minutes
 Availability notifications: AvailabilityNotifications >= 1 for 1 datapoints within 5 minutes
 Health notifications: HealthNotifications >= 1 for 1 datapoints within 5 minutes
Note
You can set a health notification alarm only if the gateway had a previous health notification in CloudWatch.
The following table describes the state of an alarm. 



State
Description




OK
The metric or expression is within the defined threshold.


Alarm
The metric or expression is outside of the defined threshold.


Insufficient data
The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.


None
No alarms are created for the gateway. To create a new alarm, see Creating an CloudWatch alarm for Storage Gateway.


Unavailable
The state of the alarm is unknown. Choose Unavailable to view error information in the Monitoring tab.



Creating an CloudWatch alarm for Storage Gateway
CloudWatch uses Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send alarm notifications when an alarm changes state. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period you specify, and performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic. You can create an Amazon SNS topic when you create a CloudWatch alarm. For more information about Amazon SNS, see What is Amazon SNS? in the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide.
To create a CloudWatch alarm in the Storage Gateway console


Open the Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home/.


In the navigation pane, choose Gateways.


Choose a gateway, and then choose the alarm state or the Monitoring tab.


Do one of the following:
    If there are no alarms, choose CloudWatch Alarms.
    If there is an existing alarm, choose Create alarm.


The CloudWatch console opens.


Create an alarm. The following are the types of CloudWatch alarms:
    Static threshold alarm: An alarm based on a set threshold for a chosen metric. The alarm goes to ALARM state when the metric breaches the threshold for a specified number of evaluation periods.
To create a static threshold alarm, see Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on a static threshold in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
    Anomaly detection alarm: Anomaly detection mines past metric data and creates a model of expected values. You set a value for the anomaly detection threshold, and CloudWatch uses this threshold with the model to determine the "normal" range of values for the metric. A higher value for the threshold produces a thicker band of "normal" values. You can choose whether the alarm is triggered when the metric value is above the band of expected values, below the band, or either above or below the band.
To create an anomaly detection alarm, see Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on anomaly detection in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
    Metric math expression alarm: An alarm based one or more metrics used in a math expression. You specify the expression, threshold, and evaluation periods.
To create a metric math expression alarm, see Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on a metric math expression in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
    Composite alarm: An alarm that determines its alarm state by watching the alarm states of other alarms. A composite alarm can help you reduce alarm noise.
To create a composite alarm, see Creating a composite alarm in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.


After you create the alarm in the CloudWatch console, return to the Storage Gateway console. You can view the alarm by doing one of the following:
    In the navigation pane, choose Gateways, and then choose a gateway. On the Details tab, for Alarms, choose CloudWatch Alarms.
    In the navigation pane, choose Gateways, then choose a gateway, and then choose the Monitoring tab.
    In the navigation pane, choose Gateways, and then choose the alarm state of a gateway.
