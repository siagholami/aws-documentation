Working with Keybindings in the AWS Cloud9 Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Keybindings define your shortcut key combinations. Keybindings apply across each AWS Cloud9 development environment associated with your IAM user. As you make changes to your keybindings, AWS Cloud9 pushes those changes to the cloud, and associates them with your IAM user. AWS Cloud9 also continually scans the cloud for changes to keybindings associated with your IAM user, and applies those changes to your current environment.
You can share your keybindings with other users.

Share Your Keybindings with Another User


In both the source and target environment, on the menu bar of the AWS Cloud9 IDE, choose AWS Cloud9, Open Your Keymap.


In the source environment, copy the contents of the keybindings.settings tab that is displayed.


In the target environment, overwrite the contents of the keybindings.settings tab with the copied contents from the source environment.


In the target environment, save the keybindings.settings tab.


Change Your Keyboard Mode
You can change the keyboard mode that the AWS Cloud9 IDE uses for interacting with text in the editor across each environment associated with your IAM user.


On the menu bar, choose AWS Cloud9, Preferences.


On the Preferences tab, in the side navigation pane, choose Keybindings.


For Keyboard Mode, choose one of these keyboard modes:
     Default to use a set of default keybindings.
     Vim to use Vim mode. For more information, see the Vim help files website.
     Emacs to use Emacs mode. For more information, see The Emacs Editor on the GNU Operating System website.
     Sublime to use Sublime mode. For more information, see the Sublime Text Documentation website.


Change Your Operating System Keybindings
You can change the set of operating system keybindings the AWS Cloud9 IDE recognizes across each environment associated with your IAM user.


On the menu bar, choose AWS Cloud9, Preferences.


On the Preferences tab, in the side navigation pane, choose Keybindings.


For Operating System, choose one of these operating systems:
     Auto for the AWS Cloud9 IDE to attempt to detect which set of operating system keybindings to use.
     MacOS for the AWS Cloud9 IDE to use the keybindings listed in Mac format.
     Windows / Linux for the AWS Cloud9 IDE to use the keybindings listed in Windows and Linux formats.


Change Specific Keybindings
You can change individual keybindings across each environment associated with your IAM user.
To change one keybinding at a time


On the menu bar, choose AWS Cloud9, Preferences.


On the Preferences tab, in the side navigation pane, choose Keybindings.


In the list of keybindings, double-click the keybinding in the Keystroke column you want to change.


Use the keyboard to specify the replacement key combination, and then press Enter.
Note
To completely remove the current key combination, press Backspace for Windows or Linux, or Delete for Mac.


To change multiple keybindings at once


On the menu bar, choose AWS Cloud9, Open Your Keymap.


In the keybindings.settings file, define each keybinding to be changed, for example:


[
     {
       "command": "addfavorite",
       "keys": {
         "win": ["Ctrl-Alt-F"],
         "mac": ["Ctrl-Option-F"]
       }
     },
     {
       "command": "copyFilePath",
       "keys": {
         "win": ["Ctrl-Shift-F"],
         "mac": ["Alt-Shift-F"]
       }
     }
   ]
In the example, addFavorite and copyFilePath are the names of keybindings in the Keystroke column in the Keybindings pane on the Preferences tab. The keybindings you want are win and mac for Windows or Linux and Mac, respectively.
To apply your changes, save the keybindings.settings file. Your changes should appear in the Keybindings pane after a short delay.
Remove All of Your Custom Keybindings
You can remove all custom keybindings and restore all keybindings to their default values, across each environment associated with your IAM user.
Warning
You cannot undo this action.


On the menu bar, choose AWS Cloud9, Preferences.


On the Preferences tab, in the side navigation pane, choose Keybindings.


Choose Reset to Defaults.
