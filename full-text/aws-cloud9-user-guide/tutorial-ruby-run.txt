Step 3: Run the Code
(Previous step: Step 2: Add Code)


In the AWS Cloud9 IDE, on the menu bar, choose Run, Run Configurations, New Run Configuration.


On the [New] - Idle tab, choose Runner: Auto, and then choose Ruby (item 1 in the screenshot shown below).


For Command (item 2 in the screenshot), type hello.rb 5 9. Given this command, ARGV[0] in the code receives a value of 5 and ARGV[1] receives a value of 9.


Choose the Run button (item 3 below), and compare your output to the following.


Hello, World!
   The sum of 2 and 3 is 5.
   The sum of 5 and 9 is 14.
