Step 1: Install Required Tools
(First step of Tutorial: Ruby in AWS Cloud9)
In this step, you install Ruby, which is required to run this tutorial.


In a terminal session in the AWS Cloud9 IDE, confirm whether Ruby is already installed by running the  ruby --version  command. (To start a new terminal session, on the menu bar, choose Window, New Terminal.) If successful, the output contains the Ruby version number. If Ruby is installed, skip ahead to Step 2: Add Code.


Run the  yum update  for (Amazon Linux) or  apt update  for (Ubuntu Server) command to help ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are installed.


For Amazon Linux:
sudo yum -y update
For Ubuntu Server:
sudo apt update

Install Ruby by running the  install  command.

For Amazon Linux:
sudo yum -y install ruby
For Ubuntu Server:
sudo apt install -y ruby
