What Is AWS Data Exchange?
AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to securely exchange file-based data sets in the AWS Cloud.
As a subscriber, you can find and subscribe to hundreds of products from qualified data providers. Then, you can quickly download the data set or copy it to Amazon S3 for use across a variety of AWS analytics and machine learning services. Anyone with an AWS account can be a AWS Data Exchange subscriber. For information about becoming a subscriber, see Subscribing to Data Products on AWS Data Exchange.
For providers, AWS Data Exchange eliminates the need to build and maintain any data delivery, entitlement, or billing technology. Providers in AWS Data Exchange have a secure, transparent, and reliable channel to reach AWS customers and grant existing customers their subscriptions more efficiently. The process for becoming an AWS Data Exchange provider requires a few steps to determine eligibility. For more information, see Register to Be a Provider.
What Is An AWS Data Exchange Product?
A product is the unit of exchange in AWS Data Exchange that is published by a provider and made available for use to subscribers. When a provider publishes a product, that product is listed on AWS Data Exchange and AWS Marketplace. A product has the following parts:
 Product details – This information includes name, descriptions (both short and long), logo image, and support contact information. Providers complete the product details. For more information as a subscriber, see Product Subscriptions. For more information as a provider, see Filling Out Product Details.
 Product offers – To make a product available on AWS Data Exchange, providers must define a public offer. This offer includes prices and durations, data subscription agreement, refund policy, and the option to create custom offers. For more information, see Creating an Offer for AWS Data Exchange Products.
 Data sets – A product can contain one or more data sets. A data set is a dynamic set of file-based content. Data sets are dynamic and are versioned through the use of revisions. Each revision can contain multiple assets. For more information, see Working with Data Sets.
Malware Prevention
Security and compliance is a shared responsibility between you and AWS. To promote a safe, secure, and trustworthy service for everyone, AWS Data Exchange scans all data published by providers before it is made available to subscribers. If AWS detects malware, the affected asset is removed.
Important
AWS Data Exchange does not guarantee that the data you consume as a subscriber is free of any potential malware. We encourage that you conduct your own additional due-diligence to ensure compliance with your internal security controls. You can find anti-malware and security products in AWS Marketplace.
Supported Data Sets
AWS Data Exchange takes a responsible approach to facilitating data transactions by promoting transparency through use of the service. AWS Data Exchange reviews permitted data types, restricting products that are not permitted. Providers are limited to distributing data sets that meet the legal eligibility requirements set forth in the Terms and Conditions for AWS Marketplace Sellers.
For more information about permitted data types, see Publishing Guidelines.
Important
As an AWS customer, you are encouraged to conduct your own additional due-diligence to ensure compliance with any applicable data privacy laws. If you suspect that a product or other resources on AWS Data Exchange are being used for abusive or illegal purposes, report it using the Report Amazon AWS abuse form.
