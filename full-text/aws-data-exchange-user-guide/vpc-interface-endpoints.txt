AWS Data Exchange and interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)
You can establish a private connection between your VPC and AWS Data Exchange by creating an interface VPC endpoint. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access AWS Data Exchange APIs without an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC don't need public IP addresses to communicate with AWS Data Exchange APIs. Traffic between your VPC and AWS Data Exchange does not leave the Amazon network. 
Each interface endpoint is represented by one or more Elastic Network Interfaces in your subnets. 
For more information, see Interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) in the Amazon VPC User Guide. 
Considerations for AWS Data Exchange VPC endpoints
Before you set up an interface VPC endpoint for AWS Data Exchange, ensure that you review Interface endpoint properties and limitations in the Amazon VPC User Guide. 
AWS Data Exchange supports making calls to all of its API actions from your VPC. 
VPC endpoint policies are not supported for AWS Data Exchange. By default, full access to AWS Data Exchange is allowed through the endpoint. For more information, see Controlling access to services with VPC endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Creating an interface VPC endpoint for AWS Data Exchange
You can create a VPC endpoint for the AWS Data Exchange service using either the Amazon VPC console or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For more information, see Creating an interface endpoint in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Create a VPC endpoint for AWS Data Exchange using the following service name: 
 com.amazonaws.region.dataexchange
If you enable private DNS for the endpoint, you can make API requests to AWS Data Exchange using its default DNS name for the Region, for example, com.amazonaws.us-east-1.dataexchange.
For more information, see Accessing a service through an interface endpoint in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Creating a VPC endpoint policy for AWS Data Exchange
You can attach an endpoint policy to your VPC endpoint that controls access to AWS Data Exchange. The policy specifies the following information:
 The principal that can perform actions.
 The actions that can be performed.
 The resources on which actions can be performed.
For more information, see Controlling access to services with VPC endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide. 
Example: VPC endpoint policy for AWS Data Exchange actions
The following is an example of an endpoint policy for AWS Data Exchange. When attached to an endpoint, this policy grants access to the listed AWS Data Exchange actions for all principals on all resources.
This example VPC endpoint policy allows full access only to the IAM user bts in AWS account 123456789012 from vpc-12345678. The IAM user readUser is allowed to read the resources, but all other IAM principals are denied access to the endpoint.
