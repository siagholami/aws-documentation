Provider Financials on AWS Marketplace
The following topics cover financial information about providing data through AWS Data Exchange.
AWS Data Exchange is integrated with AWS Marketplace. If you want to register as an AWS Data Exchange provider, you must first register as an AWS Marketplace seller. As an AWS Data Exchange provider, you benefit from AWS Marketplace features, such as Seller Reports and the AWS Marketplace Commerce Analytics Service. For more information, see Seller Reports and Data Feed and AWS Marketplace Enhanced Data Sharing Program in the AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.
Payments
AWS disburses payments monthly directly to the bank account associated with the AWS account registered as a seller, minus AWS Marketplace service fees. Payment is disbursed on a rolling monthly basis based on when the account was created, not the beginning of each month. Funds are disbursed to you only after they are collected from the subscriber. For more information, see Disbursement in the AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.
U.S. Sales and Use Tax
AWS Marketplace Tax Calculation Service makes it possible to calculate and collect U.S. sales and use tax for existing and new products. Some states are not eligible for Tax Calculation Service because AWS Marketplace is required by law to collect and remit applicable sales tax attributable to taxable sales of your products to subscribers based in these states. To use the service, configure your tax nexus settings for your provider profile, and then assign product tax codes to your products. 
To configure your tax nexus settings
 Open the AWS Marketplace Management Portal. On the Settings tab, configure the applicable tax nexus settings.
For more information, see Seller Registration Process on the AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.
AWS Marketplace Seller Reports
As an AWS Data Exchange provider, you receive reports detailing the subscription activity of your products. There are several reports available to track daily and monthly data. The reports include information about the subscription activity for your offers, payment received from subscribers, and money being disbursed to you. Disbursement doesn't occur until payment is received from the AWS customer. For more information, see Seller Reports in the AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.
As an AWS Data Exchange provider, you might be eligible for the AWS Marketplace Enhanced Data Sharing program. For more information, see AWS Marketplace Enhanced Data Sharing Program.
Subscriber Refund Requests
As a provider, you control the refund policy for your products, which you must specify when you create your product. AWS Data Exchange doesn't require you to offer refunds. You must approve all requests for refunds before AWS process them on your behalf.
Submit a refund approval formÂ to AWS Support. They process your request and issue the refund to the subscriber. You can view all refunds that AWS processed on your behalf in the Monthly Billed Revenue Report.
