What Is AWS Data Exchange Heartbeat?
AWS Data Exchange Heartbeat (Test product) is a free product that is made available to subscribers to understand how to interact with a AWS Data Exchange product subscription. You can use it for testing purposes and to get familiar with the AWS Data Exchange APIs and concepts.
AWS Data Exchange Heartbeat contains a single data set named Heartbeat. Approximately every 15 minutes, a new revision is published to this data set.
Example Content of a Revision
Each new revision contains two assets:
 Epoch asset
 Manifest asset
Epoch Asset
Each AWS Data Exchange Heartbeat revision contains a JSON file S3 object that contains a single array. The array's name is TimestampsSinceLastRevision and its value is a list of each UNIX Epoch second that has elapsed since the last revision.
The name of the asset is in the form Epoch{start}-{end}.json where {start} and {end} represent the Epoch seconds corresponding to the period of time covered by the revision.
Manifest Asset
Each AWS Data Exchange Heartbeat revision contains a JSON file S3 object that contains metadata about the revision and the schema of the Epoch asset JSON file. The name of the asset is in the form Manifest{start}-{end}.json where {start} and {end} represent the Epoch seconds corresponding to the period of time covered by the revision. This example shows the content of a manifest file:
{
        "manifestSchemaVersion":"1.0",
        "schema":"{
                \"type\":\"object\",
                \"properties\":{
                    \"TimestampsSinceLastRevision\":{
                        \"type\":\"array\",
                        \"description\":\"List of epoch timestamps in seconds.\",
                        \"items\":{
                            \"type\":\"number\",
                            \"description\":\"Epoch timestamp in seconds.\"
                         }
                     }
                 }
        }",
        "startTimestamp":1554898111,
        "endTimestamp":1554905311,
        "numberOfTimestamps":7201
