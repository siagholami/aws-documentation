In this getting started exercise, you enable AWS Single Sign-On, connect your directory, set up SSO to your AWS accounts, and finally set up SSO to your cloud applications. Although not required, we recommend that you review Understanding Key AWS Single Sign-On Concepts before you begin using the console so that you are familiar with the core features and terminology.
