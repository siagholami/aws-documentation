Certificate Expiration Status Indicators
While on the Manage SAML 2.0 certificates page, you might notice colored status indicator icons. These icons appear in the Expires on column next to each certificate in the list. The following describes the criteria that AWS SSO uses to determine which icon is displayed for each certificate.
 Red – Indicates that a certificate is currently expired.
 Yellow – Indicates that a certificate will expire in 90 days or less.
 Green – Indicates that a certificate is currently valid and will remain valid for at least 90 more days.

On the SAML 2.0 authentication page, under Identity provider metadata, choose Manage certificates.


On the Manage SAML 2.0 certificates page, review the status of the certificates in the list as indicated in the Expires on column.
