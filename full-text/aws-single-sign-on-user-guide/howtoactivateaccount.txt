If this is your first time signing into the user portal, check your email for instructions on how to activate your account. 
To activate your account


Depending on the email you received from your company, choose one of the following methods to activate your account so that you can start using the user portal. 


If you received an email with the subject Invitation to join AWS Single Sign-On, open it and choose Accept invitation, which takes you to the Single Sign-On page. Here you specify a password, which you use each time you sign in to the portal. Once you have provided a password and have confirmed it, choose Update User.


If you were sent an email from your company's IT support or IT administrator, follow the instructions they provided to activate your account. 


Once you activate your account by providing a new password, the user portal signs you in automatically. If this does not occur, you can manually sign in to the user portal using the instructions provided in the next step.
