Cloud Applications
You can use the AWS SSO application configuration wizard to include built-in SAML integrations to many popular cloud applications. Examples include Salesforce, Box, and Office 365. For a complete list of applications that you can add from the wizard, see Supported Applications.
Most cloud applications come with detailed instructions on how to set up the trust between AWS SSO and the application's service provider. You can find these instructions on the cloud applications configuration page during the setup process and after the application has been set up. After the application has been configured, you can assign access to the groups or users that require it.
Supported Applications
AWS SSO has built-in support for the following commonly used cloud applications.
Note
AWS Support engineers can assist customers who have Business and Enterprise support plans with some integration tasks that involve third-party software. For a current list of supported platforms and applications, see Third-Party Software Support on the AWS Support Features page.

Add and Configure a Cloud Application
Use this procedure when you need to set up a SAML trust relationship between AWS SSO and your cloud application's service provider. Before you begin this procedure, make sure you have the service provider's metadata exchange file so that you can more efficiently set up the trust. If you do not have this file, you can still use this procedure to configure it manually.
To add and configure a cloud application


In the AWS SSO console, choose Applications in the left navigation pane. Then choose Add a new application.


In the Select an application dialog box, select the application you want to add from the list. Then choose Add. 


On the Configure  page, under Details, enter a Display name for the application, such as Salesforce.


Under AWS SSO metadata, do the following:


Next to AWS SSO SAML metadatafile, choose Download to download the identity provider metadata.


Next to AWS SSO certificate, choose Download certificate to download the identity provider certificate.
Note
You will need these files later when you set up the cloud application from the service provider's website. Follow the instructions from that provider. 


(Optional) Under Application properties, you can specify additional properties for the Application start URL, Relay State, and Session Duration. For more information, see Application Properties.


Under Application metadata, provide the Application ACS URL and Application SAML audience values.


Choose Save changes to save the configuration.
