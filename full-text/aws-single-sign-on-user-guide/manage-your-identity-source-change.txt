Change Your Identity Source
You can change where you store users at any time. Use the following procedure to switch from a directory that AWS SSO provides (the default) to an external identity provider, AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory or vice versa. Make sure to review identity source considerations before proceeding. For more information, see Considerations for Changing Your Identity Source.
To change your identity source


Open the AWS SSO console.


Choose Settings


On the Settings page, under Identity source, choose Change.


On the Change identity source page, select the source you want to switch to, and then choose Next. If you are switching to a Microsoft AD directory, you must choose the available directory from the provided menu. 
Important
Changing your source to or from Active Directory removes all existing user and group assignments. You must manually reapply assignments after you have successfully changed your source.


Choose Next: Review.


Once you have read the disclaimer and are ready to proceed, type CONFIRM.


Choose Finish.
