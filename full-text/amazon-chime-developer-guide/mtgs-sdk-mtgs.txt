Creating meetings with the Amazon Chime SDK
The following procedure demonstrates how to create a meeting with audio and video for your server and client applications. Before you begin, you must integrate your client application with an Amazon Chime SDK client library. For more information, see Integrating with a client library.
To create a meeting with audio and video


Complete the following steps from your server application:


Use the CreateMeeting API action in the Amazon Chime API Reference to create a meeting. Optionally, specify an AWS Region using the MediaRegion parameter. For more information about choosing a media Region, see Amazon Chime SDK media Regions.


Add attendees to the meeting using either the CreateAttendee API action or the BatchCreateAttendee API action. 


Securely transfer the meeting and attendee from your server application to the client authorized as the respective attendee. For more information about meetings and attendees, see Meeting and Attendee in the Amazon Chime API Reference.


Complete the following steps from your client application:


Use an Amazon Chime SDK client library to construct a MeetingSessionConfiguration object. Use the meeting and attendee information from the previous steps.


Implement the AudioVideoObserver interface.


Create a MeetingSession using the MeetingSessionConfiguration.


Use the AudioVideoFacade from the MeetingSession to control real-time media.


Register an instance of the AudioVideoObserver interface. This lets you receive events when the meeting state changes.


Select initial devices for the audio input, audio output, and video input.


Start the audiovisual session.


Start local video capture when the user wants to share video.


To show video tiles, manage video tile events, and bind the tiles to video surfaces in the client application.


Manage other user interactions such as muting and unmuting, or starting and stopping local video capture.


To leave the meeting, stop the audiovisual session.




(Optional) Use the AudioVideoFacade from the MeetingSession to share media content, such as screen captures, with other clients.


Start the screen share session. The content joins the meeting as an additional attendee.


To view the shared content, manage video tile events and bind the tiles to surfaces in the client application.


Manage other interactions, such as pausing, restarting, or stopping the content share.




The meetings end when you run the DeleteMeeting API action. A meeting automatically ends after a period of inactivity, such as the following:
 No audio connections are present in the meeting for more than five minutes. 
 Fewer than two audio connections are present in the meeting for more than 30 minutes. 
 Screen share viewer connections are inactive for more than 30 minutes.
 The meeting time exceeds 24 hours.
