Amazon Chime SDK media Regions
We recommend specifying an AWS Region for your Amazon Chime SDK meeting using the MediaRegion parameter in the CreateMeeting API action. Available media Regions for Amazon Chime SDK meetings include the following:
 US East (Ohio) (us-east-2)
 US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)
 US West (N. California) (us-west-1)
 US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)
 Asia Pacific (Singapore) (ap-southeast-1)
 Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)
 Asia Pacific (Tokyo) (ap-northeast-1)
 Canada (Central) (ca-central-1)
 Europe (Frankfurt) (eu-central-1)
 Europe (Ireland) (eu-west-1)
 Europe (London) (eu-west-2)
 Europe (Paris) (eu-west-3)
 Europe (Stockholm) (eu-north-1)
 South America (SÃ£o Paulo) (sa-east-1)
For more information about available media Regions, see the MediaRegion definition for CreateMeeting in the Amazon Chime API Reference.
Note
The preceding media Regions are used for hosting Amazon Chime SDK meetings. This differs from the Amazon Chime API, which has a single endpoint. For more information, see Amazon Chime endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
Choosing a media Region
When choosing a media Region to use for your Amazon Chime SDK meeting, common factors to consider include the following:
Regulatory requirements
If your Amazon Chime SDK meetings are subject to regulations requiring them to be hosted within a geopolitical border, consider hardcoding the meeting Region based on fixed application logic.
For example, a telemedicine application might require all meetings to be hosted within the medical practitioner's jurisdiction. If the application supports clinics located in both Europe and the United States, you can use each clinic's address to select a Region within its jurisdiction.
Meeting quality
When an Amazon Chime SDK meeting is hosted in a media Region, each attendee's audio and video is sent and received from that Region. As the distance between the attendee and the Region increases, meeting quality can be affected by network latency. Specifying a Region for your Amazon Chime SDK meeting can help enhance the meeting quality for your attendees, whether they are located near each other or distributed geographically.
You can use one of the following methods to choose a media Region for your Amazon Chime SDK meeting:
Hardcode a media Region
Recommended if your Amazon Chime SDK meetings are all hosted within a specific AWS Region.
Choose the nearest media Region
Recommended if your Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendees are located in the same AWS Region, but your meetings are hosted in different Regions.
For more details about choosing the nearest media Region, see the following topic.
Choosing the nearest media Region
Call https://nearest-media-region.l.chime.aws to identify the nearest media Region that can host your Amazon Chime SDK meeting. Make the call from the client application, not the server application. Pass the call to the application before your attendees need to join the meeting, such as at the time that the application starts up.
Your request returns a JSON object showing the AWS Region that is nearest to you.
Example : Call to https://nearest-media-region.l.chime.aws
The following example shows the contents of a request sent to https://nearest-media-region.l.chime.aws to identify the nearest media Region.  
async getNearestMediaRegion(): Promise<string> {
    var nearestMediaRegion = '';
    const defaultMediaRegion = 'us-east-1';
    try {
      const nearestMediaRegionResponse = await fetch(
        `https://nearest-media-region.l.chime.aws`,
        {
          method: 'GET',
        }
      );
      const nearestMediaRegionJSON = await nearestMediaRegionResponse.json();
      this.log(nearestMediaRegionJSON.region);
      nearestMediaRegion = nearestMediaRegionJSON.region;
    } catch (error) {
      nearestMediaRegion = defaultMediaRegion;
      this.log('Default media region '  defaultMediaRegion  ' selected: '  error.message);
    } finally {
      return nearestMediaRegion;
    }
  }
