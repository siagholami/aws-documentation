deleteUser
The deleteUser command in cloudhsm_mgmt_util deletes a user from the HSMs. Only crypto officers (COs and PCOs) can run this command, but any CO user can delete any user of any type from the HSMs. However, you cannot delete a user who is logged into the AWS CloudHSM client, key_mgmt_util, or cloudhsm_mgmt_util.
Warning
When you delete a crypto user (CU), all keys that the user owned are deleted, even if the keys were shared with other users. To make accidental or malicious deletion of users less likely, use quorum authentication. 
Before you run any cloudhsm_mgmt_util command, you must start cloudhsm_mgmt_util and log in to the HSM. Be sure that you log in with the user account type that can run the commands you plan to use.
If you add or delete HSMs, update the configuration files that the AWS CloudHSM client and the command line tools use. Otherwise, the changes that you make might not be effective for all HSMs in the cluster.
User Type
The following types of users can run this command.
 Crypto officers (CO, PCO)
Syntax
Because this command does not have named parameters, you must enter the arguments in the order specified in the syntax diagram.
deleteUser <user-type> <user-name>
Example
This example deletes a crypto officer (CO) from the HSMs in a cluster. The first command uses listUsers to list all users on the HSMs.
The output shows that user 3, alice, is a CO on the HSMs.
```

```
The second command uses the deleteUser command to delete alice from the HSMs. 
The output shows that the command succeeded on all three HSMs in the cluster.
aws-cloudhsm> deleteUser CO alice
Deleting user alice(CO) on 3 nodes
deleteUser success on server 0(10.0.0.1)
deleteUser success on server 0(10.0.0.2)
deleteUser success on server 0(10.0.0.3)
The final command uses the listUsers command to verify that alice is deleted from all three of the HSMs on the cluster.

Arguments
Because this command does not have named parameters, you must enter the arguments in the order specified in the syntax diagram.
deleteUser <user-type> <user-name>

Specifies the type of user. This parameter is required. 
When you delete a crypto user (CU), all keys that the user owned are deleted, even if the keys were shared with other users. To make accidental or malicious deletion of users less likely, use quorum authentication. 
Valid values are CO, CU, AU, PCO, and PRECO. 
To get the user type, use listUsers. For detailed information about the user types on an HSM, see HSM Users.
Required: Yes

Specifies a friendly name for the user. The maximum length is 31 characters. The only special character permitted is an underscore ( _ ).
You cannot change the name of a user after it is created. In cloudhsm_mgmt_util commands, the user type and password are case-sensitive, but the user name is not.
Required: Yes
