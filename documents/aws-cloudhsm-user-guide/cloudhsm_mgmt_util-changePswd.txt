changePswd
The changePswd command in cloudhsm_mgmt_util changes the password of an existing user on the HSMs in the cluster. 
Any user can change their own password. In addition, Crypto officers (COs and PCOs) can change the password of another CO, crypto user (CU), or application user (AU). You do not need to enter the current password to make the change.
Note
You cannot change the password of a user who is currently logged into the AWS CloudHSM client or key_mgmt_util.
Before you run any cloudhsm_mgmt_util command, you must start cloudhsm_mgmt_util and log in to the HSM. Be sure that you log in with the user account type that can run the commands you plan to use.
If you add or delete HSMs, update the configuration files that the AWS CloudHSM client and the command line tools use. Otherwise, the changes that you make might not be effective for all HSMs in the cluster.
User Type
The following users can run this command.
 Crypto officers (CO)
 Crypto users (CU)
Syntax
Because this command does not have named parameters, you must enter the arguments in the order specified in the syntax diagram.
changePswd <user-type> <user-name> <password>
Examples
The following examples show how to use changePassword to reset the password for the current user or any other user in your HSMs.
Example : Change Your Password
Any user on the HSMs can use changePswd to change their own password. Before you change the password, use info to get information about each of the HSMs in the cluster, including the username and the user type of the logged in user. 
The following output shows that Bob is currently logged in as a crypto user(CU).  
```
        aws-cloudhsm> info server 0

aws-cloudhsm> info server 1

```
To change password, Bob runs changePswd followed with the user type, username, and a new password.  
```
aws-cloudhsm> changePswd CU bob newPassword

Example : Change the Password of Another User
You must be a CO or PCO to change the password of another CO, CU, or AU on the HSMs. Before you change the password for another user, use the info command to confirm that your user type is either CO or PCO.
The following output confirms that Alice, who is a CO, is currently logged in.  
```
aws-cloudhsm>info server 0
Id      Name             Hostname         Port   State           Partition        LoginState

```
 Alice wants to reset the password of another user, John. Before she changes the password, she uses the listUsers command to verify John's user type. 
 The following output lists John as a CO user.   
```
aws-cloudhsm> listUsers

To change the password, Alice runs changePswd followed with John's user type, username, and a new password.  
```
aws-cloudhsm>changePswd CO john newPassword
