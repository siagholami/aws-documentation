deleteKey
The deleteKey command in key_mgmt_util deletes a key from the HSM. You can only delete one key at a time. Deleting one key in a key pair has no effect on the other key in the pair.
Only the key owner can delete a key. Users who share the key can use it in cryptographic operations, but not delete it. 
Before you run any key_mgmt_util command, you must start key_mgmt_util and log in to the HSM as a crypto user (CU). 
Syntax
```
deleteKey -h 
deleteKey -k
```
Examples
These examples show how to use deleteKey to delete keys from your HSMs.
Example : Delete a Key
This command deletes the key with key handle 6. When the command succeeds, deleteKey returns success messages from each HSM in the cluster.  
```
Command: deleteKey -k 6
    Cfm3DeleteKey returned: 0x00 : HSM Return: SUCCESS

    Cluster Error Status
    Node id 1 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS
    Node id 2 and err state 0x00000000 : HSM Return: SUCCESS

```
Example : Delete a Key (Failure)
When the command fails because no key has the specified key handle, deleteKey returns an invalid object handle error message.  
```
Command: deleteKey -k 252126
    Cfm3FindKey returned: 0xa8 : HSM Error: Invalid object handle is passed to this operation

    Cluster Error Status
    Node id 1 and err state 0x000000a8 : HSM Error: Invalid object handle is passed to this operation
    Node id 2 and err state 0x000000a8 : HSM Error: Invalid object handle is passed to this operation

```
When the command fails because the current user is not the owner of the key, the command returns an access denied error.  
```
Command:  deleteKey -k 262152
Cfm3DeleteKey returned: 0xc6 : HSM Error: Key Access is denied.
```
Parameters
-h
Displays command line help for the command. 
Required: Yes
