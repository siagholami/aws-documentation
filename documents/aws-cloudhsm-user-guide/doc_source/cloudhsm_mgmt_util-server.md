# server<a name="cloudhsm_mgmt_util-server"></a>

Normally, when you issue a command in cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util, the command effects all HSMs in the designated cluster \(*global mode\)*\. However, there may be circumstances for which you need to issue commands to a single HSM\. For instance, in the event that automatic synchronization fails, you may need to sync keys and users on an HSM in order to maintain consistency across the cluster\. You can use the server command in the cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util to enter *server mode* and interact directly with a particular HSM instance\.

Upon successful initiation, the `aws-cloudhsm>` command prompt is replaced with the `server>` command prompt\.

In order to exit server mode, use the `exit` command\. Upon successful exit, you will be returned to the cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util command prompt\.

Before you run any cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util command, you must [start cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-getting-started.md#cloudhsm_mgmt_util-start)\.

## User Type<a name="server-userType"></a>

The following users can run this command\.
+ All users\.

## Prerequisites<a name="server-prerequisites"></a>

In order to enter server mode, you must first know the server number of the target HSM\. Server numbers are listed in the trace output generated by cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util upon initiation\. Server numbers are assigned in the same order that the HSMs appear in the configuration file\. For this example, we assume that `server 0` is the server that corresponds to the desired HSM\.

## Syntax<a name="server-syntax"></a>

To start server mode:

```
server <server-number>
```

To exit server mode:

```
server> exit
```

## Example<a name="server-examples"></a>

This command enters server mode on an HSM with server number `0`\.

```
aws-cloudhsm> server 0

Server is in 'E2' mode...
```

In order to exit server mode, use the exit command\.

```
server0> exit
```

## Arguments<a name="server-arguments"></a>

server <server-number>
```

**<server\-number>**  
Specifies the server number of the target HSM\.  
Required: Yes

There are no arguments for the `exit` command\.
