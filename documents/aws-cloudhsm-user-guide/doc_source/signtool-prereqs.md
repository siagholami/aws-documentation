# Microsoft SignTool with AWS CloudHSM Step 1: Set Up the Prerequisites<a name="signtool-prereqs"></a>

To use Microsoft SignTool with AWS CloudHSM, you need the following:
+ An Amazon EC2 client instance running a Windows operating system\.
+ A certificate authority \(CA\), either self\-maintained or established by a third\-party provider\.
+ An active AWS CloudHSM cluster in the same virtual public cloud \(VPC\) as your EC2 instance\. The cluster must contain at least one HSM\.
+ A crypto user \(CU\) to own and manage keys in the AWS CloudHSM cluster\.
+ An unsigned file or executable\.
+ The Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit \(SDK\)\.

**To set up the prerequisites for using AWS CloudHSM with Windows SignTool**

1. Follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) section of this guide to launch a Windows EC2 instance and an AWS CloudHSM cluster\.

1. If you would like to host your own Windows Server CA, follow steps 1 and 2 in [Configuring Windows Server as a Certificate Authority with AWS CloudHSM](win-ca-overview.md)\. Otherwise, continue to use your publically trusted third\-party CA\.

1. Download and install one of the following versions of the Microsoft Windows SDK on your Windows EC2 instance:
   + [Microsoft Windows SDK 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
   + [Microsoft Windows SDK 8\.1](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-8-1-sdk)
   + [Microsoft Windows SDK 7](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279)

   The `SignTool` executable is part of the Windows SDK Signing Tools for Desktop Apps installation feature\. You can omit the other features to be installed if you donâ€™t need them\. The default installation location is:

   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\<SDK version>\bin\<version number>\<CPU architecture>\signtool.exe
   ```

You can now use the Microsoft Windows SDK, your AWS CloudHSM cluster, and your CA to [Create a Signing Certificate](signtool-csr.md)\.
