# Step 2: Create a Certificate Signing Request \(CSR\) and Certificate<a name="ssl-offload-windows-create-csr-and-certificate"></a>

To enable HTTPS, your web server needs an SSL/TLS certificate and a corresponding private key\. To use SSL/TLS offload with AWS CloudHSM, you store the private key in the HSM in your AWS CloudHSM cluster\. To do this, you use the [AWS CloudHSM key storage provider \(KSP\) for Microsoft's Cryptography API: Next Generation \(CNG\)](ksp-library.md) to create a certificate signing request \(CSR\)\. Then you give the CSR to a certificate authority \(CA\), which signs the CSR to produce a certificate\.

## Create a CSR<a name="ssl-offload-windows-create-csr"></a>

Use the AWS CloudHSM KSP on your Windows Server to create a CSR\.

**To create a CSR**

1. If you haven't already done so, connect to your Windows server\. For more information, see [Connect to Your Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-connect-to-instance-windows) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances*\.

1. [Start the AWS CloudHSM client](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-getting-started.md#cloudhsm_mgmt_util-start-cloudhsm-client)\.

1. On your Windows Server, use a text editor to create a certificate request file named `IISCertRequest.inf`\. The following shows the contents of an example `IISCertRequest.inf` file\. For more information about the sections, keys, and values that you can specify in the file, see [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certreq_1#BKMK_New)\. Do not change the `ProviderName` value\.

   ```
   [Version]
   Signature = "$Windows NT$"
   [NewRequest]
   Subject = "CN=example.com,C=US,ST=Washington,L=Seattle,O=ExampleOrg,OU=WebServer"
   HashAlgorithm = SHA256
   KeyAlgorithm = RSA
   KeyLength = 2048
   ProviderName = "Cavium Key Storage Provider"
   KeyUsage = 0xf0
   MachineKeySet = True
   [EnhancedKeyUsageExtension]
   OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1
   ```

1. Use the [Windows certreq command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certreq_1) to create a CSR from the `IISCertRequest.inf` file that you created in the previous step\. The following example saves the CSR to a file named `IISCertRequest.csr`\. If you used a different file name for your certificate request file, replace *IISCertRequest\.inf* with the appropriate file name\. You can optionally replace *IISCertRequest\.csr* with a different file name for your CSR file\.

   ```
   C:\>certreq -new IISCertRequest.inf IISCertRequest.csr
           SDK Version: 2.03
   
   CertReq: Request Created
   ```

   The `IISCertRequest.csr` file contains your CSR\. You need this CSR to get a signed certificate\.

## Get a Signed Certificate and Import It<a name="ssl-offload-windows-create-certificate"></a>

In a production environment, you typically use a certificate authority \(CA\) to create a certificate from a CSR\. A CA is not necessary for a test environment\. If you do use a CA, send the CSR file \(`IISCertRequest.csr`\) to it and use the CA to create a signed SSL/TLS certificate\.

As an alternative to using a CA, you can use a tool like [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) to create a self\-signed certificate\.

**Warning**  
Self\-signed certificates are not trusted by browsers and should not be used in production environments\. They can be used in test environments\.

The following procedures show how to create a self\-signed certificate and use it to sign your web server's CSR\.

**To create a self\-signed certificate**

1. Use the following OpenSSL command to create a private key\. You can optionally replace *SelfSignedCA\.key* with the file name to contain your private key\.

   ```
   openssl genrsa -aes256 -out SelfSignedCA.key 2048
   Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
   ......................................................................+++
   .........................................+++
   e is 65537 (0x10001)
   Enter pass phrase for SelfSignedCA.key:
   Verifying - Enter pass phrase for SelfSignedCA.key:
   ```

1. Use the following OpenSSL command to create a self\-signed certificate using the private key that you created in the previous step\. This is an interactive command\. Read the on\-screen instructions and follow the prompts\. Replace *SelfSignedCA\.key* with the name of the file that contains your private key \(if different\)\. You can optionally replace *SelfSignedCA\.crt* with the file name to contain your self\-signed certificate\.

   ```
   openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key SelfSignedCA.key -out SelfSignedCA.crt
   Enter pass phrase for SelfSignedCA.key:
   You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
   into your certificate request.
   What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
   There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
   For some fields there will be a default value,
   If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
   -----
   Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:
   State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
   Locality Name (eg, city) []:
   Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
   Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
   Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:
   Email Address []:
   ```

**To use your self\-signed certificate to sign your web server's CSR**
+ Use the following OpenSSL command to use your private key and self\-signed certificate to sign the CSR\. Replace the following with the names of the files that contain the corresponding data \(if different\)\.
  + *IISCertRequest\.csr* – The name of the file that contains your web server's CSR
  + *SelfSignedCA\.crt* – The name of the file that contains your self\-signed certificate
  + *SelfSignedCA\.key* – The name of the file that contains your private key
  + *IISCert\.crt* – The name of the file to contain your web server's signed certificate

  ```
  openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in IISCertRequest.csr \
                              -CA SelfSignedCA.crt \
                              -CAkey SelfSignedCA.key \
                              -CAcreateserial \
                              -out IISCert.crt
  Signature ok
  subject=/ST=IIS-HSM/L=IIS-HSM/OU=IIS-HSM/O=IIS-HSM/CN=IIS-HSM/C=IIS-HSM
  Getting CA Private Key
  Enter pass phrase for SelfSignedCA.key:
  ```

After you complete the previous step, you have a signed certificate for your web server \(`IISCert.crt`\) and a self\-signed certificate \(`SelfSignedCA.crt`\)\. When you have these files, go to [Step 3: Configure the Web Server](ssl-offload-configure-web-server-windows.md)\.
