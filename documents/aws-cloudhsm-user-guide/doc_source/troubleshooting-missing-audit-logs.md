# Missing AWS CloudHSM Audit Logs in CloudWatch<a name="troubleshooting-missing-audit-logs"></a>

If you created a cluster before January 20th, 2018, you will need to manually configure a [service\-linked role](service-linked-roles.md) in order to enable the delivery of that cluster's audit logs\. For instructions on how to enable a service\-linked role on an HSM cluster, see [Understanding Service\-Linked Roles](service-linked-roles.md), as well as [Creating a Service\-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#create-service-linked-role) in the IAM User Guide\.
