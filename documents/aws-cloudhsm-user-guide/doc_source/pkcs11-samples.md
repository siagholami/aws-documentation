# Code Samples for AWS CloudHSM Software Library for PKCS\#11<a name="pkcs11-samples"></a>

The PKCS\#11 code samples on GitHub show you how to accomplish basic tasks using the AWS CloudHSM software library for PKCS\#11\. 

## Sample Code Prerequisites<a name="w24aac15b9c22b5"></a>

Before running the samples, perform the following steps to set up your environment:
+ Install and configure the AWS CloudHSM software library for [PKCS\#11](pkcs11-library-install.md) and the [AWS CloudHSM client package](install-and-configure-client-linux.md)\.
+ Set up a valid [HSM user name and password](manage-hsm-users.md)\. Cryptographic user \(CU\) permissions are sufficient for these tasks\. Your application uses these credentials to log in to the HSM in each example\.
