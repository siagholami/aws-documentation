Supported PKCS #11 Attributes
A key object can be a public, private, or secret key. Actions permitted on a key object are specified through attributes. Attributes are defined when the key object is created. When you use CloudHSM's PKCS #11 SDK, we assign default values as specified by the PKCS #11 standard.
Note
CloudHSM does not support all attributes listed in the PKCS #11 specification. We are compliant with the specification for all attributes we support. These attributes are listed in the respective tables.
Cryptographic functions such as C_CreateObject, C_GenerateKey, C_GenerateKeyPair, C_UnwrapKey, and C_DeriveKey that create, modify, or copy objects take an attribute template as one of their parameters. For more information about passing an attribute template during object creation, see Generate keys through PKCS #11 library sample.
Interpreting the PKCS #11 Attributes Table
The PKCS #11 table contains a list of attributes that differ by key types. It indicates whether a given attribute is supported for a particular key type when using a specific cryptographic function with AWS CloudHSM.
Legend:
 ✔ indicates that CloudHSM supports the attribute for the specific key type.
 ✖ indicates that CloudHSM does not support the attribute for the specific key type.
 R indicates that the attribute value is set to read-only for the specific key type .
 S indicates that the attribute cannot be read by the GetAttributeValue as it is sensitive.
 An empty cell in the Default Value column indicates that there is no specific default value assigned to the attribute.

Annotations:
1 This attribute is partially supported by the firmware and must be explicitly set only to the default value.
2 Mandatory attribute.
3 The CKA_SIGN_RECOVER attribute is derived from the CKA_SIGN attribute. If being set, it can only be set to the same value that is set for CKA_SIGN. If not set, it derives the default value of CKA_SIGN. Since CloudHSM only supports RSA-based recoverable signature mechanisms, this attribute is currently applicable to RSA public keys only.
4 The CKA_VERIFY_RECOVER attribute is derived from the CKA_VERIFY attribute. If being set, it can only be set to the same value that is set for CKA_VERIFY. If not set, it derives the default value of CKA_VERIFY. Since CloudHSM only supports RSA-based recoverable signature mechanisms, this attribute is currently applicable to RSA public keys only.
Modifying Attributes
Some attributes of an object can be modified after the object has been created, whereas some cannot. To modify attributes, use the setAttribute command from cloudhsm_mgmt_util. You can also derive a list of attributes and the constants that represent them by using the listAttribute command from cloudhsm_mgmt_util.
The following list displays attributes that are allowed for modification after object creation:
 CKA_LABEL
 CKA_TOKEN
Note
Modification is allowed only for changing a session key to a token key. Use the setAttribute command from key_mgmt_util to change the attribute value.
 CKA_ENCRYPT
 CKA_DECRYPT
 CKA_SIGN
 CKA_VERIFY
 CKA_WRAP
 CKA_UNWRAP
 CKA_LABEL
 CKA_SENSITIVE
 CKA_DERIVE
Note
This attribute supports key derivation. It must be False for all public keys and cannot be set to True. For secret and EC private keys, it can be set to True or False.
 CKA_TRUSTED
Note
This attribute can be set to True or False by Crypto Officer (CO) only.
 CKA_WRAP_WITH_TRUSTED
Note
This attribute can be set to True if the key can only be wrapped with a wrapping key that has CKA_TRUSTED set to True. Modification is allowed for changing the attribute value from False to True. Once set to True, you cannot modify the attribute value. 
Interpreting Error Codes
Specifying in the template an attribute that is not supported by a specific key results in an error. The following table contains error codes that are generated when you violate specifications:
