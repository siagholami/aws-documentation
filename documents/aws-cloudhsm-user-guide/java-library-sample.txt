Sample Code Prerequisites
The Java code samples included in this documentation show you how to use the AWS CloudHSM software library for Java to perform basic tasks in AWS CloudHSM. Before running the samples, perform the following steps to set up your environment:
 Install and configure the AWS CloudHSM software library for Java and the AWS CloudHSM client package. 
 Set up a valid HSM user name and password. Cryptographic user (CU) permissions are sufficient for these tasks. Your application uses these credentials to log in to the HSM in each example.
 Decide how to specify the Cavium provider.
