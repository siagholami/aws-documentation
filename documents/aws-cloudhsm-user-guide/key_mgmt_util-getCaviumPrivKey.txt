getCaviumPrivKey
The getCaviumPrivKey command in key_mgmt_util exports a private key from an HSM in fake PEM format. The fake PEM file, which does not contain the actual private key material but instead references the private key in the HSM, can then be used to establish SSL/TLS offloading from your web server to AWS CloudHSM. For more information, see SSL/TLS Offload on Linux.
Before you run any key_mgmt_util command, you must start key_mgmt_util and login to the HSM as a crypto user (CU).
Syntax
```
getCaviumPrivKey -h
