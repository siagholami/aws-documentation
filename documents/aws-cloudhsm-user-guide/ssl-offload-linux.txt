Tutorial: Using SSL/TLS Offload with AWS CloudHSM on Linux
This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for setting up SSL/TLS offload with AWS CloudHSM on a Linux web server.
Topics
 Overview
 Step 1: Set Up the Prerequisites
 Step 2: Generate or Import a Private Key and SSL/TLS Certificate
 Step 3: Configure the Web Server
 Step 4: Enable HTTPS Traffic and Verify the Certificate
 (Optional) Step 5: Add a Load Balancer with Elastic Load Balancing
Overview
On Linux, the NGINX and Apache HTTP Server web server software integrate with OpenSSL to support HTTPS. The AWS CloudHSM dynamic engine for OpenSSL provides an interface that enables the web server software to use the HSMs in your cluster for cryptographic offloading and key storage. The OpenSSL engine is the bridge that connects the web server to your AWS CloudHSM cluster.
To complete this tutorial, you must first choose whether to use the NGINX or Apache web server software on Linux. Then the tutorial shows you how to do the following:
 Install the web server software on an Amazon EC2 instance.
 Configure the web server software to support HTTPS with a private key stored in your AWS CloudHSM cluster.
 (Optional) Use Amazon EC2 to create a second web server instance and Elastic Load Balancing to create a load balancer. Using a load balancer can increase performance by distributing the load across multiple servers. It can also provide redundancy and higher availability if one or more servers fail.
