Download the latest version (3.0) software for Windows Server:
 AWS CloudHSM for Windows Server

Version 3.0 provides important improvements to operational stability and performance. This is a recommended update due to various bug fixes.
AWS CloudHSM Client Software
 Key_mgmt_util includes the following updates:
   Removed the default mechanism from wrapKey and unwrapKey. You must explicitly provide a mechanism when using these function. 
   Added support for key wrap and unwrap using AES-GCM. To use this wrapping mechanism, specify -m 10 with wrapKey and unwrapKey. For more information, see wrapKey or unwrapKey.
   Changed the name for AES key wrapping using mechanism 4 from CLOUDHSM_AES_KEY_WRAP to AES_KEY_WRAP_PAD_PKCS5, to reflect that AWS CloudHSM utilizes PKCS5 padding while wrapping keys. For more information, see the list of Known Issues. 
   Improved findKey to return keys owned and shared by the CU that is logged in. For more information, see the findKey article.
Cloudhsm_mgmt_util includes the following updates:
   COs can set the OBJ_ATTR_TRUSTED attribute on any key (value 134) in the HSM by using setAttribute to mark a key as trusted. 
Note
OBJ_ATTR_TRUSTED is the only attribute that can be set by a CO. For more information, see the setAttribute command.
   findAllKeys displays keys owned by a CU and shared with that CU. Learn more at findAllKeys.
PKCS #11 Library
 PKCS #11 no longer requires Redis for high performance. Redis is no longer included in the installation packages. If you used Redis in previous installations, update your start-up and installation scripts to remove Redis commands.
 Added support for encryption and decryption using D3DES ECB and AES_CTR. The full list of supported functions and mechanisms in PKCS#11 is available in the Supported PKCS #11 Mechanisms article.
Code samples for des_ecb.c and aes_ctr.c are available on GitHub. 
 Added support for key derivation using HMAC KDF (SP 800-108) which enables you to use the CKM_SP800_108_COUNTER_KDF mechanism with the C_DeriveKey function. For additional information see the code sample hmac-kdf.c.
 Added support for key wrap and unwrap using AES-GCM, through the CKM_CLOUDHSM_AES_GCM mechanism. For more information, see the aes_gcm_wrapping sample on GitHub.
 Added support for the following attributes: CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE, CKA_DERIVE, CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE, CKA_WRAP_WITH_TRUSTED, CKA_TRUSTED, CKA_WRAP_TEMPLATE, CKA_UNWRAP_TEMPLATE, CKA_DESTROYABLE.
The full list of supported attributes is in the Supported PKCS #11 Attributes article. To learn about using trusted keys for controlled wrapping and unwrapping, see the article on using trusted keys.  To see the available samples that work with the newly supported attributes, go to the AWS CloudHSM examples on GitHub,
 Added the mechanism, CKM_CLOUDSHM_AES_GCM, which is a memory-safe AES-GCM implementation. This proprietary mechanism is a safer alternative to the standard CKM_AES_GCM. CKM_CLOUDSHM_AES_GCM prepends the IV generated by the HSM to the ciphertext instead of writing it back into the CK_GCM_PARAMS structure provided during cipher initialization. You can use CKM_CLOUDSHM_AES_GCM with the C_Encrypt or C_WrapKey functions. When using this mechanism, the pIV variable in the CK_GCM_PARAMS struct must be set to NULL. See the CKM_CLOUDHSM_AES_GCM entry in the table in the  Supported PCKS#11-Mechanisms article.
OpenSSL Dynamic Engine
 Updated the version for consistency.
Java Library
 Added the CloudHSM keystore which supports certificates, allowing interoperability with third party tools like keytool and jarsigner. To learn how to use this keystore, see the CloudHSM Key Store article, or the  CloudHSMKeyStoreExampleRunner sample on GitHub. To use the keystore with KeyTool and Jarsigner, refer to the  CloudHSM KeyStore Integration guide. 
 Added support for encryption and decryption using D3DES ECB and AES_CTR. The full list of supported functions in JDE is available in the Supported Mechanisms article. You can find sample code for the  DESedeECMEncryptDecryptRunner sample and  AESCTREncryptDecryptRunner sample on GitHub.
 Added support for key wrap and unwrap using AES-GCM. See the AESGCMWrappingRunner sample on GitHub.
 Added support for ECDH. The derivation is partially executed on the HSM. For additional information, see the list of Known Issues for the JCE SDK before using ECDH with CloudHSM. To learn how to use ECDH with the JCE, see the ECDHOperationsRunner sample on GitHub.
 Trusted key wrapping and key derivation are not yet available through the JCE.
Windows (CNG, KSP)
 Updated the version for consistency. 
 Added import_key.exe to associate pre-existing CloudHSM keys with corresponding certificates.

  AWS CloudHSM Client for Windows Server

Significant changes in this version include:
AWS CloudHSM Client Software
 Improved stability and bug fixes.
 In cloud_hsm_mgmt_util, enable_e2e now set by default.
 SECURITY FIX: in key_mgmt_util, resolved issue with the incorrect PKCS#1v1.5 signature parsing. This eliminates potential errors when validating signatures with imported RSA keys that use a public exponent of 3. CloudHSM does not allow generating RSA keys with exponents smaller than 65537 to meet FIPS 140-2 requirements.
PKCS #11 Library
 Improved stability and bug fixes.
 SECURITY FIX: Resolved issue with incorrect PKCS#1v1.5 signature parsing. This eliminates potential errors when validating signatures with imported RSA keys that use a public exponent of 3. CloudHSM does not allow generating RSA keys with exponents smaller than 65537 to meet FIPS 140-2 requirements.
 BREAKING CHANGE: To protect against user error, AES-GCM initialization now requires the user supplied IV buffer to be zeroized. NIST requires the IV for AES-GCM to be generated by the HSM and noted by the application after encryption is complete, as described here. IV is always 12 bytes long.
 Added support for CKM_RSA_PKCS_KEY_PAIR_GEN mechanism.
 Added software hashing of buffers larger than 16KB for digest, sign and verify operations. Hashes of buffers less than 16KB continue to be offloaded to the HSM as before.
 BREAKING CHANGE: Strengthened PKCS#11 compliance, including explicit failure when handling unsupported or inconsistent attributes. If your application was not strictly PKCS#11 compliant before, you may experience errors or failures after updating to this version. Specifically:
   If an application is already logged in, logging in will now return the error CKR_USER_ALREADY_LOGGED_IN.
   CKA_KEY_GEN_MECHANISM will cause an error if included in a C_CreateObject call.
   CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE, CKA_LOCAL and CKA_NEVER_EXTRACTABLE will cause errors if included in a key generation or import template.
   CKA_VALUE_LEN is now validated.
   By default, new keys are scoped as session keys rather than token keys, to comply with PKCS#11.
