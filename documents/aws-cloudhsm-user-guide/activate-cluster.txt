Activate the Cluster
When you activate an AWS CloudHSM cluster, the cluster's state changes from initialized to active. You can then manage the HSM's users and use the HSM. 
To activate the cluster, log in to the HSM with the credentials of the precrypto officer (PRECO). This a temporary user that exists only on the first HSM in an AWS CloudHSM cluster. The first HSM in a new cluster contains a PRECO user with a default user name and password. When you change the password, the PRECO user becomes a crypto officer (CO).
To activate a cluster


Connect to the client instance that you launched in previously. For more information, see Launch an Amazon EC2 Client Instance. You can launch a Linux instance or a Windows Server. 


Use the following command to start the cloudhsm_mgmt_util command line utility.
Note
If you are using an AMI that uses Amazon Linux 2, see Known Issues for Amazon EC2 Instances Running Amazon Linux 2.



[ Amazon Linux ]
$ /opt/cloudhsm/bin/cloudhsm_mgmt_util /opt/cloudhsm/etc/cloudhsm_mgmt_util.cfg

[ Ubuntu ]
$ /opt/cloudhsm/bin/cloudhsm_mgmt_util /opt/cloudhsm/etc/cloudhsm_mgmt_util.cfg

[ Windows ]
C:\Program Files\Amazon\CloudhSM>cloudhsm_mgmt_util.exe C:\ProgramData\Amazon\CloudHSM\data\cloudhsm_mgmt_util.cfg


Use the enable_e2e command to enable end-to-end encryption.

```
   aws-cloudhsm>enable_e2e
E2E enabled on server 0(server1)
   ```

(Optional) Use the listUsers command to display the existing users.

```
   aws-cloudhsm>listUsers
   Users on server 0(server1):
   Number of users found:2
   User Id             User Type       User Name                          MofnPubKey    LoginFailureCnt         2FA
        1              PRECO           admin                                    NO               0               NO
        2              AU              app_user                                 NO               0               NO

```

Use the loginHSM command to log in to the HSM as the PRECO user. This is a temporary user that exists on the first HSM in your cluster. 

```
   aws-cloudhsm>loginHSM PRECO admin password
loginHSM success on server 0(server1)
   ```

Use the changePswd command to change the password for the PRECO user. When you change the password, the PRECO user becomes a crypto officer (CO). 

```
   aws-cloudhsm>changePswd PRECO admin 
****CAUTION****
   This is a CRITICAL operation, should be done on all nodes in the
   cluster. Cav server does NOT synchronize these changes with the
   nodes on which this operation is not executed or failed, please
   ensure this operation is executed on all nodes in the cluster.
   *********
Do you want to continue(y/n)?y
   Changing password for admin(PRECO) on 1 nodes
   ```
We recommend that you write down the new password on a password worksheet. Do not lose the worksheet. We recommend that you print a copy of the password worksheet, use it to record your critical HSM passwords, and then store it in a secure place. We also recommended that you store a copy of this worksheet in secure off-site storage. 

(Optional) Use the listUsers command to verify that the user's type changed to crypto officer (CO). 

```
   aws-cloudhsm>listUsers
   Users on server 0(server1):
   Number of users found:2
   User Id             User Type       User Name                          MofnPubKey    LoginFailureCnt         2FA
        1              CO              admin                                    NO               0               NO
        2              AU              app_user                                 NO               0               NO

```

Use the quit command to stop the cloudhsm_mgmt_util tool.

aws-cloudhsm>quit
