# Monitor the Import Status<a name="monitor-status"></a>

To monitor the status of your import job in the console, sign in to the [AWS Snowball Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/importexport/home?region=us-west-2)\. Choose the job you want to track from the table, or search for it by your chosen parameters in the search bar above the table\. Once you select the job, detailed information appears for that job within the table, including a bar that shows real\-time status of your job\.

Once your device arrives at AWS, your job status changes from **In transit to AWS** to **At AWS**\. On average, it takes a day for your data import into Amazon S3 to begin\. When it does, the status of your job changes to **Importing**\. From this point on, it takes an average of two business days for your import to reach **Completed** status\.

Now your first data import job into Amazon S3 using AWS Snowball is complete\. You can get a report about the data transfer from the console\. To access this report from the console, select the job from the table, and expand it to reveal the job's detailed information\. Choose **Get report** to download your job completion report as a PDF file\. For more information, see [Get Your Job Completion Report and Logs in the Console](report.md)\.
