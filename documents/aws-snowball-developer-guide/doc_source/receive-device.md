# Receive the Snowball Edge<a name="receive-device"></a>

When you receive the AWS Snowball Edge device, you'll notice that it doesn't come in a box\. The device is its own physically rugged shipping container\. When the device first arrives, inspect it for damage or obvious tampering\. If you notice anything that looks suspicious about the device, don't connect it to your internal network\. Instead, contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/) and inform them of the issue so that a new device can be shipped to you\.

**Important**  
The AWS Snowball Edge device is the property of AWS\. Tampering with an AWS Snowball Edge device is a violation of the AWS Acceptable Use Policy\. For more information, see [http://aws\.amazon\.com/aup/](http://aws.amazon.com/aup/)\.
