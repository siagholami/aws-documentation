# Stop the Snowball Client, and Power Off the Snowball Edge<a name="turnitoff"></a>

When you've finished transferring data on to the AWS Snowball Edge device, prepare it for its return trip to AWS\. Before you continue, make sure that all data transfer to the device has stopped\. If you were using the file interface to transfer data, you need to disable it before you power off the device\. For more information, see [Disabling the File Interface](using-fileinterface.md#fileinterface-cleanup)\.

When all communication with the device has ended, simply turn it off by pressing the power button above the LCD display\. It takes about 20 seconds for the device to shut down\.
