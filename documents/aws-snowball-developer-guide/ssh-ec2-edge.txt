Connecting to Your Compute Instance on a Snowball Edge Using SSH
To use SSH to connect to your compute instances on Snowball Edge devices, you must first provide the SSH key to the AMI before creating your job. For more information on that procedure, see Configure an AMI to Use SSH to Connect to Compute Instances Launched on the Device. If you haven't followed that procedure, you can't use SSH to connect to your instances.
To connect to your instance with SSH


Make sure that your device is powered on, connected to network, and unlocked. For more information, see Connect to Your Local Network.


Make sure that you have your network settings configured for your compute instances. For more information, see Network Configuration for Compute Instances.


Check your notes to find the PEM or PPK key pair that you used for this specific instance. Make a copy of those files somewhere on your computer. Make a note of the path to the PEM file.


Connect to your instance through SSH as in the following example command. The IP address is the IP address of the virtual network interface (VNIC) that you set up in Network Configuration for Compute Instances.


ssh -i path/to/PEM/key/file instance-user-name@192.0.2.0
