This guide is for the Snowball Edge. If you are looking for documentation for the Snowball, see the AWS Snowball User Guide.

Using the Snowball Client
Following, you can find information about how to get and use the Snowball client with your AWS Snowball Edge device. The Snowball client is a standalone terminal application that you run on your local server to unlock the device and get credentials, logs, and status information. You can also use the client for administrative tasks for a cluster. While using the Snowball client, you can get additional support information by running the snowballEdge help command.
When you read and write data to the AWS Snowball Edge device, you use the Amazon S3 Adapter for Snowball or the file interface.
Note
In January 2018, there was a feature update for clusters, making them leaderless. The cluster update is backward-compatible with older clusters. However, if you're looking for documentation for the original Snowball client for Snowball Edge, see Using the Snowball Client.
Downloading and Installing the Snowball Client
You can download and install the Snowball client from the AWS Snowball resources website.
You can download and install the Snowball client from the AWS Snowball Edge Resources page. On that page, you can find the installation package for your operating system and follow the instructions to install the Snowball client. Running the Snowball client from a terminal in your workstation might require using a specific path, depending on your operating system:
 Microsoft Windows – When the client has been installed, you can run it from any directory without any additional preparation.
 Linux – The Snowball client must be run from the \~/snowball-client-linux-build_number/bin/ directory. Note that the Snowball client is only supported on 64-bit Linux distributions.
 MacOS – The install.sh script copies folders from the Snowball client .tar file to the /usr/local/bin/snowball directory. If you run this script, you can then run the Snowball client from any directory if /usr/local/bin is a path in your bash_profile. You can verify your path with the echo $PATH command.
