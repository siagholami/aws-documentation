This guide is for the Snowball Edge. If you are looking for documentation for the Snowball, see the AWS Snowball User Guide.

Network Configuration for Compute Instances
After youâ€™ve launched your compute instances on a Snowball Edge device, you need to set up your network configuration for each instance. Use the following procedure whenever you launch a new instance to give that instance a virtual network interface and IP address.


Make sure there's power to your device and that one of your physical network interfaces, like the RJ45 port, are connected with an IP address.


Get the IP address associated with the physical network interface that you're using on the Snowball Edge. For more information, see Connect to Your Local Network.


Configure your Snowball client. For more information, see Configuring a Profile for the Snowball Client.


Unlock the device. For more information, see Unlocking Snowball Edge Devices.


Run the snowballEdge describe-device command to get the list of physical network interface IDs.


Identify the ID for the physical network interface that you want to use, and make a note of it.


Run the snowballEdge create-virtual-network-interface command. The following examples show running this command with the two different IP address assignment methods, either DHCP or STATIC. The DHCP method uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).


```
   snowballEdge create-virtual-network-interface \
   --physical-network-interface-id s.ni-abcd1234 \
   --ip-address-assignment DHCP
       //OR//

snowballEdge create-virtual-network-interface \
   --physical-network-interface-id s.ni-abcd1234 \
   --ip-address-assignment STATIC \
   --static-ip-address-configuration IpAddress=192.0.2.0,Netmask=255.255.255.0
   ```
The command returns a JSON structure that includes the IP address. Make a note of that IP address for the ec2 associate-address AWS CLI command later in the process.
Anytime you need this IP address, you can use the snowballEdge describe-virtual-network-interfaces Snowball client command, or the aws ec2 describe-addresses AWS CLI command to get it.


To deploy the Amazon EC2 instance on your Snowball Edge using the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that you chose when you created your job, run these AWS CLI commands, replacing the red text with your own values: 


To describe the AMI, run this command, replacing the red text with your Snowball Edge IP address: 
aws ec2 describe-images --endpoint http://Snowball Edge physical IP address:8008
After you run this command, the output provides image details about the AMI. In this example, the image details for the AMI are s.ami-12345678. Your AMI image details will be different. 


To deploy the EC2 intsance from the AMI described in the previous step, run the command shown below, replacing the red text with your values:
aws ec2 run-instance --image-id s.ami-12345678 --instance-type sbe-c.large  --endpoint http://Snowball Edge physical IP address:8008


To confirm the instance ID, run this command, replacing the red text with your Snowball Edge IP address:
aws ec2 describe-instances --endpoint http:// Snowball Edge physical IP address:8008


To describe the instance details, run this command, replacing your own intsance ID and Snowball Edge IP address.
Note
s.i-01234567890123456 is an example instance ID. Your instance ID will be different.
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-id s.i-01234567890123456 --endpoint http://Snowball Edge physical IP address:8008


To associate your newly created IP address with the instance, use the following command, replacing the red text with your values:


aws ec2 associate-address --public-ip 192.0.2.0 --instance-id s.i-01234567890123456 --endpoint Snowball Edge physical IP address:8008
