Launching an instance from a launch template
You can create a launch template that contains the configuration information to launch an instance. Launch templates enable you to store launch parameters so that you do not have to specify them every time you launch an instance. For example, a launch template can contain the AMI ID, instance type, and network settings that you typically use to launch instances. When you launch an instance using the Amazon EC2 console, an AWS SDK, or a command line tool, you can specify the launch template to use.
For each launch template, you can create one or more numbered launch template versions. Each version can have different launch parameters. When you launch an instance from a launch template, you can use any version of the launch template. If you do not specify a version, the default version is used. You can set any version of the launch template as the default versionâ€”by default, it's the first version of the launch template.
The following diagram shows a launch template with three versions. The first version specifies the instance type, AMI ID, subnet, and key pair to use to launch the instance. The second version is based on the first version and also specifies a security group for the instance. The third version uses different values for some of the parameters. Version 2 is set as the default version. If you launched an instance from this launch template, the launch parameters from version 2 would be used if no other version were specified.

Launch template restrictions
The following rules apply to launch templates and launch template versions:
 You are limited to creating 5,000 launch templates per Region and 10,000 versions per launch template.
 Launch template parameters are optional. However, you must ensure that your request to launch an instance includes all required parameters. For example, if your launch template does not include an AMI ID, you must specify both the launch template and an AMI ID when you launch an instance.
 Launch template parameters are not fully validated when you create the launch template. If you specify incorrect values for parameters, or if you do not use supported parameter combinations, no instances can launch using this launch template. Ensure that you specify the correct values for the parameters and that you use supported parameter combinations. For example, to launch an instance in a placement group, you must specify a supported instance type.
 You can tag a launch template, but you cannot tag a launch template version.
 Launch template versions are numbered in the order in which they are created. When you create a launch template version, you cannot specify the version number yourself.
Using launch templates to control launch parameters
A launch template can contain all or some of the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using a launch template, you can override parameters that are specified in the launch template. Or, you can specify additional parameters that are not in the launch template.
Note
You cannot remove launch template parameters during launch (for example, you cannot specify a null value for the parameter). To remove a parameter, create a new version of the launch template without the parameter and use that version to launch the instance.
To launch instances, IAM users must have permissions to use the ec2:RunInstances action. You must also have permissions to create or use the resources that are created or associated with the instance. You can use resource-level permissions for the ec2:RunInstances action to control the launch parameters that users can specify. Alternatively, you can grant users permissions to launch an instance using a launch template. This enables you to manage launch parameters in a launch template rather than in an IAM policy, and to use a launch template as an authorization vehicle for launching instances. For example, you can specify that users can only launch instances using a launch template, and that they can only use a specific launch template. You can also control the launch parameters that users can override in the launch template. For example policies, see Launch templates.
Controlling the use of launch templates
By default, IAM users do not have permissions to work with launch templates. You can create an IAM user policy that grants users permissions to create, modify, describe, and delete launch templates and launch template versions. You can also apply resource-level permissions to some launch template actions to control a user's ability to use specific resources for those actions. For more information, see the following example policies: Example: Working with launch templates.
Take care when granting users permissions to use the ec2:CreateLaunchTemplate and ec2:CreateLaunchTemplateVersion actions. You cannot use resource-level permissions to control which resources users can specify in the launch template. To restrict the resources that are used to launch an instance, ensure that you grant permissions to create launch templates and launch template versions only to appropriate administrators.
Creating a launch template
Create a new launch template using parameters that you define, or use an existing launch template or an instance as the basis for a new launch template.

[ AWS CLI ]
To create a launch template using the AWS CLI
 Use the create-launch-template command. The following example creates a launch template that specifies the following:
   A tag for the launch template (purpose=production)
   The instance type (r4.4xlarge) and AMI (ami-8c1be5f6) to launch
   The number of cores (4) and threads per core (2) for a total of 8 vCPUs (4 cores x 2 threads)
   The subnet in which to launch the instance (subnet-7b16de0c)
The template assigns a public IP address and an IPv6 address to the instance and creates a tag for the instance(Name=webserver).
aws ec2 create-launch-template \
      --launch-template-name TemplateForWebServer \
      --version-description WebVersion1 \
      --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=launch-template,Tags=[{Key=purpose,Value=production}]' \
      --launch-template-data file://template-data.json
The following is an example template-data.json file.
{
      "NetworkInterfaces": [{
          "AssociatePublicIpAddress": true,
          "DeviceIndex": 0,

Launching an instance from a launch template
You can use the parameters contained in a launch template to launch an instance. You have the option to override or add launch parameters before you launch the instance.
Instances that are launched using a launch template are automatically assigned two tags with the keys aws:ec2launchtemplate:id and aws:ec2launchtemplate:version. You cannot remove or edit these tags.

[ New console ]
To launch an instance from a launch template using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

[ AWS CLI ]
To launch an instance from a launch template using the AWS CLI
 Use the run-instances command and specify the --launch-template parameter. Optionally specify the launch template version to use. If you don't specify the version, the default version is used.
aws ec2 run-instances \
      --launch-template LaunchTemplateId=lt-0abcd290751193123,Version=1
 To override a launch template parameter, specify the parameter in the run-instances command. The following example overrides the instance type that's specified in the launch template (if any).
aws ec2 run-instances \
      --launch-template LaunchTemplateId=lt-0abcd290751193123 \
      --instance-type t2.small
 If you specify a nested parameter that's part of a complex structure, the instance is launched using the complex structure as specified in the launch template plus any additional nested parameters that you specify.
In the following example, the instance is launched with the tag Owner=TeamA as well as any other tags that are specified in the launch template. If the launch template has an existing tag with a key of Owner, the value is replaced with TeamA.
aws ec2 run-instances \
      --launch-template LaunchTemplateId=lt-0abcd290751193123 \
      --tag-specifications "ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Owner,Value=TeamA}]"
In the following example, the instance is launched with a volume with the device name /dev/xvdb as well as any other block device mappings that are specified in the launch template. If the launch template has an existing volume defined for /dev/xvdb, its values are replaced with the specified values.
aws ec2 run-instances \
      --launch-template LaunchTemplateId=lt-0abcd290751193123 \
      --block-device-mappings "DeviceName=/dev/xvdb,Ebs={VolumeSize=20,VolumeType=gp2}"
If the instance fails to launch or the state immediately goes to terminated instead of running, see Troubleshooting instance launch issues.

Using launch templates with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
You can create an Auto Scaling group and specify a launch template to use for the group. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances in the Auto Scaling group, it uses the launch parameters defined in the associated launch template. For more information, see Creating an Auto Scaling Group Using a Launch Template in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
Before you can create an Auto Scaling group using a launch template, you must create a launch template that includes the parameters required to launch an instance in an Auto Scaling group, such as the ID of the AMI. The new console provides guidance to help you create a template that you can use with Auto Scaling.
To create a launch template to use with Auto Scaling using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Launch Templates, and then choose Create launch template.


For Launch template name, enter a descriptive name for the launch template.


For Template version description, provide a brief description of the launch template version.


Under Auto Scaling guidance, select the checkbox to have Amazon EC2 provide guidance to help create a template to use with Auto Scaling.


Modify the launch parameters as required. Because you selected Auto Scaling guidance, some fields are required and some fields are not available. For considerations to keep in mind when creating a launch template, and for information about how to configure the launch parameters for Auto Scaling, see Creating a Launch Template for an Auto Scaling Group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.


Choose Create launch template.


(Optional) To create an Auto Scaling group using this launch template, in the Next steps page, choose Create Auto Scaling group.


To create or update an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with a launch template using the AWS CLI
 Use the create-auto-scaling-group or the update-auto-scaling-group command and specify the --launch-template parameter.
