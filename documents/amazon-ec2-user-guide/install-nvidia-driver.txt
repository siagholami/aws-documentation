Installing NVIDIA drivers on Linux instances
An instance with an attached GPU, such as a P3 or G4 instance, must have the appropriate NVIDIA driver installed. Depending on the instance type, you can either download a public NVIDIA driver, download a driver from Amazon S3 that is available only to AWS customers, or use an AMI with the driver pre-installed.

Types of NVIDIA drivers
The following are the main types of NVIDIA drivers that can be used with GPU-based instances.
Tesla drivers
These drivers are intended primarily for compute workloads, which use GPUs for computational tasks such as parallelized floating-point calculations for machine learning and fast Fourier transforms for high performance computing applications.
GRID drivers
These drivers are certified to provide optimal performance for professional visualization applications that render content such as 3D models or high-resolution videos. You can configure GRID drivers to support two modes. Quadro Virtual Workstations provide access to four 4K displays per GPU. GRID vApps provide RDSH App hosting capabilities.
Gaming drivers
These drivers contain optimizations for gaming and are updated frequently to provide performance enhancements. They support a single 4K display per GPU.
NVIDIA control panel
The NVIDIA control panel is supported with GRID and Gaming drivers. It is not supported with Tesla drivers.
Supported APIs for Tesla, GRID, and gaming drivers
 OpenCL, OpenGL, and Vulkan
 NVIDIA CUDA and related libraries (for example, cuDNN, TensorRT, nvJPEG, and cuBLAS)
 NVENC for video encoding and NVDEC for video decoding
Available drivers by instance type
The following table summarizes the supported NVIDIA drivers for each GPU instance type.

Installation options
Use one of the following options to get the NVIDIA drivers required for your GPU instance.
Topics
 Option 1: AMIs with the NVIDIA drivers installed
 Option 2: Public NVIDIA drivers
 Option 3: GRID drivers (G3 and G4 instances)
 Option 4: NVIDIA gaming drivers (G4 instances)
Option 1: AMIs with the NVIDIA drivers installed
AWS and NVIDIA offer different Amazon Machine Images (AMI) that come with the NVIDIA drivers installed.
 Marketplace offerings with the Tesla driver
 Marketplace offerings with the GRID driver
 Marketplace offerings with the Gaming driver
To update the driver version installed using one of these AMIs, you must uninstall the NVIDIA packages from your instance to avoid version conflicts. Use this command to uninstall the NVIDIA packages:
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum erase nvidia cuda
The CUDA toolkit package has dependencies on the NVIDIA drivers. Uninstalling the NVIDIA packages erases the CUDA toolkit. You must reinstall the CUDA toolkit after installing the NVIDIA driver.
Option 2: Public NVIDIA drivers
The options offered by AWS come with the necessary license for the driver. Alternatively, you can install the public drivers and bring your own license. To install a public driver, download it from the NVIDIA site as described here.
Alternatively, you can use the options offered by AWS instead of the public drivers. To use a GRID driver on a P3 instance, use the AWS Marketplace AMIs as described in Option 1. To use a GRID driver on a G3 or G4 instance, use the AWS Marketplace AMIs, as described in Option 1 or install the NVIDIA drivers provided by AWS as described in Option 3.
To download a public NVIDIA driver
Log on to your Linux instance and download the 64-bit NVIDIA driver appropriate for the instance type from http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx. For Product Type, Product Series, and Product, use the options in the following table.
