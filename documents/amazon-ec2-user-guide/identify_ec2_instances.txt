Identify EC2 Linux instances
Your application might need to determine whether it is running on an EC2 instance.
For information about identifying Windows instances, see Identify EC2 Windows Instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances.
Inspecting the instance identity document
For a definitive and cryptographically verified method of identifying an EC2 instance, check the instance identity document, including its signature. These documents are available on every EC2 instance at the local, non-routable address http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/. For more information, see Instance identity documents.
Inspecting the system UUID
You can get the system UUID and look for the presence of the characters "ec2" or "EC2" in the beginning octet of the UUID. This method to determine whether a system is an EC2 instance is quick but potentially inaccurate because there is a small chance that a system that is not an EC2 instance could have a UUID that starts with these characters. Furthermore, for EC2 instances that are not using Amazon Linux, the distribution's implementation of SMBIOS might represent the UUID in little-endian format, therefore the "EC2" characters do not appear at the beginning of the UUID.
Example : Get the UUID from the hypervisor
If /sys/hypervisor/uuid exists, you can use the following command:  
[ec2-user ~]$ cat /sys/hypervisor/uuid
In the following example output, the UUID starts with "ec2", which indicates that the system is probably an EC2 instance.  
ec2e1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef
Example : Get the UUID from DMI (HVM instances only)
On HVM instances only, you can use the Desktop Management Interface (DMI). 
You can use the dmidecode tool to return the UUID. On Amazon Linux, use the following command to install the dmidecode tool if it's not already installed on your instance:  
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum install dmidecode -y
Then run the following command:  
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo dmidecode --string system-uuid
Alternatively, use the following command:  
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_uuid
In the following example output, the UUID starts with "EC2", which indicates that the system is probably an EC2 instance.  
EC2E1916-9099-7CAF-FD21-01234ABCDEF
In the following example output, the UUID is represented in little-endian format.  
45E12AEC-DCD1-B213-94ED-01234ABCDEF
On Nitro instances, the following command can be used:  
[ec2-user ~]$ cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_asset_tag
This returns the instance ID, which is unique to EC2 instances:  
i-0af01c0123456789a
