Using the base64-encoded signature to verify the instance identity document
This topic explains how to verify the instance identity document using the base64-encoded signature and the AWS RSA public certificate.
Important
To validate the instance identity document using the base64-encoded signature, you must request the AWS RSA public certificate from AWS Support. 
To validate the instance identity document using the base64-encoded signature and the AWS RSA public certificate


Connect to the instance.


Retrieve the base64-encoded signature from the instance metadata, convert it to binary, and add it to a file named signature. Use one of the following commands depending on the IMDS version used by the instance.



[ IMDSv2 ]
$ TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"` \ && curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/signature | base64 -d > signature

[ IMDSv1 ]
$ curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/signature | base64 -d > signature


Retrieve the plaintext instance identity document from the instance metadata and add it to a file named document. Use one of the following commands depending on the IMDS version used by the instance.


[ IMDSv2 ]
$ TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"` \ && curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document > document

[ IMDSv1 ]
$ curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document > document



Add the AWS RSA public certificate that you received from AWS Support to a file named certificate.


Extract the public key from the certificate that you received from AWS Support and save it to a file named key.


$ openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in certificate > key

Use OpenSSL dgst command to verify the instance identity document.

$ openssl dgst -sha256 -verify key -signature signature document
If the signature is valid, the Verified OK message appears. If the signature cannot be verified, contact AWS Support.
