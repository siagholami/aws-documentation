Resource locations
Some resources can be used in all regions (global), and some resources are specific to the region or Availability Zone in which they reside. 



Resource
Type
Description




AWS account
Global
You can use the same AWS account in all regions.


Key pairs
Global or Regional
The key pairs that you create using Amazon EC2 are tied to the Region where you created them. You can create your own RSA key pair and upload it to the region in which you want to use it; therefore, you can make your key pair globally available by uploading it to each Region. For more information, see Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances.


Amazon EC2 resource identifiers
Regional
Each resource identifier, such as an AMI ID, instance ID, EBS volume ID, or EBS snapshot ID, is tied to its Region and can be used only in the Region where you created the resource.


User-supplied resource names
Regional
Each resource name, such as a security group name or key pair name, is tied to its region and can be used only in the Region where you created the resource. Although you can create resources with the same name in multiple regions, they aren't related to each other.


AMIs
Regional
An AMI is tied to the Region where its files are located within Amazon S3. You can copy an AMI from one Region to another. For more information, see Copying an AMI.


Elastic IP addresses
Regional
An Elastic IP address is tied to a Region and can be associated only with an instance in the same Region.


Security groups
Regional
A security group is tied to a Region and can be assigned only to instances in the same Region. You can't enable an instance to communicate with an instance outside its Region using security group rules. Traffic from an instance in another Region is seen as WAN bandwidth.


EBS snapshots
Regional
An EBS snapshot is tied to its Region and can only be used to create volumes in the same Region. You can copy a snapshot from one Region to another. For more information, see Copying an Amazon EBS snapshot.


EBS volumes
Availability Zone
An Amazon EBS volume is tied to its Availability Zone and can be attached only to instances in the same Availability Zone.


Instances
Availability Zone
An instance is tied to the Availability Zones in which you launched it. However, its instance ID is tied to the Region.
