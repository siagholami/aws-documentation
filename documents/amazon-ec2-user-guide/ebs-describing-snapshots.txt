If you do not specify the owner, the results include all public snapshots.  
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --filters Name=owner-id,Values=123456789012 --query "Snapshots[?(StartTime<=`2020-03-31`)].[SnapshotId]" --output text
The following command displays the IDs of all snapshots created in the specified date range.  
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --filters Name=owner-id,Values=123456789012 --query "Snapshots[?(StartTime>=`2019-01-01`) && (StartTime<=`2019-12-31`)].[SnapshotId]" --output text
