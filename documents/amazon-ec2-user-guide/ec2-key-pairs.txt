Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances
A key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key, is a set of security credentials that you use to prove your identity when connecting to an instance. Amazon EC2 stores the public key, and you store the private key. You use the private key, instead of a password, to securely access your instances. Anyone who possesses your private keys can connect to your instances, so it's important that you store your private keys in a secure place.
When you launch an instance, you are prompted for a key pair. If you plan to connect to the instance using SSH, you must specify a key pair. You can choose an existing key pair or create a new one. When your instance boots for the first time, the content of the public key that you specified at launch is placed on your Linux instance in an entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. When you connect to your Linux instance using SSH, to log in you must specify the private key that corresponds to the public key content. For more information about connecting to your instance, see Connect to your Linux instance. For more information about key pairs and Windows instances, see Amazon EC2 key pairs and Windows instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances
Because Amazon EC2 doesn't keep a copy of your private key, there is no way to recover a private key if you lose it. However, there can still be a way to connect to instances for which you've lost the private key. For more information, see Connecting to your Linux instance if you lose your private key.
The keys that Amazon EC2 uses are 2048-bit SSH-2 RSA keys. You can have up to 5,000 key pairs per Region.

Option 1: Create a key pair using Amazon EC2
You can create a key pair using one of the following methods. 

[ New console ]
To create your key pair


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, under NETWORK & SECURITY, choose Key Pairs.


Choose Create key pair.


For Name, enter a descriptive name for the key pair. Amazon EC2 associates the public key with the name that you specify as the key name. A key name can include up to 255 ASCII characters. It can’t include leading or trailing spaces.


For File format, choose the format in which to save the private key. To save the private key in a format that can be used with OpenSSH, choose pem. To save the private key in a format that can be used with PuTTY, choose ppk.


Choose Create key pair.


The private key file is automatically downloaded by your browser. The base file name is the name you specified as the name of your key pair, and the file name extension is determined by the file format you chose. Save the private key file in a safe place.
Important
This is the only chance for you to save the private key file.


If you will use an SSH client on a macOS or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it.


chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem
If you do not set these permissions, then you cannot connect to your instance using this key pair. For more information, see Error: Unprotected private key file.

[ Old console ]
To create your key pair


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, under NETWORK & SECURITY, choose Key Pairs.


Choose Create Key Pair.


For Key pair name, enter a descriptive name for the key pair, and then choose Create. A key name can include up to 255 ASCII characters. It can’t include leading or trailing spaces.


The private key file is automatically downloaded by your browser. The base file name is the name you specified as the name of your key pair, and the file name extension is .pem. Save the private key file in a safe place.
Important
This is the only chance for you to save the private key file.


If you will use an SSH client on a macOS or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it.


chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem
If you do not set these permissions, then you cannot connect to your instance using this key pair. For more information, see Error: Unprotected private key file.

[ AWS CLI ]
To create your key pair

Use the create-key-pair AWS CLI command as follows to generate the key and save it to a .pem file.

aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name my-key-pair --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > my-key-pair.pem

If you will use an SSH client on a macOS or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it.

chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem
If you do not set these permissions, then you cannot connect to your instance using this key pair. For more information, see Error: Unprotected private key file.

[ PowerShell ]
To create your key pair
Use the New-EC2KeyPair AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell command as follows to generate the key and save it to a .pem file.
PS C:\> (New-EC2KeyPair -KeyName "my-key-pair").KeyMaterial | Out-File -Encoding ascii -FilePath C:\path\my-key-pair.pem

Option 2: Import your own public key to Amazon EC2
Instead of using Amazon EC2 to create your key pair, you can create an RSA key pair using a third-party tool and then import the public key to Amazon EC2. For example, you can use ssh-keygen (a tool provided with the standard OpenSSH installation) to create a key pair. Alternatively, Java, Ruby, Python, and many other programming languages provide standard libraries that you can use to create an RSA key pair.
Requirements
 
The following formats are supported:
   OpenSSH public key format (the format in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys). If you connect using SSH while using the EC2 Instance Connect API, the SSH2 format is also supported.
   Base64 encoded DER format
   SSH public key file format as specified in RFC4716
   SSH private key file format must be PEM (for example, use ssh-keygen -m PEM to convert the OpenSSH key into the PEM format)
 Create an RSA key. Amazon EC2 does not accept DSA keys.
 The supported lengths are 1024, 2048, and 4096. If you connect using SSH while using the EC2 Instance Connect API, the supported lengths are 2048 and 4096.
To create a key pair using a third-party tool


Generate a key pair with a third-party tool of your choice.


Save the public key to a local file. For example, ~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pub (Linux) or  C:\keys\my-key-pair.pub (Windows). The file name extension for this file is not important.


Save the private key to a different local file that has the .pem extension. For example, ~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pem (Linux) or C:\keys\my-key-pair.pem (Windows). Save the private key file in a safe place. You'll need to provide the name of your key pair when you launch an instance and the corresponding private key each time you connect to the instance.


After you have created the key pair, use one of the following methods to import your key pair to Amazon EC2.

[ New console ]
To import the public key


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Key Pairs.


Choose Import key pair.


For Name, enter a descriptive name for the key pair. The name can include up to 255 ASCII characters. It can’t include leading or trailing spaces.


Either choose Browse to navigate to and select your public key, or paste the contents of your public key into the Public key contents field.


Choose Import key pair.


Verify that the key pair you imported appears in the list of key pairs.



[ Old console ]
To import the public key


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, under NETWORK & SECURITY, choose Key Pairs.


Choose Import Key Pair. 


In the Import Key Pair dialog box, choose Browse, and select the public key file that you saved previously. Enter a name for the key pair in the Key pair name field, and choose Import. The name can include up to 255 ASCII characters. It can’t include leading or trailing spaces.


Verify that the key pair you imported appears in the list of key pairs.



[ AWS CLI ]

Use the Get-EC2KeyPair AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell command.

Tagging a key pair
To help categorize and manage your existing key pairs, you can tag them with custom metadata. For more information about how tags work, see Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources.
You can view, add, and delete tags using the new console and the command line tools.

[ New console ]
To view, add, or delete a tag for an existing key pair


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Key Pairs.


Select a key pair, and then choose Actions, Manage tags.


The Manage tags section displays any tags that are assigned to the key pair.
    To add a tag, choose Add tag, and then enter the tag key and value. You can add up to 50 tags per key pair. For more information, see Tag restrictions.
    To delete a tag, choose Remove next to the tag that you want to delete.


Choose Save changes.



[ AWS CLI ]
To view key pair tags
Use the describe-tags AWS CLI command. In the following example, you describe the tags for all of your key pairs.
$ aws ec2 describe-tags --filters "Name=resource-type,Values=key-pair"
{
    "Tags": [
    {
        "Key": "Environment",
        "ResourceId": "key-0123456789EXAMPLE",
        "ResourceType": "key-pair",
        "Value": "Production"
    },
    {
        "Key": "Environment",
        "ResourceId": "key-9876543210EXAMPLE",
        "ResourceType": "key-pair",
        "Value": "Production"
    }]
}
To describe the tags for a specific key pair
Use the  describe-key-pairs AWS CLI command.
$ aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --key-pair-ids key-0123456789EXAMPLE
{
    "KeyPairs": [
    {
        "KeyName": "MyKeyPair",
        "KeyFingerprint": "1f:51:ae:28:bf:89:e9:d8:1f:25:5d:37:2d:7d:b8:ca:9f:f5:f1:6f",
        "KeyPairId": "key-0123456789EXAMPLE",
        "Tags": [
        {
            "Key": "Environment",
            "Value": "Production"
        }]          
    }]
}
To tag an existing key pair
Use the create-tags AWS CLI command. In the following example, the existing key pair is tagged with Key=Cost-Center and Value=CC-123.
$ aws ec2 create-tags --resources key-0123456789EXAMPLE --tags Key=Cost-Center,Value=CC-123
To delete a tag from a key pair
Use the delete-tags AWS CLI command. For examples, see Examples in the AWS CLI Command Reference.

[ PowerShell ]
To view key pair tags
Use the Get-EC2Tag command.
To describe the tags for a specific key pair
Use the Get-EC2KeyPair command.
To tag an existing key pair
Use the New-EC2Tag command.
To delete a tag from a key pair
Use the Remove-EC2Tag command.

Retrieving the public key for your key pair
On your local Linux or macOS computer, you can use the ssh-keygen command to retrieve the public key for your key pair. Specify the path where you downloaded your private key (the .pem file).
ssh-keygen -y -f /path_to_key_pair/my-key-pair.pem
The command returns the public key, as shown in the following example.
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQClKsfkNkuSevGj3eYhCe53pcjqP3maAhDFcvBS7O6V

BQoQzd8v7yeb7OzlPnWOyN0qFU0XA246RA8QFYiCNYwI3f05p6KLxEXAMPLE
If the command fails, run the following command to ensure that you've changed the permissions on your key pair file so that only you can view it.
chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem
Retrieving the public key for your key pair through instance metadata
The public key that you specified when you launched an instance is also available to you through its instance metadata. To view the public key that you specified when launching the instance, use the following command from your instance:

[ IMDSv2 ]
[ec2-user ~]$ TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"` \

If you change the key pair that you use to connect to the instance, we don't update the instance metadata to show the new public key. Instead, the instance metadata continues to show the public key for the key pair that you specified when you launched the instance. For more information, see Retrieving instance metadata.
Alternatively, on a Linux instance, the public key content is placed in an entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. You can open this file in an editor. The following is an example entry for the key pair named my-key-pair. It consists of the public key followed by the name of the key pair.
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQClKsfkNkuSevGj3eYhCe53pcjqP3maAhDFcvBS7O6V

Locating the public key on an instance
When you launch an instance, you are prompted for a key pair. If you plan to connect to the instance using SSH, you must specify a key pair. You can choose an existing key pair or create a new one. When your instance boots for the first time, the content of the public key that you specified at launch is placed on your Linux instance in an entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
To locate the public key on an instance


Connect to your instance. For more information, see Connect to your Linux instance.


In the terminal window, open the authorized_keys file using your favorite text editor (such as vim or nano).


[ec2-user ~]$ nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
The authorized_keys file opens, displaying the public key, as shown in the following example.
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQClKsfkNkuSevGj3eYhCe53pcjqP3maAhDFcvBS7O6Vhz2ItxCihPnDSUawWNQn/mZphTk/a/gU8jEzoOWbkM4yxyb/wB96xbiFveSFJuOp/d6RJhJOI0iBXrlsLnBItntckiJ7FbtxJMXLvvwJryDUilBMTjYtwBQhYXUMOzce5Pjz5/i8SeJtjnV3iAoG/cQk0FzZqaeJAAHcoCY/5WrUBkrHmFJr6HcXkvJdWPkYQS3xqC0FmUZofz221CBt5IMucxXPkX4rWiz7wB3RbBQoQzd8v7yeb7OzlPnWOyN0qFU0XA246RA8QFYiCNYwI3f05p6KLxEXAMPLE
Identifying the key pair that was specified at launch
When you launch an instance, you are prompted for a key pair. If you plan to connect to the instance using SSH, you must specify a key pair.
To identify the key pair that was specified at launch


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances, and then select your instance.


On the Description tab, the Key pair name field displays the name of the key pair that you specified when you launched the instance. The value of the Key pair name does not change even if you change the public key on the instance, or add key pairs.


(Optional) Verifying your key pair's fingerprint
On the Key Pairs page in the Amazon EC2 console, the Fingerprint column displays the fingerprints generated from your key pairs. AWS calculates the fingerprint differently depending on whether the key pair was generated by AWS or a third-party tool. If you created the key pair using AWS, the fingerprint is calculated using an SHA-1 hash function. If you created the key pair with a third-party tool and uploaded the public key to AWS, or if you generated a new public key from an existing AWS-created private key and uploaded it to AWS, the fingerprint is calculated using an MD5 hash function.
You can use the SSH2 fingerprint that's displayed on the Key Pairs page to verify that the private key you have on your local machine matches the public key stored in AWS. From the computer where you downloaded the private key file, generate an SSH2 fingerprint from the private key file. The output should match the fingerprint that's displayed in the console.
If you created your key pair using AWS, you can use the OpenSSL tools to generate a fingerprint as shown in the following example.
$ openssl pkcs8 -in path_to_private_key -inform PEM -outform DER -topk8 -nocrypt | openssl sha1 -c
If you created a key pair using a third-party tool and uploaded the public key to AWS, you can use the OpenSSL tools to generate the fingerprint as shown in the following example.
$ openssl rsa -in path_to_private_key -pubout -outform DER | openssl md5 -c
If you created an OpenSSH key pair using OpenSSH 7.8 or later and uploaded the public key to AWS, you can use ssh-keygen to generate the fingerprint as shown in the following example.
$ ssh-keygen -ef path_to_private_key -m PEM | openssl rsa -RSAPublicKey_in -outform DER | openssl md5 -c
Adding or replacing a key pair for your instance
You can change the key pair that is used to access the default system account of your instance. For example, if a user in your organization requires access to the system user account using a separate key pair, you can add that key pair to your instance. Or, if someone has a copy of the .pem file and you want to prevent them from connecting to your instance (for example, if they've left your organization), you can replace the key pair with a new one.
To add or replace a key pair, you must be able to connect to your instance. If you've lost your existing private key or you launched your instance without a key pair, you won't be able connect to your instance and therefore won't be able to add or replace a key pair. If you've lost your existing private key, you might be able to retrieve it. For more information, see Connecting to your Linux instance if you lose your private key. If you launched your instance without a key pair, you won't be able to connect to the instance unless you chose an AMI that is configured to allow users another way to log in.
Note
These procedures are for modifying the key pair for the default user account, such as ec2-user. For more information about adding user accounts to your instance, see Managing user accounts on your Amazon Linux instance.
To add or replace a key pair


Create a new key pair using the Amazon EC2 console or a third-party tool.


Retrieve the public key from your new key pair. For more information, see Retrieving the public key for your key pair.


Connect to your instance using your existing private key file.


Using a text editor of your choice, open the .ssh/authorized_keys file on the instance. Paste the public key information from your new key pair underneath the existing public key information. Save the file.


Disconnect from your instance, and test that you can connect to your instance using the new private key file.


(Optional) If you're replacing an existing key pair, connect to your instance and delete the public key information for the original key pair from the .ssh/authorized_keys file.


Note
If you're using an Auto Scaling group, ensure that the key pair you're replacing is not specified in your launch template or launch configuration. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches a replacement instance if it detects an unhealthy instance; however, the instance launch fails if the key pair cannot be found. 
Deleting your key pair
When you delete a key pair, you are only deleting the Amazon EC2 copy of the public key. Deleting a key pair doesn't affect the private key on your computer or the public key on any instances that already launched using that key pair. You can't launch a new instance using a deleted key pair, but you can continue to connect to any instances that you launched using a deleted key pair, as long as you still have the private key (.pem) file.
If you're using an Auto Scaling group (for example, in an Elastic Beanstalk environment), ensure that the key pair you're deleting is not specified in your launch configuration. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches a replacement instance if it detects an unhealthy instance; however, the instance launch fails if the key pair cannot be found. 
You can delete a key pair using one of the following methods.

[ New console ]
To delete your key pair


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Key Pairs.


Select the key pair to delete and choose Delete.


In the confirmation field, enter Delete and then choose Delete.



[ Old console ]
To delete your key pair


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, under NETWORK & SECURITY, choose Key Pairs.


Select the key pair and choose Delete.


When prompted, choose Yes.



[ AWS CLI ]
To delete your key pair
Use the delete-key-pair AWS CLI command.

[ PowerShell ]
To delete your key pair
Use the Remove-EC2KeyPair AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell command.

If you create a Linux AMI from an instance, and then use the AMI to launch a new instance in a different Region or account, the new instance includes the public key from the original instance. This enables you to connect to the new instance using the same private key file as your original instance. You can remove this public key from your instance by removing its entry from the .ssh/authorized_keys file using a text editor of your choice. For more information about managing users on your instance and providing remote access using a specific key pair, see Managing user accounts on your Amazon Linux instance.
