# Update management in Amazon EC2<a name="update-management"></a>

We recommend that you regularly patch, update, and secure the operating system and applications on your EC2 instances\. You can use [AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html) to automate the process of installing security\-related updates for both the operating system and applications\. Alternatively, you can use any automatic update services or recommended processes for installing updates that are provided by the application vendor\.
