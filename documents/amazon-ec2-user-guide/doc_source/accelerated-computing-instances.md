# Linux accelerated computing instances<a name="accelerated-computing-instances"></a>

If you require high processing capability, you'll benefit from using accelerated computing instances, which provide access to hardware\-based compute accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units \(GPUs\) or Field Programmable Gate Arrays \(FPGAs\)\. Accelerated computing instances enable more parallelism for higher throughput on compute\-intensive workloads\.

GPU\-based instances provide access to NVIDIA GPUs with thousands of compute cores\. You can use GPU\-based accelerated computing instances to accelerate scientific, engineering, and rendering applications by leveraging the CUDA or Open Computing Language \(OpenCL\) parallel computing frameworks\. You can also use them for graphics applications, including game streaming, 3\-D application streaming, and other graphics workloads\.

FPGA\-based instances provide access to large FPGAs with millions of parallel system logic cells\. You can use FPGA\-based accelerated computing instances to accelerate workloads such as genomics, financial analysis, real\-time video processing, big data analysis, and security workloads by leveraging custom hardware accelerations\. You can develop these accelerations using hardware description languages such as Verilog or VHDL, or by using higher\-level languages such as OpenCL parallel computing frameworks\. You can either develop your own hardware acceleration code or purchase hardware accelerations through the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/)\.

**Important**  
FPGA\-based instances do not support Microsoft Windows\.

You can cluster accelerated computing instances into a cluster placement group\. Cluster placement groups provide low latency and high\-bandwidth connectivity between the instances within a single Availability Zone\. For more information, see [Placement groups](placement-groups.md)\.

## Accelerated computing instance families<a name="gpu-instance-families"></a>

Accelerated computing instance families use hardware accelerators, or co\-processors, to perform some functions, such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs\. The following accelerated computing instance families are available for you to launch in Amazon EC2\.

**F1 instances**  
F1 instances use Xilinx UltraScale\+ VU9P FPGAs and are designed to accelerate computationally intensive algorithms, such as data\-flow or highly parallel operations not suited to general purpose CPUs\. Each FPGA in an F1 instance contains approximately 2\.5 million logic elements and approximately 6,800 Digital Signal Processing \(DSP\) engines, along with 64 GiB of local DDR ECC protected memory, connected to the instance by a dedicated PCIe Gen3 x16 connection\. F1 instances provide local NVMe SSD volumes\.

Developers can use the FPGA Developer AMI and AWS Hardware Developer Kit to create custom hardware accelerations for use on F1 instances\. The FPGA Developer AMI includes development tools for full\-cycle FPGA development in the cloud\. Using these tools, developers can create and share Amazon FPGA Images \(AFIs\) that can be loaded onto the FPGA of an F1 instance\.

For more information, see [Amazon EC2 F1 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/)\.

For more information about the hardware specifications for each Amazon EC2 instance type, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)\.

For more information about specifying CPU options, see [Optimizing CPU options](instance-optimize-cpu.md)\.

## Instance performance<a name="gpu-instance-performance"></a>

There are several GPU setting optimizations that you can perform to achieve the best performance on your instances\. For more information, see [Optimizing GPU settings](optimize_gpu.md)\.

EBS\-optimized instances enable you to get consistently high performance for your EBS volumes by eliminating contention between Amazon EBS I/O and other network traffic from your instance\. Some accelerated computing instances are EBS\-optimized by default at no additional cost\. For more information, see [Amazon EBSâ€“optimized instances](ebs-optimized.md)\.

Some accelerated computing instance types provide the ability to control processor C\-states and P\-states on Linux\. C\-states control the sleep levels that a core can enter when it is inactive, while P\-states control the desired performance \(in CPU frequency\) from a core\. For more information, see [Processor state control for your EC2 instance](processor_state_control.md)\.

## Network performance<a name="gpu-network-performance"></a>

You can enable enhanced networking on supported instance types to provide lower latencies, lower network jitter, and higher packet\-per\-second \(PPS\) performance\. Most applications do not consistently need a high level of network performance, but can benefit from access to increased bandwidth when they send or receive data\. For more information, see [Enhanced networking on Linux](enhanced-networking.md)\.

The following is a summary of network performance for accelerated computing instances that support enhanced networking\.


| Instance type | Network performance | Enhanced networking | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  f1\.2xlarge \| f1\.4xlarge \| g3\.4xlarge \| p3\.2xlarge  | Up to 10 Gbps â€  | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
|  g3s\.xlarge \| g3\.8xlarge \| p2\.8xlarge \| p3\.8xlarge  | 10 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
|  g4dn\.xlarge \| g4dn\.2xlarge \| g4dn\.4xlarge \| inf1\.xlarge \| inf1\.2xlarge  | Up to 25 Gbps â€  | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
|  f1\.16xlarge \| g3\.16xlarge \| inf1\.6xlarge \| p2\.16xlarge \| p3\.16xlarge  | 25 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
|  g4dn\.8xlarge \| g4dn\.12xlarge \| g4dn\.16xlarge  | 50 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
| g4dn\.metal \| inf1\.24xlarge \| p3dn\.24xlarge | 100 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 

â€  These instances use a network I/O credit mechanism to allocate network bandwidth to instances based on average bandwidth utilization\. They accrue credits when their bandwidth is below their baseline bandwidth, and can use these credits when they perform network data transfers\. For more information, open a support case and ask about baseline bandwidth for the specific instance types that you are interested in\.

## Instance features<a name="gpu-instances-features"></a>

**\*** The root device volume must be an Amazon EBS volume\.

For more information, see the following:
+ [Amazon EBS and NVMe on Linux instances](nvme-ebs-volumes.md)
+ [Amazon EC2 instance store](InstanceStorage.md)
+ [Placement groups](placement-groups.md)

## Release notes<a name="gpu-instance-current-limitations"></a>
+ You must launch the instance using an HVM AMI\.
+ Instances built on the [Nitro System](instance-types.md#ec2-nitro-instances) have the following requirements:
  + [NVMe drivers](nvme-ebs-volumes.md) must be installed
  + [Elastic Network Adapter \(ENA\) drivers](enhanced-networking-ena.md) must be installed

  The following Linux AMIs meet these requirements:
  + Amazon Linux 2
  + Amazon Linux AMI 2018\.03
  + Ubuntu 14\.04 \(with `linux-aws` kernel\) or later
  + Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7\.4 or later
  + SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2 or later
  + CentOS 7\.4\.1708 or later
  + FreeBSD 11\.1 or later
  + Debian GNU/Linux 9 or later
+ GPU\-based instances can't access the GPU unless the NVIDIA drivers are installed\. For more information, see [Installing NVIDIA drivers on Linux instances](install-nvidia-driver.md)\.
+ Launching a bare metal instance boots the underlying server, which includes verifying all hardware and firmware components\. This means that it can take 20 minutes from the time the instance enters the running state until it becomes available over the network\.
+ To attach or detach EBS volumes or secondary network interfaces from a bare metal instance requires PCIe native hotplug support\. Amazon Linux 2 and the latest versions of the Amazon Linux AMI support PCIe native hotplug, but earlier versions do not\. You must enable the following Linux kernel configuration options:

  ```
  CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_PCIE=y
  CONFIG_PCIEASPM=y
  ```
+ Bare metal instances use a PCI\-based serial device rather than an I/O port\-based serial device\. The upstream Linux kernel and the latest Amazon Linux AMIs support this device\. Bare metal instances also provide an ACPI SPCR table to enable the system to automatically use the PCI\-based serial device\. The latest Windows AMIs automatically use the PCI\-based serial device\.
+ There is a limit of 100 AFIs per Region\.
+ There is a limit on the total number of instances that you can launch in a Region, and there are additional limits on some instance types\. For more information, see [How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2?](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_many_instances_can_I_run_in_Amazon_EC2) in the Amazon EC2 FAQ\.
