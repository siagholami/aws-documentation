# Working with Dedicated Hosts<a name="how-dedicated-hosts-work"></a>

To use a Dedicated Host, you first allocate hosts for use in your account\. You then launch instances onto the hosts by specifying *host* tenancy for the instance\. You must select a specific host for the instance to launch on to, or you can allow it to launch on to any host that has auto\-placement enabled and matches its instance type\. When an instance is stopped and restarted, the *Host affinity* setting determines whether it's restarted on the same, or a different, host\.

If you no longer need an On\-Demand host, you can stop the instances running on the host, direct them to launch on a different host, and then *release* the host\.

Dedicated Hosts are also integrated with AWS License Manager\. With License Manager, you can create a host resource group, which is a collection of Dedicated Hosts that are managed as a single entity\. When creating a host resource group, you specify the host management preferences, such as auto\-allocate and auto\-release, for the Dedicated Hosts\. This allows you to launch instances onto Dedicated Hosts without manually allocating and managing those hosts\. For more information, see [ Host Resource Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/userguide/host-resource-groups.html) in the *AWS License Manager User Guide*\.

## Allocating Dedicated Hosts<a name="dedicated-hosts-allocating"></a>

To begin using Dedicated Hosts, you must allocate Dedicated Hosts in your account using the Amazon EC2 console or the command line tools\. After you allocate the Dedicated Host, the Dedicated Host capacity is made available in your account immediately and you can start launching instances onto the Dedicated Host\.

Support for multiple instance types on the same Dedicated Host is available for the following instance families: `c5`, `m5`, `r5`, `c5n`, `r5n`, and `m5n`\. Other instance families support only a single instance type on the same Dedicated Host\.

You can allocate a Dedicated Host using the following methods\.

------
#### [ New console ]

**To allocate a Dedicated Host**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Dedicated Hosts** and then choose **Allocate Dedicated Host**\.

1. For **Instance family**, choose the instance family for the Dedicated Host\.

1. Specify whether the Dedicated Host supports multiple instance types within the selected instance family, or a specific instance type only\. Do one of the following\.
   + To configure the Dedicated Host to support multiple instance types in the selected instance family, for **Support multiple instance types**, choose **Enable**\. Enabling this allows you to launch different instance types from the same instance family onto the Dedicated Host\. For example, if you choose the `m5` instance family and choose this option, you can launch `m5.xlarge` and `m5.4xlarge` instances onto the Dedicated Host\.
   + To configure the Dedicated Host to support a single instance type within the selected instance family, clear **Support multiple instance types**, and then for **Instance type**, choose the instance type to support\. This allows you to launch a single instance type on the Dedicated Host\. For example, if you choose this option and specify `m5.4xlarge` as the supported instance type, you can launch only `m5.4xlarge` instances onto the Dedicated Host\.

1. For **Availability Zone**, choose the Availability Zone in which to allocate the Dedicated Host\.

1. To allow the Dedicated Host to accept untargeted instance launches that match its instance type, for **Instance auto\-placement**, choose **Enable**\. For more information about auto\-placement, see [Understanding auto\-placement and affinity](#dedicated-hosts-understanding)\.

1. To enable host recovery for the Dedicated Host, for **Host recovery**, choose **Enable**\. For more information, see [Host recovery](dedicated-hosts-recovery.md)\.

1. For **Quantity**, enter the number of Dedicated Hosts to allocate\.

1. \(Optional\) Choose **Add Tag** and enter a tag key and a tag value\.

1. Choose **Allocate**\.

#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To allocate a Dedicated Host**  
Use the [allocate\-hosts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-hosts.html) AWS CLI command\. The following command allocates a Dedicated Host that supports multiple instance types from the `m5` instance family in `us-east-1a` Availability Zone\. The host also has host recovery enabled and it has auto\-placement disabled\.

```
aws ec2 allocate-hosts --instance-family "m5" --availability-zone "us-east-1a" --auto-placement "off" --host-recovery "on" --quantity 1 
```

The following command allocates a Dedicated Host that supports *untargeted* `m4.large` instance launches in the `eu-west-1a` Availability Zone, enables host recovery, and applies a tag with a key of `purpose` and a value of `production`\.

```
aws ec2 allocate-hosts --instance-type "m4.large" --availability-zone "eu-west-1a" --auto-placement "on" --host-recovery "on" --quantity 1 --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=dedicated-host,Tags=[{Key=purpose,Value=production}]'
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To allocate a Dedicated Host**  
Use the [New\-EC2Host](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Host.html) AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell command\. The following command allocates a Dedicated Host that supports multiple instance types from the `m5` instance family in `us-east-1a` Availability Zone\. The host also has host recovery enabled and it has auto\-placement disabled\.

```
PS C:\> New-EC2Host -InstanceFamily m5 -AvailabilityZone us-east-1a -AutoPlacement Off -HostRecovery On -Quantity 1
```

The following commands allocate a Dedicated Host that supports *untargeted* `m4.large` instance launches in the `eu-west-1a` Availability Zone, enable host recovery, and apply a tag with a key of `purpose` and a value of `production`\.

The `TagSpecification` parameter used to tag a Dedicated Host on creation requires an object that specifies the type of resource to be tagged, the tag key, and the tag value\. The following commands create the required object\.

```
PS C:\> $tag = @{ Key="purpose"; Value="production" }
PS C:\> $tagspec = new-object Amazon.EC2.Model.TagSpecification
PS C:\> $tagspec.ResourceType = "dedicated-host"
PS C:\> $tagspec.Tags.Add($tag)
```

The following command allocates the Dedicated Host and applies the tag specified in the `$tagspec` object\.

```
PS C:\> New-EC2Host -InstanceType m4.large -AvailabilityZone eu-west-1a -AutoPlacement On -HostRecovery On -Quantity 1 -TagSpecification $tagspec
```

## Launching instances onto a Dedicated Host<a name="launching-dedicated-hosts-instances"></a>

After you have allocated a Dedicated Host, you can launch instances onto it\. You can't launch instances with `host` tenancy if you do not have active Dedicated Hosts with enough available capacity for the instance type that you are launching\.

**Note**  
The instances launched onto Dedicated Hosts can only be launched in a VPC\. For more information, see [Introduction to VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Introduction.html)\.

Before you launch your instances, take note of the limitations\. For more information, see [Dedicated Hosts restrictions](dedicated-hosts-overview.md#dedicated-hosts-limitations)\.

You can launch an instance onto a Dedicated Host using the following methods\.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To launch an instance onto a specific Dedicated Host from the Dedicated Hosts page**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. Choose **Dedicated Hosts** in the navigation pane\.

1. On the **Dedicated Hosts** page, select a host and choose **Actions**, **Launch Instance\(s\) onto Host**\.

## Launching instances into a host resource group<a name="launching-hrg-instances"></a>

When you launch an instance into a host resource group that has a Dedicated Host with available instance capacity, Amazon EC2 launches the instance onto that host\. If the host resource group does not have a host with available instance capacity, Amazon EC2 automatically allocates a new host in the host resource group, and then launches the instance onto that host\. For more information, see [ Host Resource Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/userguide/host-resource-groups.html) in the *AWS License Manager User Guide*\.

**Requirements and limits**
+ You must associate a core\- or socket\-based license configuration with the AMI\.
+ You can't use SQL Server, SUSE, or RHEL AMIs provided by Amazon EC2 with Dedicated Hosts\.
+ You can't target a specific host by choosing a host ID, and you can't enable instance affinity when launching an instance into a host resource group\.

You can launch an instance into a host resource group using the following methods\.

## Understanding auto\-placement and affinity<a name="dedicated-hosts-understanding"></a>

Placement control for Dedicated Hosts happens on both the instance level and host level\.

### Auto\-placement<a name="dedicated-hosts-auto-placement"></a>

Auto\-placement is configured at the host level\. It allows you to manage whether instances that you launch are launched onto a specific host, or onto any available host that has matching configurations\.

When the auto\-placement of a Dedicated Host is *disabled*, it only accepts *Host* tenancy instance launches that specify its unique host ID\. This is the default setting for new Dedicated Hosts\.

When the auto\-placement of a Dedicated Host is *enabled*, it accepts any untargeted instance launches that match its instance type configuration\.

When launching an instance, you need to configure its tenancy\. Launching an instance onto a Dedicated Host without providing a specific `HostId` enables it to launch on any Dedicated Host that has auto\-placement *enabled* and that matches its instance type\.

### Host affinity<a name="dedicated-hosts-affinity"></a>

Host affinity is configured at the instance level\. It establishes a launch relationship between an instance and a Dedicated Host\.

When affinity is set to `Host`, an instance launched onto a specific host always restarts on the same host if stopped\. This applies to both targeted and untargeted launches\.

When affinity is set to `Off`, and you stop and restart the instance, it can be restarted on any available host\. However, it tries to launch back onto the last Dedicated Host on which it ran \(on a best\-effort basis\)\.

## Modifying Dedicated Host auto\-placement<a name="modify-host-auto-placement"></a>

You can modify the auto\-placement settings of a Dedicated Host after you have allocated it to your AWS account, using one of the following methods\.

------
#### [ New console ]

**To modify the auto\-placement of a Dedicated Host**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Dedicated Hosts**\.

1. Select a host and choose **Actions**, **Modify host**\.

1. For **Instance auto\-placement**, choose **Enable** to enable auto\-placement, or clear **Enable** to disable auto\-placement\. For more information, see [Understanding auto\-placement and affinity](#dedicated-hosts-understanding)\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

------
#### [ Old console ]

**To modify the auto\-placement of a Dedicated Host**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the **Dedicated Hosts** page, select a host and choose **Actions**, **Modify Auto\-Placement**\.

1. On the Modify Auto\-placement window, for **Allow instance auto\-placement**, choose **Yes** to enable auto\-placement, or choose **No** to disable auto\-placement\. For more information, see [Understanding auto\-placement and affinity](#dedicated-hosts-understanding)\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To modify the auto\-placement of a Dedicated Host**  
Use the [modify\-hosts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-hosts.html) AWS CLI command\. The following example enables auto\-placement for the specified Dedicated Host\.

```
aws ec2 modify-hosts --auto-placement on --host-ids h-012a3456b7890cdef
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To modify the auto\-placement of a Dedicated Host**  
Use the [Edit\-EC2Host](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2Host.html) AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell command\. The following example enables auto\-placement for the specified Dedicated Host\.

```
PS C:\> Edit-EC2Host --AutoPlacement 1 --HostId h-012a3456b7890cdef
```

------

## Modifying the supported instance types<a name="modify-host-support"></a>

Support for multiple instance types on the same Dedicated Host is available for the following instance families: `c5`, `m5`, `r5`, `c5n`, `r5n`, and `m5n`\. Other instance families support only a single instance type on the same Dedicated Host\.

You can allocate a Dedicated Host using the following methods\.

You can modify a Dedicated Host to change the instance types that it supports\. If it currently supports a single instance type, you can modify it to support multiple instance types within that instance family\. Similarly, if it currently supports multiple instance types, you can modify it to support a specific instance type only\.

To modify a Dedicated Host to support multiple instance types, you must first stop all running instances on the host\. The modification takes approximately 10 minutes to complete\. The Dedicated Host transitions to the `pending` state while the modification is in progress\. You can't start stopped instances or launch new instances on the Dedicated Host while it is in the `pending` state\.

To modify a Dedicated Host that supports multiple instance types to support only a single instance type, the host must either have no running instances, or the running instances must be of the instance type that you want the host to support\. For example, to modify a host that supports multiple instance types in the `m5` instance family to support only `m5.large` instances, the Dedicated Host must either have no running instances, or it must have only `m5.large` instances running on it\.

You can modify the supported instance types using one of the following methods\.

------
#### [ New console ]

## Tagging Dedicated Hosts<a name="dedicated-hosts-tagging"></a>

You can assign custom tags to your existing Dedicated Hosts to categorize them in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment\. This helps you to quickly find a specific Dedicated Host based on the custom tags that you assigned\. Dedicated Host tags can also be used for cost allocation tracking\.

You can also apply tags to Dedicated Hosts at the time of creation\. For more information, see [Allocating Dedicated Hosts](#dedicated-hosts-allocating)\.

You can tag a Dedicated Host using the following methods\.

------
#### [ New console ]

**To tag a Dedicated Host**

```
aws ec2 create-tags --resources h-abc12345678909876 --tags Key=Owner,Value=TeamA
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To tag a Dedicated Host**  
Use the [New\-EC2Tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Tag.html) AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell command\.

The `New-EC2Tag` command needs a `Tag` object, which specifies the key and value pair to be used for the Dedicated Host tag\. The following commands create a `Tag` object named `$tag`, with a key and value pair of `Owner` and `TeamA` respectively\.

```
PS C:\> $tag = New-Object Amazon.EC2.Model.Tag
PS C:\> $tag.Key = "Owner"
PS C:\> $tag.Value = "TeamA"
```

The following command tags the specified Dedicated Host with the `$tag` object\.

```

------

The following table explains the possible Dedicated Host states\.


| **State** | **Description** | 
| --- | --- | 
| available | AWS hasn't detected an issue with the Dedicated Host\. No maintenance or repairs are scheduled\. Instances can be launched onto this Dedicated Host\. | 
| released | The Dedicated Host has been released\. The host ID is no longer in use\. Released hosts can't be reused\. |

| pending | The Dedicated Host cannot be used for new instance launches\. It is either being [ modified to support multiple instance types](#modify-host-support), or a [host recovery](dedicated-hosts-recovery.md) is in progress\. | 
| permanent\-failure | An unrecoverable failure has been detected\. You receive an eviction notice through your instances and by email\. Your instances might continue to run\. If you stop or terminate all instances on a Dedicated Host with this state, AWS retires the host\. AWS does not restart instances in this state\. Instances can't be launched onto Dedicated Hosts in this state\. | 
| released\-permanent\-failure | AWS permanently releases Dedicated Hosts that have failed and no longer have running instances on them\. The Dedicated Host ID is no longer available for use\. | 

## Releasing Dedicated Hosts<a name="dedicated-hosts-releasing"></a>

Any running instances on the Dedicated Host must be stopped before you can release the host\. These instances can be migrated to other Dedicated Hosts in your account so that you can continue to use them\. These steps apply only to On\-Demand Dedicated Hosts\.

You can release a Dedicated Host using the following methods\.

------
#### [ New console ]

```
aws ec2 release-hosts --host-ids h-012a3456b7890cdef
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To release a Dedicated Host**  
Use the [Remove\-EC2Hosts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Remove-EC2Host.html) AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell command\.

```
PS C:\> Remove-EC2Hosts -HostId h-012a3456b7890cdef
```

------

After you release a Dedicated Host, you can't reuse the same host or host ID again, and you are no longer charged On\-Demand billing rates for it\. The state of the Dedicated Host is changed to `released`, and you are not able to launch any instances onto that host\.

**Note**  
If you have recently released Dedicated Hosts, it can take some time for them to stop counting towards your limit\. During this time, you might experience `LimitExceeded` errors when trying to allocate new Dedicated Hosts\. If this is the case, try allocating new hosts again after a few minutes\.

The instances that were stopped are still available for use and are listed on the **Instances** page\. They retain their `host` tenancy setting\.
