Update management in Amazon EC2
We recommend that you regularly patch, update, and secure the operating system and applications on your EC2 instances. You can use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate the process of installing security-related updates for both the operating system and applications. Alternatively, you can use any automatic update services or recommended processes for installing updates that are provided by the application vendor.
