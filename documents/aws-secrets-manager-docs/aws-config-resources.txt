AWS Config Supported Resources for Secrets Manager
AWS resources are entities you create and manage using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), the AWS SDKs, or AWS partner tools. AWS Config refers to each resource using a unique identifier, such as the resource ID or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
AWS Config supports the Secrets Manager resource, AWS::SecretsManager::Secret. For more information, see AWS Config Developer Guide.
