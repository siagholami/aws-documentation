Security in AWS Secrets Manager
Security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. 
You and AWS share the responsibility for security. The shared responsibility model describes this as security of the cloud and security in the cloud: 
 Security of the cloud – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services you can use securely. Third-party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the AWS Compliance Programs. To learn about the compliance programs that apply to AWS Secrets Manager, see AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program. 
 Security in the cloud – Your AWS service determines your responsibility. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your company’s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.
