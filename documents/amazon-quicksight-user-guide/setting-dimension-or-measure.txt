Setting a Field as a Dimension or Measure
In the Field list pane, dimension fields have blue icons and measure fields have green icons. Dimensions are text or date fields that may be items, like products, or attributes that are related to measures and can be used to partition them, like sales date for sales figures. Measures are numeric values that you use for measurement, comparison, and aggregation. If Amazon QuickSight interpreted a field as a measure and you would rather use it as a dimension (or the other way around), you can change the setting for that field.
Changing a field's measure or dimension setting changes it for all visuals in the analysis that use that data set, but does not change it in the data set itself.
Change a Field's Dimension or Measure Setting


In the Field list pane, hover over the field you want to change.


Choose the selector icon to the right of the field name, and then choose Convert to dimension or Convert to measure as appropriate.
