# Selecting Fields<a name="selecting-fields"></a>

When you prepare data, only the fields you select on the data preparation page are available for subsequent use in a visual\. By default, all of the fields in the table or file you are preparing are selected\. You can toggle a field by either selecting or deselecting its check box in the **Fields** pane\.

You can also toggle a field by hovering over the field menu, which appears next to each field on hover\. Then choose either **Exclude field** or **Include field**\. The same menu contains additional actions, such as **Rename field**, **Add calculation**, and **Change data type**\.

You can select or deselect all fields at once by choosing either **All** or **None** at the top of the **Fields** pane\.

If you edit a data set and exclude a field that is used in a visual, that visual breaks\. You can fix it the next time you open that analysis\.

## Searching for Fields<a name="searching-for-a-field-data-prep"></a>

If you have a long field list in the **Fields** pane, you can search to locate a specific field by typing a search term for **Search fields**\. Any field whose name contains the search term is shown\. 

Search is case\-insensitive and wildcards are not supported\. Choose the cancel icon \(**X**\) to the right of the search box to return to viewing all fields\.
