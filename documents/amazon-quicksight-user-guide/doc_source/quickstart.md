# Amazon QuickSight Quick Start Guide<a name="quickstart"></a>

Welcome to the *Amazon QuickSight Quick Start Guide*, designed for business analysts\. Using Amazon QuickSight, you can import or connect to your data, analyze your data, and share your data visualizations in a dashboard\. You can let Amazon QuickSight choose the format of your visual by leaving the AutoGraph on, or you can choose from a wide variety of charts, graphs, tables to create a customized visual data analysis\. You can then group these together to form stories and dashboards\. Then you can share them with your team\.

## How Does Amazon QuickSight Work?<a name="quick-intro"></a>

You begin by choosing a dataset\. You can groom your dataset by adding new data elements, creating calculations, or filtering out data\. When you're satisfied that the dataset works for you, you can start analyzing it through graphics\. 

First, you can create a visual representation of your data\. If you don't know what kind of chart you should use, Amazon QuickSight can help you by choosing a visual type for you\. To see this in action, choose some fields\. As you choose more fields, Amazon QuickSight's AutoGraph changes the type of visual it displays\. It adapts to what you choose\.

You can continue to add more visuals to the same analysis, based on different views of the same underlying data\. To fit more visuals on a page, you can resize and rearrange them\. Scroll down to find more space on the page\.

By creating a series of visuals, you create a story\. This visual narrative tells you what is happening in the subject you're investigating\. You can save multiple stories, using filters to show how the data changes over time\. Any of these visual data analyses can be shared with other people, who can then further analyze the data\. 

You can use Amazon QuickSight to publish data dashboards\. These are read\-only snapshots that you can share for reporting\. If you choose, you can also allow other people to create a new analysis and dashboard based on the one you shared with them\.
