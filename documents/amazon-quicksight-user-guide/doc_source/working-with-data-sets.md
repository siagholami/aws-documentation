# Working with Data Sets<a name="working-with-data-sets"></a>

A data set identifies the specific data in a data source that you want to use\. For example, the data source might be a table if you are connecting to a database data source, or a file if you are connecting to an Amazon S3 data source\. A data set also stores any data preparation you have performed on that data, such as renaming a field or changing its data type\. Storing this preparation means that you don't have to reprepare the data each time you want to create an analysis based on it\.
