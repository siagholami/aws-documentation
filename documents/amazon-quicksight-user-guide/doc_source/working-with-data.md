# Working with Data in Amazon QuickSight<a name="working-with-data"></a>

You can base your Amazon QuickSight analyses on a variety of data sources, including AWS data stores, Salesforce, files in common formats, and popular database engines\. You connect to these data sources and create data sets, which identify the specific data from that data source that you want to work with\. Data sets also store any data preparation you have done on that data, so that you can reuse that prepared data in multiple analyses\. For more information on preparing data, see [Preparing Data](preparing-data.md)\.

You can view your available data sets on the **Your Data Sets** page, which you reach by choosing **Manage data** on the Amazon QuickSight start page\. You can view available data sources and create a new data set on the **Create a Data Set** page, which you reach by choosing **New data set** on the **Your Data Sets** page\.
