One of several scope icons displays to the right of the filter name to indicate the scope set on that filter\. The scope icon resembled four boxes in a square\. If all boxes are filled, the filter applies to all visuals on the analysis sheet\. If only one box is filled, the filter applies to the selected visual only\. If some boxes are filled, the filter applies to some of the visuals on the sheet, including the one currently selected\.
