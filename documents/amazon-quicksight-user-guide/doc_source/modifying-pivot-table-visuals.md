# Modifying Pivot Table Visuals<a name="modifying-pivot-table-visuals"></a>

When you work with a pivot table, you can modify it in a number of ways to customize the visual to your needs\. As with all visual types, you can add and remove fields, change the field associated with a visual element, change field aggregation, change date field granularity, and focus on or exclude rows or columns\. For more information about how to make these changes to a pivot table, see the topics under [Changing the Fields Used by a Visual in Amazon QuickSight](changing-visual-fields.md)\.

There are also some ways to modify pivot tables that are exclusive to this visual type, as follows:
+ Change the pivot table format to display by rows or by columns\.
+ Expand or collapse clustered rows or columns to show or hide subcategories\.
+ Sort the rows in the pivot table by the values in a selected column\.
+ Add table calculations \(like rank or difference\) to cell values\.
