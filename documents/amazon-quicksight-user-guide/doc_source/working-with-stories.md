# Working with Stories<a name="working-with-stories"></a>

You can use a story to preserve multiple iterations of an analysis and then play them sequentially to provide a narrative about the analysis data\. For example, you might want to see several versions of the analysis, all with the same charts but with different filters applied\.

A captured iteration of an analysis is called a scene\. A scene preserves the visuals that are in the analysis at the time you create it, including such things as filtering and sort order\. The data in the visuals is not captured as part of the scene\. When you play the story, visuals will reflect the current data in the data set\.

Every analysis comes with a default story called **Storyboard 1**\. When working in an analysis, you can add scenes to **Storyboard 1** by choosing **Capture** on the application bar\. You can rename **Storyboard 1** by using the procedure in [Rename a Story or Scene](#rename-a-story)\.
