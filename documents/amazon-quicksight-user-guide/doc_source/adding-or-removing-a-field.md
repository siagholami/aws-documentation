# Adding or Removing a Field<a name="adding-or-removing-a-field"></a>

You can add a field to a visual by choosing it on the **Fields list** pane, dragging it to a drop target on the visual, or dragging it to a field well\. There is a 1:1 correspondence of drop targets to field wells for each visual type, so you can use whichever method you prefer\.

To remove a field from a visual, deselect it in the **Fields list** pane, or choose an on\-visual editor or field well that uses that field, and then choose **Remove** from the pop\-up menu\.

You can also let Amazon QuickSight map the field to the most appropriate visual element\. To do so, simply choose the field in the **Fields list** pane\. Amazon QuickSight adds the field to the visual by populating the first empty field well that corresponds with that field type \(either measure or dimension\)\. If all of the visual elements are already populated, Amazon QuickSight determines the most appropriate field well and replaces the field in it with the field you selected\.
