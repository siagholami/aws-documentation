# Setting a Field as a Dimension or Measure<a name="setting-dimension-or-measure"></a>

In the **Field list** pane, dimension fields have blue icons and measure fields have green icons\. Dimensions are text or date fields that may be items, like products, or attributes that are related to measures and can be used to partition them, like sales date for sales figures\. Measures are numeric values that you use for measurement, comparison, and aggregation\. If Amazon QuickSight interpreted a field as a measure and you would rather use it as a dimension \(or the other way around\), you can change the setting for that field\.

Changing a field's measure or dimension setting changes it for all visuals in the analysis that use that data set, but does not change it in the data set itself\.
