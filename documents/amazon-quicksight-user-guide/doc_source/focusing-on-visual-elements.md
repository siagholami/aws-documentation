# Focusing on Visual Elements<a name="focusing-on-visual-elements"></a>

When viewing visuals, you can choose an element on the visual, and then choose to focus on the element\. Elements to focus on can include, for example, a bar or bubble, or a row or column header in the case of a pivot table\.

Focusing on the element creates a filter that removes all other elements except for the one you selected:

To see the other elements again, either choose **Undo** on the application bar, or disable or delete the filter\.
