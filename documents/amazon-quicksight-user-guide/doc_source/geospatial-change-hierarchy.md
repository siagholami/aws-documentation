1. Choose the ellipsis icon \(**\.\.\.**\), then choose one of the following options\.

   Choose **Disband hierarchy** to remove the hierarchy from the data set\. You can't undo this operation\. However, you can recreate your hierarchy or grouping by starting again at step 1\. Disbanding the hierarchy doesn't remove any fields from the data set\.

   Choose **Edit hierarchy** to make changes to the hierarchy\. Doing this reopens the creation screens, so you can make different choices in rebuilding your hierarchy\.
