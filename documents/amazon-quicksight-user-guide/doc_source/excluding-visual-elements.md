# Excluding Visual Elements<a name="excluding-visual-elements"></a>

When viewing visuals, you can choose an element \(like a bar or bubble, or a row or column header in the case of a pivot table\), and then choose to exclude the element\. The exception is that you can't exclude elements that are mapped to date fields\. You can exclude multiple elements on a single chart\.

Excluding the element creates a filter that removes only that element from the visual:

To see the excluded element again, either choose **Undo** on the application bar, or disable or delete the filter\.
