# Managing Subscriptions<a name="managing-subscriptions"></a>

You can purchase standard user subscriptions to get discounted pricing on Amazon QuickSight\. When you create an Amazon QuickSight account, you automatically get one free user account\. When you invite additional users to Amazon QuickSight, you are charged for those user accounts on a month\-by\-month basis\. If you have Enterprise edition, you have the option to take advantage of pay\-per\-session pricing for reader accounts\. These are users who only view data dashboards, and don't need author or admin access\. When you purchase a subscription, you pay for a user account on an annual rather than monthly basis, and receive a discounted price in return for the extended time commitment\. For more information about pricing, see [Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/pricing/)\.

When you purchase a set of standard user subscriptions, you choose the number of user accounts you want to cover\. You also choose when the subscriptions should start \(any time from the month following the current month, to one year in the future\) and whether the subscriptions autorenew\. All subscriptions that you purchase together must use the same values for these settings\.

You can edit an existing set of user subscriptions to change whether it autorenews\. If the set is not yet active, you can also change the number of subscriptions it covers, or delete it entirely\.
