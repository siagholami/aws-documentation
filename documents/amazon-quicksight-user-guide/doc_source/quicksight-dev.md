AWS provides libraries, sample code, tutorials, and other resources for software developers who prefer to build applications using language\-specific API operations instead of submitting a request over HTTPS\. These libraries provide basic functions that automatically take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing your requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses, so that it's easier for you to get started\.
