# Signing In to Amazon QuickSight<a name="signing-in"></a>

You can sign in on the Amazon QuickSight page, [https://quicksight\.aws\.amazon\.com/](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/)\. Follow the screen prompts to sign in\. For your convenience, the procedure is outlined here\. It varies slightly depending on the type of account you have\. 

1. For **Account name**, type the Amazon QuickSight account name\. This is the name that was created for this Amazon QuickSight subscription\. You should take note of it in case you need it later\. 

1. If you are prompted for your email address, type it in\. 

1. If the username is blank, type the user name you want to use to sign in\. Choose one of the following:
   + For organizational users – the user name provided by your administrator\. 

     Your account can be based on IAM credentials, a Single Sign\-On \(SSO\) service, or your email address\. If you received an invitation email from another Amazon QuickSight user, it indicates what type of credentials to use\. 
   + For individual users – the user name you created for yourself\.

     This is usually the IAM credentials you created\. 

   User names that contain a semicolon \( ; \) aren't supported\.

1. Type the associated password in **Password**\. If you aren't sure, ask the administrator\. If you create a new password, there is a **Confirm password** field\. Type your password again\.

   Passwords are case\-sensitive, must be between 8 and 64 characters in length, and must contain at least one character from three of the following categories:
   + Lowercase letters \(a–z\)
   + Uppercase letters \(A–Z\)
   + Numbers \(0–9\)
   + Nonalphanumeric characters \(\~\!@\#$%^&\*\_\-\+=`\|\\\(\)\{\}\[\]:;"'<>,\.?/\)

1. Choose **Sign in**\. In some cases, this button is labeled **Create account and sign in**\.

1. \(Only for users invited by email\.\) You are prompted to type the account name provided in your email invitation\. If you mistype it, you get an authentication error\. To change the account name, choose the account name next to the **Account name**, and type in the correct one\. 

## Signing In to Amazon QuickSight Using an Identity Provider<a name="login-identity-provider"></a>

If your organization uses an identity provider, you must first sign in through the identity provider before you use Amazon QuickSight\. 

An identity provider supports single sign\-on \(SSO\) access\. This means you don't need to provide sign\-in information to Amazon QuickSight\. When you access Amazon QuickSight, you shouldn't see a sign\-in screen\. 

If you do see a sign\-in screen in this case, no credentials will work\. Before you can use Amazon QuickSight, you must sign in through your identity provider\.
