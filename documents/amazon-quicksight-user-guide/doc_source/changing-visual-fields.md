# Changing the Fields Used by a Visual in Amazon QuickSight<a name="changing-visual-fields"></a>

You can add or modify fields for a visual by using the **Fields list** pane, the field wells, or the on\-visual editors or drop targets on the visual\. 

The field wells, on\-visual editors, and drop targets available for a specific visual depends on the visual type selected\. Refer to the appropriate visual type topic in the [Working with Visual Types in Amazon QuickSight](working-with-visual-types.md) section for details\.

**Important**  
You can also change the data type and format of numeric fields by using field wells and on\-visual editors\. If you change a field in this way, it changes it for all visuals in the analysis, not just for the selected visual\. For more information about changing numeric field data types and formats, see [Modifying Data Set Fields in an Analysis](modifying-data-set-fields-in-an-analysis.md)\.
