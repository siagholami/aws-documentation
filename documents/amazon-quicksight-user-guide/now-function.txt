For database data sets that directly query the database, now returns the current date and time using the settings and format specified by the database server. For file and Salesforce data sets, now returns the UTC date and time, in the format yyyy-MM-ddTkk:mm:ss:SSSZ (for example, 2015-10-15T19:11:51:003Z). now is not supported for use with database data sets that use SPICE.
