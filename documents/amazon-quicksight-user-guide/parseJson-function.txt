parseJson
Use parseJson to extract values from a JSON object. 
In SPICE, you can use parseJson when you are preparing a data set, but not in calculated fields during analysis.
For direct query, you can use parseJson both during data preparation and analysis. The parseJson function applies to either strings or to JSON native data types, depending on the dialect, as shown in the following table.



Dialect
Type




PostgreSQL

Amazon Redshift

Microsoft SQL Server

Syntax
parseJson(fieldName, path)
Arguments
fieldName 
The field containing the JSON object that you want to parse.
path 
The path to the data element you want to parse from the JSON object. Valid path syntax includes:
 $ – Root object
 . – Child operator
 [ ] – Subscript operator for array
Return Type
String
Example
The following example evaluates incoming JSON to retrieve a value for item quantity. By using this during data preparation, you can create a table out of the JSON.
parseJson({jsonField}, “$.items.qty”)
The following shows the JSON.
{
    "customer": "John Doe",
    "items": {
        "product": "Beer",
        "qty": 6
    },
    "list1": [
        "val1",
        "val2"
    ],
    "list2": [
        {
            "list21key1": "list1value1"
        }
    ]
}
For this example, the following value is returned.
6
Example
The following example evaluates JSONObject1 to extract the first key value pair (KVP), labelled "State", and assign the value to the calculated field that you are creating.
parseJson(JSONObject1, “$.state”)
The following are the given field values.
```
JSONObject1

{"State":"New York","Product":"Produce","Date Sold":"1/16/2018","Sales Amount":"$3423.39"}

{"State":"Utah","Product":"Water","Date Sold":"4/24/2018","Sales Amount":"$7001.52"}
