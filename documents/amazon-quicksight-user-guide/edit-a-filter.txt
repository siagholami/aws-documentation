Editing a Filter
You can edit a filter by enabling or disabling the filter or changing the filter criteria. You can also edit a filter by changing the filter scope to include or exclude other visuals in the analysis that use the same data set.
You can't change the field a filter applies to. To apply a filter to a different field, create a new filter instead.

Changing Filter Scope
