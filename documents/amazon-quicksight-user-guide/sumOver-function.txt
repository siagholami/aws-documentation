     sum(Sales), 
     [City, State]
)
The following example sums Billed Amount over Customer Region. This example uses the revenue sample dataset, located in an Amazon S3 bucket. The fields in the table calculation are in the field wells of the visual.
sumOver(
     sum({Billed Amount}),
     [{Customer Region}]

The following screenshot shows the results of the example. With the addition of Customer Segment, the total amount billed for each is summed for the Customer Region, and displays in the calculated field.
