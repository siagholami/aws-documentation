Adding a Filter
You can create a filter on any field from the data set associated with the currently selected visual. If you want to create a filter for a different data set, choose a visual that uses that data set. When you create a filter, it applies by default to just the currently selected visual. You can apply the filter to additional visual that use that data set after you create it.
After you apply a filter to a visual, a filter icon appears on the top right of the visual, next to the v-shaped on-visual menu. This icon shows you at a glance that the data is filtered.

Depending on the data type of the field you choose, you see different filtering options, as described in the following topics. 
Topics
 Adding a Text Filter
 Adding a Numeric Filter
 Adding a Date Filter
 Adding a Compound Filter with And/Or Operators
