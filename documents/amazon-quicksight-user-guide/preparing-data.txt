Preparing Data
Data sets store any data preparation you have done on that data, so that you can reuse that prepared data in multiple analyses. Data preparation provides options such as adding calculated fields, applying filters, and changing field names or data types. If you are basing the data source on a SQL database, you can also use data preparation to join tables. Alternatively, you can enter a SQL query if you want to work with data from more than a single table.
If you want to transform the data from a data source before using it in Amazon QuickSight, you can prepare it to suit your needs and then save this preparation as part of the data set. 
You can prepare a data set when you create it, or by editing it later. For more information about creating a new data set and preparing it, see Creating Data Sets. For more information about opening an existing data set for data preparation, see Editing a Data Set.
