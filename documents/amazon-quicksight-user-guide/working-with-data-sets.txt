Working with Data Sets
A data set identifies the specific data in a data source that you want to use. For example, the data source might be a table if you are connecting to a database data source, or a file if you are connecting to an Amazon S3 data source. A data set also stores any data preparation you have performed on that data, such as renaming a field or changing its data type. Storing this preparation means that you don't have to reprepare the data each time you want to create an analysis based on it.
