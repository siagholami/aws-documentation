I Can't Connect to Amazon S3
To successfully connect to Amazon S3, you must configure authentication and create a valid manifest file inside the bucket you are trying to access. You also need to make sure that the file described by the manifest is available.
To verify authentication, make sure that you authorized Amazon QuickSight to access the S3 account. Itâ€™s not enough that you, the user, are authorized. Amazon QuickSight must be authorized separately. 
To authorize Amazon QuickSight to access your Amazon S3 bucket


In the AWS Region list at top right, choose the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You use this AWS Region temporarily while you edit your account permissions. 


Inside of Amazon QuickSight, choose your profile name (top right). Choose Manage QuickSight, and then choose Account Settings, on the left. 


On the Account Settings page, choose Edit AWS permissions. 


If Amazon S3 is selected, see how many buckets are authorized. 


To select individual buckets, choose Choose S3 buckets. Select the buckets you want to access from Amazon QuickSight. Then choose Select buckets.


Choose Apply.


If you changed your AWS Region during the first step of this process, change it back to the AWS Region you want to use.


We strongly recommend that you make sure that your manifest file is valid. If Amazon QuickSight can't parse your file, it gives you an error similar to "We can't parse the manifest file as a valid JSON" or "We can't connect to the S3 bucket."
To verify your manifest file


Open your manifest file. You can do this directly from the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/. Navigate to your manifest file and choose Open.


Make sure that the URI or URLs provided inside the manifest file indicate the file or files that you want connect to.


Make sure that your manifest file is formed correctly, if you use a link to the manifest file rather than uploading the file. The link shouldn't have any additional phrases after the word .json. You can get the correct link to an S3 file by viewing its Link value in the details on the S3 console.


Make sure that the content of the manifest file is valid by using a JSON validator, like the one at https://jsonlint.com. 


Verify permissions on your bucket or file. In the https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/, navigate to your Amazon S3 bucket, choose the Permissions tab, and add the appropriate permissions. Make sure that the permissions are at the right level, either on the bucket or on the file or files. 


If you are using the s3:// protocol, rather than https://, make sure that you reference your bucket directly. For example, use s3://mybucket/myfile.csv instead of s3://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mybucket/myfile.csv. Doubly specifying Amazon S3, by using s3:// and also s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com, causes an error.

In addition, verify that your Amazon S3 data set was created according to the steps in Creating a Data Set Using Amazon S3 Files.
