Deleting a Data Source
You can delete a data source if it is no longer necessary. Deleting a query-based database data source makes any associated data sets unusable. Deleting an Amazon S3, Salesforce, or SPICE-based database data source doesn't affect your ability to use any associated data sets, because the data is stored in SPICE. However, you can no longer refresh those data sets.
Use the following procedure to delete a data source.


In the FROM EXISTING DATA SOURCES section of the Create a Data Set page, choose the data source you want to delete.


Choose Delete.



Choose Yes.
