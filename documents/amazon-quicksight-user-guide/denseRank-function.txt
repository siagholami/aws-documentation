denseRank
denseRank calculates the rank of a measure or a dimension in comparison to the specified partitions. It counts each item only once, ignoring duplicates, and assigns a rank "without holes" so that duplicate values share the same rank. 
denseRank is supported for use with analyses based on SPICE and direct query data sets.
Syntax
The brackets are required. To see which arguments are optional, see the following descriptions.
denseRank
(
     [ sort_order_field ASC_or_DESC, ... ] 
     ,[ partition_field, ... ] 
)
Arguments
sort order field 
One or more aggregated fields, either measures or dimensions or both, that you want to sort the data by, separated by commas. You can either specify ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) sort order. 
Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).
partition field 
(Optional) One or more dimensions that you want to partition by, separated by commas. 
Each field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in [ ] (square brackets).
Example
The following example densely ranks max(Sales), based on a descending sort order, by State and City. Any cities with the same max(Sales) are assigned the same rank, and the next city is ranked consecutively after them. For example, if three cities share the same ranking, the fourth city is ranked as second.

     [max(Sales) DESC], 
     [State, City]

The following example densely ranks max(Sales), based on a descending sort order, by State. Any states with the same max(Sales) are assigned the same rank, and the next is ranked consecutively after them. For example, if three states share the same ranking, the fourth state is ranked as second.
