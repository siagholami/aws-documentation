Modifying Pivot Table Visuals
When you work with a pivot table, you can modify it in a number of ways to customize the visual to your needs. As with all visual types, you can add and remove fields, change the field associated with a visual element, change field aggregation, change date field granularity, and focus on or exclude rows or columns. For more information about how to make these changes to a pivot table, see the topics under Changing the Fields Used by a Visual in Amazon QuickSight.
There are also some ways to modify pivot tables that are exclusive to this visual type, as follows:
 Change the pivot table format to display by rows or by columns.
 Expand or collapse clustered rows or columns to show or hide subcategories.
 Sort the rows in the pivot table by the values in a selected column.
 Add table calculations (like rank or difference) to cell values.
