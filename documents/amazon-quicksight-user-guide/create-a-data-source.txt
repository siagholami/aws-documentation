Creating a Data Source
An associated data source is automatically created when you create an Amazon Athena, Amazon S3, Salesforce, or database data set. No data source is created when you create a data set by uploading a file.
 For information about creating an Amazon S3 data set, see Creating a Data Set Using Amazon S3 Files.
 For information about creating an Amazon Athena data set, see Creating a Data Set Using Amazon Athena Data.
 For information about creating a Salesforce data set, see Creating a Data Set from Salesforce.
 For information about creating a data set from a database, see Creating Data Sets from New Database Data Sources.
