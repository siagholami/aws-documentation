percentile
percentileRank calculates the percentile rank of a measure or a dimension in comparison to the specified partitions. The percentile rank value(x) indicates that the current item is above x% of values in the specified partition. The percentile rank value ranges from 0 (inclusive) to 100 (exclusive). 
percentileRank is supported for use with analyses based on SPICE and direct query data sets.

The following example does a percentile ranking of max(Sales) in descending order, by State. 
percentileRank
(
     [max(Sales) DESC], 
     [State]
)
The following example does a percentile ranking of Customer Region by total Billed Amount. This example uses the revenue sample data file, located in an Amazon S3 bucket. The fields in the table calculation are in the field wells of the visual.
percentileRank(
     [sum({Billed Amount}) DESC],
     [{Customer Region}]
)
The following screenshot shows the results of the example, along with the total Billed Amount so you can see how each region compares.
