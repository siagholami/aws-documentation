Working with Amazon QuickSight Visuals
A visual is a graphical representation of your data. You can create a wide variety of visuals in an analysis, using different data sets and visual types. 
After you have created a visual, you can modify it in a range of ways to customize it to your needs. Possible customizations include changing what fields map to visual elements, changing the visual type, sorting visual data, or applying a filter.
