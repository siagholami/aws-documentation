Required Permissions for Database Credentials
To connect to a database, you must provide a user name and password. The user account identified by these credentials must have SELECT permissions on some system tables in order to allow Amazon QuickSight to do things like discover table schemas and estimate table size. 
The following table identifies the tables that the user account must have SELECT permissions on, depending on the type of database you are connecting to. These requirements apply for all database instances you connect to, regardless of their environmentâ€”that is, whether they are on-premises, in Amazon RDS, in Amazon EC2, or elsewhere.
