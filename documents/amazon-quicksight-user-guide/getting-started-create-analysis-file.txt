Step 1: Create a File Data Set and an Analysis
Complete the following procedure to create a data set and an analysis:


Check Data Source Limits to make sure your target file doesn't exceed data source limits.


On the Amazon QuickSight start page, choose Manage data.


On the Your Data Sets page, choose New data set.


In the FROM NEW DATA SOURCES section of the Create a Data Set page, choose Upload a file.


In the Open dialog box, browse to a text file, select it, and then choose Open.


A file must be 1 GB or less to be uploaded to Amazon QuickSight.


Choose Next.


Choose Visualize.


Step 2: Create a Visual
Next, create a visual.
In the Fields list pane of the analysis page, choose the fields you want to use.
Amazon QuickSight creates the visual, using AutoGraph to determine the most appropriate visual type for the fields you selected. For more information about AutoGraph, see Using AutoGraph. For more information about modifying the visual, see Working with Amazon QuickSight Visuals.
