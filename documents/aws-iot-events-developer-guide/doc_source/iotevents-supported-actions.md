AWS IoT Events can trigger actions when it detects a specified event or transition event\. You can define built\-in actions to use a timer or set a variable, or send data to other AWS resources\.

**Note**  
When you define an action in a detector model, you can use expressions for parameters that are string data type\. For more information, see [Expressions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotevents/latest/developerguide/iotevents-expressions.html)\.
