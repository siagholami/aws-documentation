# Logging AWS IoT Events API calls with AWS CloudTrail<a name="iotevents-using-cloudtrail"></a>

AWS IoT Events is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in AWS IoT Events\. CloudTrail captures all API calls for AWS IoT Events as events, including calls from the AWS IoT Events console and from code calls to the AWS IoT Events APIs\. 

If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for AWS IoT Events\. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in **Event history**\. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to AWS IoT Events, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details\.

To learn more about CloudTrail, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)\.

## AWS IoT Events information in CloudTrail<a name="aws-iotevents-info-in-cloudtrail"></a>

CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account\. When activity occurs in AWS IoT Events, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event with other AWS service events in **Event history**\. You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account\. For more information, see [Viewing events with CloudTrail event history](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.html)\. 

For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for AWS IoT Events, create a trail\. A trail enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an Amazon S3 bucket\. By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all AWS Regions\. The trail logs events from all Regions in the AWS partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act on the event data collected in CloudTrail logs\. For more information, see:

Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request\. The identity information helps you determine the following: 
+ Whether the request was made with root or IAM user credentials\.
+ Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a role or federated user\.
+ Whether the request was made by another AWS service\.

For more information, see the [CloudTrail userIdentity element](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.html)\. AWS IoT Events actions are documented in the [AWS IoT Events API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotevents/latest/apireference/Welcome.html)\.
