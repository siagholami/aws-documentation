Monitoring tools
AWS provides various tools that you can use to monitor AWS IoT Events. You can configure some of these tools to do the monitoring for you, while some of the tools require manual intervention. We recommend that you automate monitoring tasks as much as possible.
Automated monitoring tools
You can use the following automated monitoring tools to watch AWS IoT Events and report when something is wrong:
 Amazon CloudWatch Logs – Monitor, store, and access your log files from AWS CloudTrail or other sources. For more information, see Monitoring log files in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
 Amazon CloudWatch Events – Match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams to make changes, capture state information, and take corrective action. For more information, see What is Amazon CloudWatch Events in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
 AWS CloudTrail Log Monitoring – Share log files between accounts, monitor CloudTrail log files in real time by sending them to CloudWatch Logs, write log-processing applications in Java, and validate that your log files have not changed after delivery by CloudTrail. For more information, see Working with CloudTrail log files in the AWS CloudTrail User Guide. 
Manual monitoring tools
Another important part of monitoring AWS IoT Events involves manually monitoring those items that the CloudWatch alarms don't cover. The AWS IoT Events, CloudWatch, and other AWS console dashboards provide an at-a-glance view of the state of your AWS environment. We recommend that you also check the log files on AWS IoT Events.
 The AWS IoT Events console shows:
   Detector models
   Detectors
   Inputs
   Settings
 The CloudWatch home page shows:
   Current alarms and status
   Graphs of alarms and resources
   Service health status
In addition, you can use CloudWatch to do the following: 
   Create customized dashboards to monitor the services you care about
   Graph metric data to troubleshoot issues and discover trends
   Search and browse all your AWS resource metrics
   Create and edit alarms to be notified of problems
