Managing the Session Name
You can change the name of a running session at any time. Session names enable you to quickly identify a specific session based on the name that you've assigned to it. Session names don't need to be unique across running sessions.
To change the name of a running session
Use the dcv set-name command. For session, specify the ID of the session for which to change the name, and for name, specify the name for the session. The session name can be any string of up to 256 characters. If the specified string exceeds 256 characters, the command fails.
$ dcv set-name --session session-id --name "session-name"
To remove the name from a running session
Use the dcv set-name command. For session, specify the ID of the session from which to remove the name, and include the --none parameter.
$ dcv set-name --session session-id --none
Examples

Example 2—Removing a session's name
The following example removes the name of a session with an ID of my-session.
