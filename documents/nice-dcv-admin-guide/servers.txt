Requirements
For a good user experience with NICE DCV, ensure that your server meets the following minimum requirements. Keep in mind that your users' experience is largely dependent on the number of pixels streamed from the NICE DCV server to the NICE DCV client.
If you are installing the NICE DCV server on an Amazon EC2 instance, we recommend that you use an Amazon EC2 G3 or G4 instance type. These instance types offer NVIDIA GPUs that support hardware-based OpenGL and GPU sharing. For more information, see Amazon EC2 G3 Instances and Amazon EC2 G4 Instances. You can install the NICE DCV server on any other instance type, but there might be screen resolution limitations. A third-party driver can be used to bypass this limitation. If you need the third-party driver, request it from NICE Support.
Your server must meet the minimum requirements listed in the following table.
