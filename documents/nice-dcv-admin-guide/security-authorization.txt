Configuring NICE DCV Authorization
Authorization is used to grant or deny NICE DCV clients permissions to specific NICE DCV features. In NICE DCV, authorization is configured using a permissions file. The permissions file defines the NICE DCV features to which users have access when they connect to a session.
NICE DCV supports two types of permissions files:

 Default Permissions File
 Custom Permissions File
 Working with Permissions Files
Default Permissions File
The default permissions file is used for all sessions if you do not specify a custom permissions file when creating a session. The default permissions file grants only the session owner full access to all features.
You can customize the default permissions file to include custom authorizations. The default permissions file is located in C:\Program Files\NICE\DCV\Server\conf\default.perm on Windows NICE DCV servers and /etc/dcv/default.perm on Linux NICE DCV servers.
For information about customizing the default permissions file, see Working with Permissions Files.
Custom Permissions File
A custom permissions file lets you explicitly define the features that specific users or groups have access to when they connect to a NICE DCV session. When you use a custom permissions file, you override the default permissions file.
To use a custom permissions file, you must first create the permissions file. Next, specify it when you start the session using the --permissions-file option with the dcv create-session command. For more information about starting sessions, see Starting NICE DCV Sessions.
