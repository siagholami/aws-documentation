Enabling Touchscreen and Stylus Support
Touchscreen is supported with all of the supported Windows operating systems. Stylus is supported with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019 only. The features are enabled by default on Windows NICE DCV servers. No additional configuration is required.
Touchscreen and stylus are supported with all of the supported Linux operating systems. The features are enabled by default on virtual sessions hosted on Linux NICE DCV servers. However, some additional configuration is required to enable the features on console sessions hosted on Linux NICE DCV servers.
To enable touchscreen and stylus support for console sessions hosted on a Linux NICE DCV server


Open /etc/X11/xorg.conf using your preferred text editor.


Add the following sections to the file.


```
   Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier "DCV Stylus Pen"
     Driver "dcvinput"
   EndSection
Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier "DCV Stylus Eraser"
     Driver "dcvinput"
   EndSection
Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier "DCV Touchscreen"
     Driver "dcvinput"
   EndSection
   ```

Add the following to the end of the ServerLayout section.

InputDevice  "DCV Stylus Pen"
   InputDevice  "DCV Stylus Eraser"
   InputDevice  "DCV Touchscreen"
For example:
Section "ServerLayout"
     ...existing content...
     InputDevice  "DCV Stylus Pen"
     InputDevice  "DCV Stylus Eraser"
     InputDevice  "DCV Touchscreen"
   EndSection


Save the changes and close the file.


Restart the X server.
    RHEL 7.x, CentOs 7.x, Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu 18.x, and SUSE Linux Enterprise 12.x
$ sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target
$ sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
    RHEL 6.x and CentOs 6.x
$ sudo init 3

To ensure that the input devices are properly configured, run the following command.


$ sudo DISPLAY=:0 xinput
