# Setting Up the NICE DCV Server<a name="setting-up"></a>

To use NICE DCV, install the NICE DCV server software on the server where you intend to host NICE DCV sessions and ensure that it is properly licensed\.

The following topics explain how to install and license the NICE DCV server\. The [Licensing](setting-up-license.md) topic applies to installations on on\-premises and alternative cloud\-based servers only, because you don't need a license to use the NICE DCV server on an Amazon EC2 instance\.
