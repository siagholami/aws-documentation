# Use External Authentication<a name="external-authentication"></a>

By default, NICE DCV client authentication is delegated to the underlying operating system\. With Windows NICE DCV servers, authentication is delegated to WinLogon\. With Linux NICE DCV servers, authentication is delegated to Linux PAM\.

You can configure NICE DCV to use an external authentication server to authenticate clients\. This enables you to use an existing authentication system\. With external authentication, NICE DCV leverages your existing login mechanisms and delegates authentication to an external authentication server\. 

In order to use an external authentication server, you must have the following in place:
+ **A login mechanism**—This is the front\-end mechanism that your users use to log in\. It should be able to verify your users by using your existing credentials verification system and it should be able to generate a token and provide it to the NICE DCV server\. For more information, see [Using the Token](#using-token)\.
+ **An authentication server**—This is the server that authenticates the token generated by the login mechanism\. This server should be able to receive an HTTP\(S\) POST request from the NICE DCV server that includes the token, perform the necessary authentications, and then send the response back to the NICE DCV server\. For more information about implementing an authentication server, see [Authentication service requirements](#configure-authenticator)\.
+ **NICE DCV Server configuration**—The NICE DCV server must be configured to use an external authentication server\. For more information, see [NICE DCV Server Configuration](#configure-server)\.

## NICE DCV Server Configuration<a name="configure-server"></a>

You must configure the NICE DCV server to use the external authentication service\.

**To specify an external authentication server on Linux**

1. Navigate to `/etc/dcv/` and open the `dcv.conf` with your preferred text editor\.

1. Locate the `auth-token-verifier` parameter in the `[security]` section, and replace the existing value with the URL of the external authentication server and the port over which to communicate, in the following format: `url:port`\. For example, if you're using the DcvSimpleExternalAuthenticator, specify the following: `http://127.0.0.1:8444`\.

   If there is no `auth-token-verifier` parameter in the `[security]` section, add it manually using the following format:

   ```
   [security] 
   auth-token-verifier=url:port
   ```

1. Save and close the file\.

## Using the Token<a name="using-token"></a>

Once you have generated the token, you must be able to send it to the NICE DCV server\. With the web browser client, append the token to the connection URL as follows:

```
https://server_hostname_or_IP:port/#session_id?authToken=token
```

For example:

```
https://my-dcv-server.com:8443/#my-session?authToken=1234567890abcdef
```

## Authentication service requirements<a name="configure-authenticator"></a>

Your custom authentication service can run on the same host of the NICE DCV server or it can run on a separate host\. The authentication service must listen for HTTP\(S\) POST requests from the NICE DCV server\.

The following shows the POST request format used by the NICE DCV server\.

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
sessionId=session_id&authenticationToken=token&clientAddress=client_address
```

Your authentication service is responsible for determining whether the supplied token is valid\.

After the token is validated, the authentication server must return the response to the NICE DCV server\. The response body must include one of the following, depending on the outcome of the authentication process:
+ If authentication is successful, the authentication service returns a result of `yes` and a user identifier\. For example:

  ```
  <auth result="yes"><username>username</username></auth>
  ```
+ If authentication is unsuccessful, the authentication service returns a result of `no`\. For example:

  ```
  <auth result="no"/>
  ```

### DcvSimpleExternalAuthenticator<a name="simple-auth"></a>

NICE DCV ships with a reference external authentication server called, `DcvSimpleExternalAuthenticator`\. DcvSimpleExternalAuthenticator is a single Python script that you can use a starting point for creating your own custom authentication server\.

DcvSimpleExternalAuthenticator server supports HTTP and HTTPS, and it must run on the same server on which the NICE DCV server is installed\. By default, the DcvSimpleExternalAuthenticator listens for requests on port `8444`\. You can change the port, if needed\. To do this, open `/etc/dcv/simpleextauth.conf` with your preferred text editor, locate the `EXTAUTH_PORT` parameter, and replace the existing value with the required port number\.

To use DcvSimpleExternalAuthenticator, you must install the `nice-dcv-simple-external-authenticator` package\. For more information, see [Install the NICE DCV Server](setting-up-installing-linux-server.md#linux-server-install)\.

To start the DcvSimpleExternalAuthenticator after installing it, run the following command:

```
$ dcvsimpleextauth start-server
```
