Managing NICE DCV Session Authorization
Authorization is used to grant or deny NICE DCV clients permissions to specific NICE DCV features. Typically, authorization is configured when a NICE DCV session is started. However, it is possible to edit the permissions for a running session. For more information about NICE DCV authorization, see Configuring NICE DCV Authorization.
To modify the permissions for a running session
Use the dcv set-permissions command. The following options can be used with the dcv set-permissions command.
--session
Specifies the ID of the session for which to set the permissions.
--reset-builtin
Resets the session's permissions to the default session permissions. The default permissions grants only the session owner full access to all features.
--none
Revokes all permissions for the session.
--file
Specifies the path to a custom permissions file. If the specified file is empty, all permissions are revoked. For more information about creating a custom permissions file, see Working with Permissions Files.
