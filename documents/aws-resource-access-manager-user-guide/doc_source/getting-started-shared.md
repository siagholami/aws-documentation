## Respond to the Resource Share Invitation<a name="getting-started-shared-respond-invitation"></a>

If you receive an invitation to join a resource share, you must accept it to gain access to the shared resources\. If you are part of an organization in AWS Organizations and sharing within your organization is enabled, principals in your organization are automatically granted access to the shared resources and do not receive these invitations\.

**To respond to invitations**

1. Open the AWS RAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ram](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Shared with me**, **Resource shares**\.

1. Review the list of resource shares to which you have been added\.

   The **Status** column indicates your current participation status for the resource share\. The `Pending` status indicates that you have been added to a resource share, but you have not yet accepted or rejected the invitation\.

1. To respond to the resource share invitation, select the resource share ID and choose **Accept resource share** to accept the invitation, or **Reject resource share** to decline the invitation\. If you reject the invitation, you do not get access to the resources\. If you accept the invitation, you gain access to the resources\.

## Use the Resources that are Shared with You<a name="getting-started-shared-use-resources"></a>

After you accept the invitation to join a resource share, you gain the ability to perform specific actions on the shared resources\. These actions vary by resource type\. For more information, see [Shareable Resources](shareable.md)\.
