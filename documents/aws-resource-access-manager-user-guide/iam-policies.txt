How AWS RAM Works with IAM
By default, IAM users don't have permission to create or modify AWS RAM resources. To allow IAM users to create or modify resources and perform tasks, you must create IAM policies that grant permission to use specific resources and API actions. You then attach those policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions.

 Policy Structure
Policy Structure
An IAM policy is a JSON document that includes the following statements: Effect, Action, Resource, and Condition. An IAM policy typically takes the following form:
{
        "Statement":[{
            "Effect":"effect",
            "Action":"action",
            "Resource":"arn",
            "Condition":{
                "condition":{
                    "key":"value"
                }
            }
        }]
    }
Effect
The Effect statement indicates whether the policy allows or denies a user permission to perform an action. The possible values include: Allow and Deny.
Action
The Action statement specifies the AWS RAM API actions for which the policy is allowing or denying permission. For a complete list of the allowed actions, see  Actions Defined by AWS Resource Access Manager in the IAM User Guide.
Resource
The Resource statement specifies the AWS RAM resources that are affected by the policy. To specify a resource in the statement, you need to use its unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For a complete list of the allowed resources, see  Resources Defined by AWS Resource Access Manager in the IAM User Guide.
Condition
Condition statements are optional. They can be used to further refine the conditions under which the policy applies. AWS RAM supports the following condition keys:
 aws:RequestTag/${TagKey} — Specifies a tag key and value pair that must be used when creating or tagging a resource share. 
 aws:ResourceTag/${TagKey} — Indicates that the action can be performed only on resources that have the specified tag key and value pair.
 aws:TagKeys — Specifies the tag keys that can be used when creating or tagging a resource share.
 ram:AllowsExternalPrincipals — Indicates that the action can be performed only on resource shares that allow or deny sharing with external principals. An external principal is an AWS account outside of your AWS organization
 ram:Principal — Indicates that the action can be performed only on the specified principal.
 ram:RequestedResourceType — Indicates that the action can be performed only on the specified resource type. Resource types must be specified in the following format: 
   aws:RequestTag/${TagKey} — Specifies a tag key and value pair that must be used when creating or tagging a resource share. 
   aws:ResourceTag/${TagKey} — Indicates that the action can be performed only on resources that have the specified tag key and value pair.
   aws:TagKeys — Specifies the tag keys that can be used when creating or tagging a resource share.
   ram:AllowsExternalPrincipals — Indicates that the action can be performed only on resource shares that allow or deny sharing with external principals. An external principal is an AWS account outside of your AWS organization
   ram:Principal — Indicates that the action can be performed only on the specified principal.
   ram:RequestedResourceType — Indicates that the action can be performed only on the specified resource type. Resource types must be specified in the following format:

       rds:Cluster

   ram:ResourceArn — Indicates that the action can be performed only on a resource with the specified ARN.
   ram:ResourceShareName — Indicates that the action can be performed only on a resource share with the specified name.
   ram:ShareOwnerAccountId — Indicates that the action can be performed only on resource shares owned by a specific account.
 ram:ResourceArn — Indicates that the action can be performed only on a resource with the specified ARN.
 ram:ResourceShareName — Indicates that the action can be performed only on a resource share with the specified name.
 ram:ShareOwnerAccountId — Indicates that the action can be performed only on resource shares owned by a specific account.
