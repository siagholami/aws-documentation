Using Shared Resources
To start using shared resources, do the following:
 Respond to the Resource Share Invitation
 Use the Resources that are Shared with You
Respond to the Resource Share Invitation
If you receive an invitation to join a resource share, you must accept it to gain access to the shared resources. If you are part of an organization in AWS Organizations and sharing within your organization is enabled, principals in your organization are automatically granted access to the shared resources and do not receive these invitations.
To respond to invitations


Open the AWS RAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram.


In the navigation pane, choose Shared with me, Resource shares.


Review the list of resource shares to which you have been added.


The Status column indicates your current participation status for the resource share. The Pending status indicates that you have been added to a resource share, but you have not yet accepted or rejected the invitation.

To respond to the resource share invitation, select the resource share ID and choose Accept resource share to accept the invitation, or Reject resource share to decline the invitation. If you reject the invitation, you do not get access to the resources. If you accept the invitation, you gain access to the resources.

Use the Resources that are Shared with You
After you accept the invitation to join a resource share, you gain the ability to perform specific actions on the shared resources. These actions vary by resource type. For more information, see Shareable Resources.
