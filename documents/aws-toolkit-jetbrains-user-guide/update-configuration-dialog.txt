Update Configuration dialog box
The Update Configuration dialog box in the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains is displayed whenever you change (update) the configuration for an AWS Lambda function.

The Update Configuration dialog box contains the following items.
Name
Required. The function's name. Can contain only the uppercase letters A through Z, the lowercase letters a through z, the numbers 0 through 9, the hyphen character (-), and the underscore character (_). This name must be less than 64 characters in length.
Description
Optional. Any meaningful description about the function. 
Handler
Required. The identifier of the corresponding Java, Python, Node.js, or C#. 
Runtime
Required. The identifier of the runtime for Lambda to use.
Timeout (seconds)
Required. The amount of time that Lambda allows a function to run before stopping it. Specify an amount of up to 900 seconds (15 minutes).
Memory (MB)
Required. The amount of memory available to the function during its execution. Specify an amount between 128 MB and 3,008 MB in 64-MB increments.
Environment Variables
Optional. Any environment variables for the function to use, specified as key-value pairs. To add, change, or delete environment variables, choose the folder icon, and then follow the on-screen instructions.
IAM Role
Required. Choose an available Lambda execution role in the connected AWS account for Lambda to use for the function. To create an execution role in the account and have Lambda use that one instead, choose Create, and then follow the on-screen instructions. For more information, see AWS Lambda Execution Role in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide.
Enable AWS X-Ray
Optional. If selected, Lambda enables AWS X-Ray to detect, analyze, and optimize performance issues with the function. X-Ray collects metadata from the Lambda service and any upstream or downstream services that make up your function. X-Ray uses this metadata to generate a detailed service graph that shows performance bottlenecks, latency spikes, and other issues that impact the performance of your function. For more information, see Using AWS X-Ray in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide.
