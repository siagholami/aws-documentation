Working with Amazon S3 buckets by using the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains
Every object you store in Amazon S3 resides in a bucket. You can use buckets to group related objects in the same way that you use a directory to group files in a file system.

Creating an Amazon S3 bucket


Open AWS Explorer, if it isn't already open.


Right-click the Amazon S3 node and choose Create S3 Bucket.



In the Create S3 Bucket dialog box, enter a name for the bucket.
Note
Because Amazon S3 allows your bucket to be used as a URL that can be accessed publicly, the bucket name that you choose must be globally unique. If some other account has already created a bucket with the name that you chose, you must use another name. For more information, see Bucket Restrictions and Limitations in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.


Choose Create.

Deleting an Amazon S3 bucket


Open AWS Explorer, if it isn't already.

    If the bucket contains objects, the bucket is emptied before deletion. A notification is displayed after the deletion is complete.
