Installing the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains
Installing the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains is a two-stage process. First, you configure your AWS account and permissions so you can interact with AWS services within the JetBrains IDE. Next, you install and configure the Toolkit as an IDE plugin.

Setting up your AWS account to use AWS Toolkit for JetBrains


Create an AWS account, if you don't have an account already.


Create an administrator user and group in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) in the account, if you haven't done that already. 
Note
We recommend that you create or use a special type of user and group in the account for the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains to use, which we call an administrator IAM user and group. Although you can create a regular IAM user and group in the account for the toolkit to use, this approach might not allow the toolkit to have full access to all of the AWS resources and AWS serverless applications in that account. We support, but strongly discourage, using an AWS account root user with the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains.


Create an access key for the user, if you don't have an access key for that user already. 
Note
An access key contains both an access key ID value and a secret access key value. The AWS Toolkit for JetBrains needs to use both of these values later. Be sure to store them in a secure location. If you lose them, they're gone forever and can't be retrieved. However, you can always delete a lost access key, and then create a replacement access key. If you ever do this, you also need to change your toolkit connection settings. We support, but strongly discourage, creating an access key for an AWS account root user for the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains to use.


Installing and configuring AWS Toolkit for JetBrains


Ensure that a JetBrains IDE supported by AWS Toolkits is installed and running.


Open Settings / Preferences.


Choose Plugins.


On the Marketplace tab, in Search plugins in marketplace, begin entering AWS Toolkit. When AWS Toolkit by Amazon Web Services is displayed, choose it.



Choose Install.

Note
To use the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains to work with its available features for AWS CloudFormation, AWS Lambda, AWS Serverless, and Amazon ECS, you must install version 1.8 or later of the AWS Toolkit.


When the Third-party Plugins Privacy Note is displayed, choose Accept.


Choose Restart IDE, and when prompted, choose Restart.


Before you can use the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains to develop, test, analyze, and deploy AWS serverless applications or Lambda functions, be sure you have the following tools installed. Install the tools in this order:


AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)


Docker (Docker must always be running whenever you develop, test, analyze, or deploy serverless applications or functions)


AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI)


Before you can use the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains to debug code in Amazon ECS clusters, you must complete additional steps. For instructions, see the prerequisites.


After you install the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains (and, if you're working with AWS serverless applications, Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS clusters, you've installed the preceding additional required tools, in order), connect to an AWS account for the first time.


Installing AWS Toolkit for JetBrains Early Access Program (EAP) builds
AWS occasionally releases AWS Toolkit for JetBrains preview and experimental plugins and features through Early Access Program (EAP) builds.
You can automatically get updated EAP builds as they become available, as follows.


Make sure a JetBrains IDE supported by AWS Toolkits is running.


Open Settings / Preferences.


Choose Plugins.


Choose Manage Repositories, Configure Proxy or Install Plugin from Disk (the settings icon).


Choose Manage Plugin Repositories.


Choose Add (the  icon).


Enter the following URL to the EAP repository for the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/aws.toolkit. Then press Enter, and choose OK.


If prompted, choose Restart IDE. Then when prompted, choose Restart.
    Now, whenever a later EAP build is available, choose Update next to the AWS Toolkit entry in Plugins. When prompted, choose Restart IDE. Then choose Restart.


To remove a reference to the custom repository, in the Preferences dialog box, choose Plugins. Then choose Manage Repositories, Configure Proxy or Install Plugin from Disk (the settings icon), Manage Plugin Repositories. Select the URL to the custom repository, and then choose Remove (the - icon). Then choose OK.
