Run/Debug Configurations dialog box
The Run/Debug Configurations dialog box in the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains is displayed whenever you change (update) the configuration for an AWS Lambda function.
This dialog box contains different configuration settings for the Lambda function, depending on whether you are changing (updating) settings for the local version of the function (the function's source code is on the local computer) or the remote version of that same function (the function's source code is within the Lambda service for the account).

Run/Debug Configurations dialog box (local function settings)
This dialog box is displayed whenever you change (update) settings for the local version of an AWS Lambda function (the function's source code is on the local computer).
Note
To change (update) settings for the remote version of that same function (the function's source code is within the Lambda service for the account), see Run/Debug Configurations dialog box (remote function settings) instead.
This dialog box contains two tabs: Configuration and SAM CLI.

The Configuration tab of the Run/Debug Configurations dialog box for local function settings contains the following items.
Name
Required. The name of this configuration.
Share / Share through VCS
Optional. If selected, makes this configuration available to other team members. 1
Allow parallel run / Allow running in parallel 
Optional. If selected, allows IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, or JetBrains Rider to launch as many instances of the configuration to run in parallel as needed. 1
From template
Required. The location and file name of the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template (for example, template.yaml) to use for this configuration, and the resource in that template to associate with this configuration.
Runtime
Required. The identifier of the runtime for Lambda to use.
Handler
Required. The identifier of the corresponding function handler for Java, Python, Node.js, or Node.js.
Environment Variables
Optional. Any environment variables for the AWS Lambda function to use, specified as key-value pairs. To add, change, or delete environment variables, choose the folder icon, and then follow the on-screen instructions.
Credentials
Required. The name of the existing AWS account connection to use.
Region
Required. The name of the AWS Region to use for the connected account.
File
Either File or Text is required (but not both). The location and file name of the event data to pass into the function, expressed in JSON format. For event data examples, see Invoke the Lambda Function in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide and Generating Sample Event Payloads in the AWS Serverless Application Model Developer Guide.
Text
Either File or Text is required (but not both). The event data to pass into the function, expression in JSON format. For event data examples, see Invoke the Lambda Function in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide and Generating Sample Event Payloads in the AWS Serverless Application Model Developer Guide.
Before launch: Activate tool window
Optional. Lists any tasks that must be performed before starting this configuration. 2
Show this page
Optional. If selected, displays these configuration settings before starting this configuration. 2

Build function inside a container
Optional. If selected, the AWS SAM CLI builds any of the serverless application's functions inside of an AWS Lambda-like Docker container locally before deployment. This is useful if the function depends on packages that have natively compiled dependencies or programs. For more information, see Building Applications with Dependencies in the AWS Serverless Application Model Developer Guide.
Skip checking for newer container images
Optional. If selected, the AWS SAM CLI skips pulling down the latest Docker image for the runtime that is specified on the Configuration tab.
Docker Network
Optional. The name or ID of an existing Docker network that Lambda Docker containers should connect to, with the default bridge network. If not specified, the Lambda containers connect only to the default bridge Docker network.

Run/Debug Configurations dialog box (remote function settings)
This dialog box displays whenever you change (update) settings for the remote version of an AWS Lambda function (the function's source code is within the Lambda service for the account).
Note
To change (update) settings for the local version of that same function (the function's source code is on the local computer), see Run/Debug Configurations dialog box (local function settings) instead.
Although the name of the dialog box is Run/Debug Configurations, you cannot use the AWS Toolkit to debug the remote version of a Lambda function. You can only run it.

The Run/Debug Configurations dialog box for remote function settings contains the following items.
Name
Required. The name of this configuration.
Share / Share through VCS
Optional. If selected, makes this configuration available to other team members. 1
Allow parallel run / Allow running in parallel
