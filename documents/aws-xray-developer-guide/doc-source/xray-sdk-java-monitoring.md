# AWS X\-Ray metrics for the X\-Ray SDK for Java<a name="xray-sdk-java-monitoring"></a>

This topic describes the AWS X\-Ray namespace, metrics, and dimensions\. You can use the X\-Ray SDK for Java to publish unsampled Amazon CloudWatch metrics from your collected X\-Ray segments\. These metrics are derived from the segmentâ€™s start and end time, and the error, fault, and throttled status flags\. Use these trace metrics to expose retries and dependency issues within subsegments\. 

CloudWatch is essentially a metrics repository\. A metric is the fundamental concept in CloudWatch and represents a time\-ordered set of data points\. You \(or AWS services\) publish metrics data points into CloudWatch and you retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time\-series data\. 

Metrics are uniquely defined by a name, a namespace, and one or more dimensions\. Each data point has a timestamp and, optionally, a unit of measure\. When you request statistics, the returned data stream is identified by namespace, metric name, and dimension\. 

For more information about CloudWatch, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/)\. 

## X\-Ray CloudWatch metrics<a name="xray-sdk-java-monitoring-metrics"></a>

The `ServiceMetrics/SDK` namespace includes the following metrics\.


| Metric | Statistics available | Description | Units | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  `Latency`  |  Average, Minimum, Maximum, Count  |  The difference between the start and end time\. Average, minimum, and maximum all describe operational latency\. Count describes call count\.  |  Milliseconds  | 
|  `ErrorRate`  |  Average, Sum  |  The rate of requests that failed with a `4xx Client Error` status code, resulting in an error\.  |  Percent  | 
|  `FaultRate`  |  Average, Sum  |  The rate of traces that failed with a `5xx Server Error` status code, resulting in a fault\.  |  Percent  | 
|  `ThrottleRate`  |  Average, Sum  |  The rate of throttled traces that return a `419` status code\. This is a subset of the `ErrorRate` metric\.   |  Percent  | 
|  `OkRate`  |  Average, Sum  |  The rate of traced requests resulting in an `OK` status code\.   |  Percent  | 

## X\-Ray CloudWatch dimensions<a name="xray-sdk-java-monitoring-dimensions"></a>

Use the dimensions in the following table to refine the metrics returned for your X\-Ray instrumented Java applications\.


| Dimension | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `ServiceType`  |  The type of the service, for example, `AWS::EC2::Instance` or `NONE`, if not known\.  | 
|  `ServiceName`  |  The canonical name for the service\.  | 

## Enable X\-Ray CloudWatch metrics<a name="xray-sdk-java-monitoring-enable"></a>

Use the following procedure to enable trace metrics in your instrumented Java application\.

**To configure trace metrics**

1. Add the `aws-xray-recorder-sdk-metrics` package as a Maven dependency\. For more information, see [X\-Ray SDK for Java Submodules](xray-sdk-java.md#xray-sdk-java-submodules)\.

1. Enable a new `MetricsSegmentListener()` as part of the global recorder build\.  
**Example src/com/myapp/web/Startup\.java**  

   ```
   import com.amazonaws.xray.AWSXRay;
   import com.amazonaws.xray.AWSXRayRecorderBuilder;
   import com.amazonaws.xray.plugins.EC2Plugin;
   import com.amazonaws.xray.plugins.ElasticBeanstalkPlugin;
   import com.amazonaws.xray.strategy.sampling.LocalizedSamplingStrategy;
   
   @Configuration
   public class WebConfig {
   ...
     static {
       AWSXRayRecorderBuilder builder = AWSXRayRecorderBuilder
                                           .standard()
                                           .withPlugin(new EC2Plugin())
                                           .withPlugin(new ElasticBeanstalkPlugin())
                                           .withSegmentListener(new MetricsSegmentListener());
   
       URL ruleFile = WebConfig.class.getResource("/sampling-rules.json");
       builder.withSamplingStrategy(new LocalizedSamplingStrategy(ruleFile));
   
       AWSXRay.setGlobalRecorder(builder.build());
     }
   }
   ```

1. Deploy the CloudWatch agent to collect metrics using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\), Amazon Elastic Container Service \(Amazon ECS\), or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(Amazon EKS\):
   +  To configure Amazon EC2, see [Deploying the CloudWatch Agent and the X\-Ray Daemon on Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy_servicelens_CloudWatch_agent_deploy_EC2.html)\.
   +  To configure Amazon ECS, see [Deploying the CloudWatch Agent and the X\-Ray Daemon on Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy_servicelens_CloudWatch_agent_deploy_ECS.html)\.
   +  To configure Amazon EKS, see [Deploying the CloudWatch Agent and the X\-Ray Daemon on Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy_servicelens_CloudWatch_agent_deploy_EKS.html)\.

1. Configure the SDK to communicate with the CloudWatch agent\. By default, the SDK communicates with the CloudWatch agent on the address `127.0.0.1`\. You can configure alternate addresses by setting the environment variable or Java property to `address:port`\.  
**Example Environment variable**  

   ```
   AWS_XRAY_METRICS_DAEMON_ADDRESS=address:port
   ```  
**Example Java property**  

   ```
   com.amazonaws.xray.metrics.daemonAddress=address:port
   ```

**To validate configuration**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Open the **Metrics** tab to observe the influx of your metrics\. 

1. \(Optional\) In the CloudWatch console, on the **Logs** tab, open the `ServiceMetricsSDK` log group\. Look for a log stream that matches the host metrics, and confirm the log messages\.
