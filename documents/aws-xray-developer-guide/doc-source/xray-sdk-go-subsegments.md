# Generating custom subsegments with the X\-Ray SDK for Go<a name="xray-sdk-go-subsegments"></a>

Subsegments extend a trace's [segment](xray-concepts.md#xray-concepts-segments) with details about work done in order to serve a request\. Each time you make a call with an instrumented client, the X\-Ray SDK records the information generated in a subsegment\. You can create additional subsegments to group other subsegments, to measure the performance of a section of code, or to record annotations and metadata\.

Use the `Capture` method to create a subsegment around a function\.

**Example main\.go â€“ Custom subsegment**  

```
func criticalSection(ctx context.Context) {
  //this is an example of a subsegment
  xray.Capture(ctx, "GameModel.saveGame", func(ctx1 context.Context) error {
    var err error

    section.Lock()
    result := someLockedResource.Go()
    section.Unlock()

    xray.AddMetadata(ctx1, "ResourceResult", result)
  })
```

The following screenshot shows an example of how the `saveGame` subsegment might appear in traces for the application `Scorekeep`\.
