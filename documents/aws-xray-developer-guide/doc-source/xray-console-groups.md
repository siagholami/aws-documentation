# Configuring groups in the X\-Ray console<a name="xray-console-groups"></a>

Groups are a collection of traces that are defined by a filter expression\. You can use groups to generate additional service graphs and supply Amazon CloudWatch metrics\. You can use the AWS X\-Ray console or X\-Ray API to create and manage groups for your services\. This topic describes how to create and manage groups by using the X\-Ray console\. For information about how to manage groups by using the X\-Ray API, see [Groups](xray-api-configuration.md#xray-api-configuration-groups)\.

You can create groups of traces for service maps, traces, or analytics\. When you create a group, the group becomes available as a filter on the group dropdown menu on all three pages: **Service map**, **Traces**, and **Analytics**\.

![\[Group menu\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/images/group-menu.png)

Groups are identified by their name or an Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\), and contain a filter expression\. The service compares incoming traces to the expression and stores them accordingly\. For more information about how to build a filter expression, see [Using filter expressions to search for traces in the console](xray-console-filters.md)\.

Updating a group's filter expression doesn't change data that's already recorded\. The update applies only to subsequent traces\. This can result in a merged graph of the new and old expressions\. To avoid this, delete a current group and create a new one\.

**Note**  
Groups are billed by the number of retrieved traces that match the filter expression\. For more information, see [AWS X\-Ray pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/pricing/)\.

## Create a group in the X\-Ray console<a name="xray-console-group-create-console"></a>

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the X\-Ray console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/xray/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home)\.

1. Open the **Create group** page from the **Groups** page in the left navigation pane, or from the group menu on one of the following pages\.
   + **Service map**
   + **Traces**
   + **Analytics**

1. Choose **Create group** on the group menu, or on the **Groups** page\.

1. On the **Create group** page, enter a name for the group\. A group name can have a maximum of 32 characters, and contain alphanumeric characters and dashes\. Group names are case sensitive\.  
![\[Create group page\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/images/group-create.png)

1. Enter a filter expression\. For more information about how to build a filter expression, see [Using filter expressions to search for traces in the console](xray-console-filters.md)\. In the following example, the group filters for fault traces from the service `api.example.com`\. and requests to the service where the response time was greater than or equal to five seconds\.

   ```
   fault = true AND http.url CONTAINS "example/game" AND responsetime >= 5
   ```

1. In **Insights**, enable or disable insights access for the group\. For more information about insights, see [Using insights in the AWS X\-Ray console](xray-console-insights.md)\.

1. In **Tags**, enter a tag key, and optionally, a tag value\. As you add a tag, a new line appears for you to enter another tag\. Tag keys must be unique\. To delete a tag, choose **X** at the end of the tag's row\. For more information about tags, see [Tagging X\-Ray sampling rules and groups](xray-tagging.md)\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

## Apply a group<a name="xray-console-group-apply"></a>

   1. Optionally, choose the time period for which you want to view data\. The default is **Last 5 minutes** on the **Relative** tab\.  
![\[Relative time span control\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/images/time-period.png)

      To set a specific date and time range, choose **Custom \(UTC\)**\. Times specified on this tab are in 24\-hour format\. For example, 6:00 PM is `18:00`\. Your custom time range can be a maximum of six hours\.

1. Although you can't rename a group, you can update the filter expression\. For more information about how to build a filter expression, see [Using filter expressions to search for traces in the console](xray-console-filters.md)\. In the following example, the group filters for fault traces from the service `api.example.com`, where the request URL address contains `example/game`, and response time for requests was greater than or equal to five seconds\.

   ```
   fault = true AND http.url CONTAINS "example/game" AND responsetime >= 5
   ```

1. In **Insights**, enable or disable insights access for the group\. For more information about insights, see [Using insights in the AWS X\-Ray console](xray-console-insights.md)\.

1. In **Tags**, edit tag keys and values\. Tag keys must be unique\. Tag values are optional; you can delete values if you want\. To delete a tag, choose **X** at the end of the tag's row\. For more information about tags, see [Tagging X\-Ray sampling rules and groups](xray-tagging.md)\.

1. When you're finished updating the filter expression, choose **Update group**\.

## Clone a group<a name="xray-console-group-clone"></a>

Cloning a group creates a new group that has the filter expression and tags of an existing group\. When you clone a group, the new group has the same name as the group from which it's cloned, with `-clone` appended to the name\.

1. You can keep the filter expression from the existing group, or optionally, enter a new filter expression\. For more information about how to build a filter expression, see [Using filter expressions to search for traces in the console](xray-console-filters.md)\. In the following example, the group filters for fault traces from the service `api.example.com`\. and requests to the service where the response time was greater than or equal to five seconds\.

   ```
   service("api.example.com") { fault = true OR responsetime >= 5 }
   ```

1. In **Tags**, edit tag keys and values, if needed\. Tag keys must be unique\. Tag values are optional; you can delete values if you want\.

## View group metrics in Amazon CloudWatch<a name="xray-console-group-cloudwatch"></a>

After a group is created, incoming traces are checked against the groupâ€™s filter expression as they're stored in the X\-Ray service\. Metrics for the number of traces matching each criteria are published to Amazon CloudWatch every minute\. Choosing **View metric** on the **Edit group** page opens the CloudWatch console to the **Metric** page\. For more information about how to use CloudWatch metrics, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the X\-Ray console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/xray/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home)\.

1. Do one of the following to open the **Edit group** page\.

   1. On the **Groups** page, choose a group to edit it\.

   1. On the group menu on one of the following pages, point to a group, and then choose **Edit**\.
      + **Service map**
