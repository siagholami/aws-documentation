Prerequisites
To complete this getting started tutorial, you need the following:
 The permissions required to work with Client VPN endpoints.
 A VPC with at least one subnet, an internet gateway, and a route to the internet gateway.
Step 1: Generate server and client certificates and keys
This tutorial uses mutual authentication. With mutual authentication, Client VPN uses certificates to perform authentication between the client and the server.
For detailed steps to generate the server and client certificates and keys, see Mutual authentication.
Step 2: Create a Client VPN endpoint
When you create a Client VPN endpoint, you create the VPN construct to which clients can connect in order to establish a VPN connection.
After you create the Client VPN endpoint, take note of the following:
 The initial state of the Client VPN endpoint is pending-associate. Clients can only establish a VPN connection after you associate at least one target network.
 You receive a Client VPN endpoint DNS name. This is the DNS name that clients use to establish a VPN connection.
 You can download the Client VPN endpoint configuration file. You can provide this file to your clients who want to connect to the VPN.
To create a Client VPN endpoint (console)


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Client VPN Endpoints and then choose Create Client VPN Endpoint.


(Optional) For Description, enter a brief description for the Client VPN endpoint.


For Client IPv4 CIDR, specify an IP address range, in CIDR notation, from which to assign client IP addresses.
Note
The IP address range cannot overlap with the target network or any of the routes that will be associated with the Client VPN endpoint. The client CIDR range must have a block size that is between /12 and /22 and not overlap with VPC CIDR or any other route in the route table. You cannot change the IP address range after you create the Client VPN endpoint.


For Server certificate ARN, specify the ARN for the TLS certificate to be used by the server. Clients use the server certificate to authenticate the Client VPN endpoint to which they are connecting. 
Note
The server certificate must be provisioned in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).


Specify the authentication method to be used to authenticate clients when they establish a VPN connection. To use mutual certificate authentication, select Use mutual authentication, and then for Client certificate ARN, specify the ARN of the client certificate generated in Step 1.


Specify whether to log data about client connections using Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For Do you want to log the details on client connections?, do one of the following:
    To enable client connection logging, choose Yes. For CloudWatch Logs log group name, enter the name of the log group to use, and for CloudWatch Logs log stream name, enter the name of the log stream to use.
    To disable client connection logging, choose No.


(Optional) Specify which DNS servers to use for DNS resolution. To use custom DNS servers, for DNS Server 1 IP address and DNS Server 2 IP address, specify the IP addresses of the DNS servers to use. To use a VPC DNS server, for either DNS Server 1 IP address or DNS Server 2 IP address, specify the IP addresses, and add the VPC DNS server IP address.
Note
Verify that the DNS servers can be reached by clients.


(Optional) To enable split-tunnel on a VPN endpoint, select Enable split-tunnel.


By default, split-tunnel on a VPN endpoint is disabled.


(Optional) By default, the Client VPN server uses the UDP transport protocol. To use the TCP transport protocol instead, for Transport Protocol, select TCP.
Note
UDP typically offers better performance than TCP.


(Optional) For VPC ID, choose the VPC to associate with the Client VPN endpoint. For Security Group IDs, choose one or more of the VPC's security groups to apply to the Client VPN endpoint.


(Optional) For VPN port, choose the VPN port number. The default is 443.


Choose Create Client VPN Endpoint.


Step 3: Enable VPN connectivity for clients
To enable clients to establish a VPN session, you must associate a target network with the Client VPN endpoint. A target network is a subnet in a VPC. 
When you associate the first subnet with the Client VPN endpoint, the following happens:
 The state of the Client VPN endpoint changes to available. Clients can now establish a VPN connection, but they cannot access any resources in the VPC until you add the authorization rules.
 The local route of the VPC is automatically added to the Client VPN endpoint route table. 
 The VPC's default security group is automatically applied for the subnet association. You can modify the security group after associating the subnet.
To associate a subnet with the Client VPN endpoint (console)


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Client VPN Endpoints.


Select the Client VPN endpoint with which to associate the subnet and choose Associations, Associate.


For VPC, choose the VPC in which the subnet is located. If you specified a VPC when you created the Client VPN endpoint, it must be the same VPC.


For Subnet to associate, choose the subnet to associate with the Client VPN endpoint.


Choose Associate.
Note
If authorization rules allow it, one subnet association is enough for clients to access a VPC's entire network. You can associate additional subnets to provide high availability in case one of the Availability Zones goes down.


Step 4: Authorize clients to access a network
To authorize clients to access the VPC in which the associated subnet is located, you must create an authorization rule. The authorization rule specifies which clients have access to the VPC. In this tutorial, we grant access to all users.
To add an authorization rule to the target network


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Client VPN Endpoints.


Select the Client VPN endpoint to which to add the authorization rule, choose Authorization, and then choose Authorize Ingress.


For Destination network to enable, enter the IP address, in CIDR notation, of the network for which you want to allow access.


Specify which clients are allowed to access the specified network. To grant access to all users, for Grant access to, choose Allow access to all users.


For Description, enter a brief description of the authorization rule.


Choose Add authorization rule.


Step 5: (Optional) Enable access to additional networks
You can enable access to additional networks connected to the VPC, such as AWS services, peered VPCs, and on-premises networks. For each additional network, you must add a route to the network and configure an authorization rule to give clients access.
In this tutorial, we add a route to the internet (0.0.0.0/0) and add an authorization rule that grants access to all users.
To enable access to additional networks (console)


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Client VPN Endpoints.


Select the Client VPN endpoint to which to add the route, choose Route Table, and then choose Create Route.


For Route destination, enter 0.0.0.0/0.


For Target VPC Subnet ID, specify the ID of the subnet through which to route traffic.


For Description, enter a brief description for the route.


Choose Create Route.


Add an authorization rule for the network to specify which clients have access. Perform the steps at Step 4: Authorize clients to access a network, for Step 4 enter 0.0.0.0/0, and for Step 5 choose Allow access to all users.


Ensure that the security group that's associated with subnet you are routing traffic through allows inbound and outbound traffic to and from the internet. To do this, add inbound and outbound rules that allow internet traffic to and from 0.0.0.0/0.


Step 6: Download the Client VPN endpoint configuration file
The final step is to download and prepare the Client VPN endpoint configuration file. The configuration file includes the Client VPN endpoint and certificate information required to establish a VPN connection. You must provide this file to the clients who need to connect to the Client VPN endpoint to establish a VPN connection. The client uploads this file into their VPN client application. For more information about using a client application to connect to the Client VPN endpoint, see the AWS Client VPN User Guide.
After you create the Client VPN endpoint in Step 2, the console displays the DNS name, for example, cvpn-endpoint-0102bc4c2eEXAMPLE.prod.clientvpn.us-west-2.amazonaws.com. To specify the DNS name, you must specify a random string in front of the displayed name so that the format is random_string.displayed_DNS_name, for example, asdfa.cvpn-endpoint-0102bc4c2eEXAMPLE.prod.clientvpn.us-west-2.amazonaws.com.
To download and prepare the Client VPN endpoint configuration file (console)


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Client VPN Endpoints.


Select the Client VPN endpoint for which to download the Client VPN configuration file and choose Download Client Configuration.


Copy the client certificate and key, which were generated in Step 1, to the same folder as the downloaded Client VPN endpoint configuration file. The client certificate and key can be found in the following locations in the cloned OpenVPN easy-rsa repo: 
    Client certificate — easy-rsa/easyrsa3/pki/issued/client1.domain.tld.crt
    Client key — easy-rsa/easyrsa3/pki/private/client1.domain.tld.key


Open the Client VPN endpoint configuration file using your preferred text editor and add the following to the end of the file. Replace /path/ with the location of the client certificate and key (the location is relative to the client that's connecting to the endpoint).


cert /path/client1.domain.tld.crt
   key /path/client1.domain.tld.key


Prepend a random string to the Client VPN endpoint DNS name. Locate the line that specifies the Client VPN endpoint DNS name, and prepend a random string to it so that the format is random_string.displayed_DNS_name. For example:
    Original DNS name: cvpn-endpoint-0102bc4c2eEXAMPLE.prod.clientvpn.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
    Modified DNS name: asdfa.cvpn-endpoint-0102bc4c2eEXAMPLE.prod.clientvpn.us-west-2.amazonaws.com


Save and close the Client VPN endpoint configuration file.


Distribute the Client VPN endpoint configuration file and the client certificate and key to your clients.


To download and prepare the Client VPN endpoint configuration file (AWS CLI)

Download the Client VPN endpoint configuration file.

$ aws ec2 export-client-vpn-client-configuration --client-vpn-endpoint-id endpoint_id --output text>client-config.ovpn


Copy the client certificate and key, which were generated in Step 1, to the same folder as the downloaded Client VPN endpoint configuration file. The client certificate and key can be found in the following locations in the cloned OpenVPN easy-rsa repo:
    Client certificate — easy-rsa/easyrsa3/pki/issued/client1.domain.tld.crt
    Client key — easy-rsa/easyrsa3/pki/private/client1.domain.tld.key


Open the Client VPN endpoint configuration file using your preferred text editor (such as vim or nano) or use the cat >> client-config.ovpn command and add the following to the end of the file. Replace /path/ with the location of the client certificate and key (the location is relative to the client that's connecting to the endpoint).


cert /path/client1.domain.tld.crt
   key /path/client1.domain.tld.key


Prepend a random string to the Client VPN endpoint DNS name. Locate the line that specifies the Client VPN endpoint DNS name, and prepend a random string to it so that the format is random_string.displayed_DNS_name. For example:
    Original DNS name: cvpn-endpoint-0102bc4c2eEXAMPLE.prod.clientvpn.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
    Modified DNS name: asdfa.cvpn-endpoint-0102bc4c2eEXAMPLE.prod.clientvpn.us-west-2.amazonaws.com


Distribute the Client VPN endpoint configuration file and the client certificate and key to your clients. 


Step 7: Connect to the Client VPN endpoint
You can connect to the Client VPN endpoint using the AWS-provided client or another OpenVPN-based client application. For more information, see the AWS Client VPN User Guide.
