Creating a hosted virtual interface
You can create a public, transit or private hosted virtual interface. Before you begin, ensure that you have read the information in Prerequisites for virtual interfaces.
Creating a hosted private virtual interface
To create a hosted private virtual interface


Open the AWS Direct Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/v2/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Virtual Interfaces.


Choose Create virtual interface.


Under Virtual interface type, for Type, choose Private.


Under Private virtual interface settings, do the following:


For Virtual interface name, enter a name for the virtual interface.


For Connection, choose the Direct Connect connection that you want to use for this interface.


For Virtual interface owner, choose Another AWS account, and then for Virtual interface owner, enter the ID of the AWS account to own this virtual interface.


For VLAN, enter the ID number for your virtual local area network (VLAN). 


For BGP ASN, enter the The Border Gateway Protocol Autonomous System Number of your on-premises peer router for the new virtual interface.
The valid values are 1-2147483647.


Under Additional Settings, do the following:


To configure an IPv4 BGP or an IPv6 peer, do the following:
[IPv4] To configure an IPv4 BGP peer, choose IPv4 and do one of the following:
   To specify these IP addresses yourself, for Your router peer ip, enter the destination IPv4 CIDR address to which Amazon should send traffic. 
   For Amazon router peer ip, enter the IPv4 CIDR address to use to send traffic to AWS.
[IPv6] To configure an IPv6 BGP peer, choose IPv6. The peer IPv6 addresses are automatically assigned from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses. You cannot specify custom IPv6 addresses.


To change the maximum transmission unit (MTU) from 1500 (default) to 9001 (jumbo frames), select Jumbo MTU (MTU size 9001).


(Optional) Add or remove a tag.
[Add a tag] Choose Add tag and do the following:
   For Key, enter the key name.
   For Value, enter the key value.
[Remove a tag] Next to the tag, choose Remove tag.


After the hosted virtual interface is accepted by the owner of the other AWS account, you can download the router configuration file.

Creating a hosted public virtual interface
To create a hosted public virtual interface


Open the AWS Direct Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/v2/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Virtual Interfaces.


Choose Create virtual interface.


Under Virtual interface type, for Type, choose Public.


Under Public Virtual Interface Settings, do the following:


For Virtual interface name, enter a name for the virtual interface.


For Connection, choose the Direct Connect connection that you want to use for this interface.


For Virtual interface owner, choose Another AWS account, and then for Virtual interface owner, enter the ID of the AWS account to own this virtual interface.


For VLAN, enter the ID number for your virtual local area network (VLAN). 


For BGP ASN, enter the The Border Gateway Protocol Autonomous System Number of your on-premises peer router for the new virtual interface.
The valid values are 1-2147483647.


To configure an IPv4 BGP or an IPv6 peer, do the following:


[IPv4] To configure an IPv4 BGP peer, choose IPv4 and do one of the following:
    To specify these IP addresses yourself, for Your router peer ip, enter the destination IPv4 CIDR address to which Amazon should send traffic. 
    For Amazon router peer ip, enter the IPv4 CIDR address to use to send traffic to AWS.
[IPv6] To configure an IPv6 BGP peer, choose IPv6. The peer IPv6 addresses are automatically assigned from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses. You cannot specify custom IPv6 addresses.


To advertise prefixes to Amazon, for Prefixes you want to advertise, enter the IPv4 CIDR destination addresses (separated by commas) to which traffic should be routed over the virtual interface. 


To provide your own key to authenticate the BGP session, under Additional Settings, for BGP authentication key, enter the key.


If you do not enter a value, then AWS generates a BGP key.

(Optional) Add or remove a tag.

[Add a tag] Choose Add tag and do the following:
    For Key, enter the key name.
    For Value, enter the key value.
[Remove a tag] Next to the tag, choose Remove tag.


Choose Create virtual interface.


After the hosted virtual interface is accepted by the owner of the other AWS account, you can download the router configuration file.


To create a hosted public virtual interface using the command line or API
 allocate-public-virtual-interface (AWS CLI)
 AllocatePublicVirtualInterface (AWS Direct Connect API)
Creating a hosted transit virtual interface
To create a hosted transit virtual interface
Important
If you associate your transit gateway with one or more Direct Connect gateways, the Autonomous System Number (ASN) used by the transit gateway and the Direct Connect gateway must be different. For example, if you use the default ASN 64512 for both the transit gateway and the Direct Connect gateway, the association request fails.


Open the AWS Direct Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/v2/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Virtual Interfaces.


Choose Create virtual interface.


Under Virtual interface type, for Type, choose Transit.


Under Transit virtual interface settings, do the following:


For Virtual interface name, enter a name for the virtual interface.


For Connection, choose the Direct Connect connection that you want to use for this interface.


For Virtual interface owner, choose Another AWS account, and then for Virtual interface owner, enter the ID of the AWS account to own this virtual interface.


For VLAN, enter the ID number for your virtual local area network (VLAN). 


For BGP ASN, enter the The Border Gateway Protocol Autonomous System Number of your on-premises peer router for the new virtual interface.
The valid values are 1-2147483647.

To change the maximum transmission unit (MTU) from 1500 (default) to 8500 (jumbo frames), select Jumbo MTU (MTU size 8500).


[Optional] Add a tag. Do the following:
[Add a tag] Choose Add tag and do the following:
   For Key, enter the key name.
   For Value, enter the key value.
[Remove a tag] Next to the tag, choose Remove tag.


Choose Create virtual interface.
