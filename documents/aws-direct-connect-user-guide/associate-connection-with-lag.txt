Associating a connection with a LAG
You can associate an existing connection with a LAG. The connection can be standalone, or it can be part of another LAG. The connection must be on the same AWS device and must use the same bandwidth as the LAG. If the connection is already associated with another LAG, you cannot re-associate it if removing the connection causes the original LAG to fall below its threshold for the minimum number of operational connections.
Associating a connection to a LAG automatically re-associates its virtual interfaces to the LAG.
Important
Connectivity to AWS over the connection is interrupted during association.
