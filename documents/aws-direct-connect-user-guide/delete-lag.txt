Deleting LAGs
If you no longer need LAGs, you can delete them. You cannot delete a LAG if it has virtual interfaces associated with it. You must first delete the virtual interfaces, or associate them with a different LAG or connection. Deleting a LAG does not delete the connections in the LAG; you must delete the connections yourself. For more information, see Deleting connections.
