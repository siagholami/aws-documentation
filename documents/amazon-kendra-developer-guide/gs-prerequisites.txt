Prerequisites
The following steps are prerequisites for the getting started exercises. The steps show you how to set up your account, create an IAM role that gives Amazon Kendra permission to make calls on your behalf, and upload documents for indexing into an Amazon S3 bucket.


Create an AWS account and an AWS Identity and Access Management user, as specified in Sign up for AWS.


If you are using an S3 bucket containing documents to test Amazon Kendra, create an S3 bucket in the same region that you are using Amazon Kendra. For instructions, see Creating and Configuring an S3 Bucket in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide.


Upload your documents to your S3 bucket. For instructions, see Uploading, Downloading, and Managing Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide.
If you are using another data source, you must have an active site and credentials to connect to the data source.
If you are using the console to get started, do Getting started with an S3 bucket (Console). 
Prerequisites for the AWS CLI and SDK
If you are using the AWS CLI or the SDK, you need to create IAM roles and polices for Kendra to use to access resources. If you are using the console, you don't need to create IAM roles and polices. They are created as part of the console procedure.
To create an IAM policy and role for the AWS CLI and SDK that enables Kendra to access your Amazon CloudWatch Logs.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


From the left menu, choose Policies and then choose Create policy.


Choose JSON and then replace the default policy with the following:

               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
               ],
               "Resource": "*",
