AttributeFilter
Provides filtering the query results based on document attributes.
When you use the AndAllFilters or OrAllFilters, filters you can use 2 layers under the first attribute filter. For example, you can use:
<AndAllFilters> 


<OrAllFilters> 


<EqualTo> 


If you use more than 2 layers, you receive a ValidationException exception with the message "AttributeFilter cannot have a depth of more than 2."
