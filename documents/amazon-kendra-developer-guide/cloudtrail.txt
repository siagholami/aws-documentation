Logging Amazon Kendra API calls with AWS CloudTrail logs
Amazon Kendra is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon Kendra. CloudTrail captures all API calls from Amazon Kendra as events, including calls from the Amazon Kendra console and from code calls to the Amazon Kendra APIs. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous deliver of CloudTrail events to and Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Amazon Kendra. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Amazon Kendra, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.
To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to configure and enable it, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
Amazon Kendra Information in CloudTrail
CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When activity occurs in Amazon Kendra, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in the CloudTrail Event history. You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account. For more information, see Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History. 
For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for Amazon Kendra, create a trail. A trail is a configuration that enables CloudTrail to deliver events as log files to a specified S3 bucket. By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all AWS Regions. The trail logs events from all Regions in the AWS partition and delivers the log files to the S3 bucket that you specify. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see:

 Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Regions and Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Accounts
CloudTrail logs all Amazon Kendra actions, which are documented in the API Reference. For example, calls to the CreateIndex, CreateDataSource, and Query operations generate entries in the CloudTrail log files. 
Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request. For more information, see the CloudTrail userIdentity Element.
Example: Amazon Kendra log file Entries
A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to a specified S3 bucket. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time of the action, request parameters, and so on. CloudTrail log files aren't an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they don't appear in any specific order. 
Calls to the Query operation creates the following entry.
