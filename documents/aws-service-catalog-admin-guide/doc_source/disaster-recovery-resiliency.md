# Resilience in AWS Service Catalog<a name="disaster-recovery-resiliency"></a>

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones\. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low\-latency, high\-throughput, and highly redundant networking\. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption\. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures\. 

For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see [AWS Global Infrastructure](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)\.

 In addition to the AWS global infrastructure, AWS Service Catalog offers AWS Service Catalog self\-service actions\. With self\-service actions, customers can reduce administrative maintenance and end\-user training while adhering to compliance and security measures\. With self\-service actions, as the administrator, you can enable end users to perform operational tasks such as backup and restore, troubleshoot issues, run approved commands, and request permissions in AWS Service Catalog\.
