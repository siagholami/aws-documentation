# Using AWS Service Catalog Constraints<a name="constraints"></a>

You apply constraints to control the rules that are applied to a product in a specific portfolio when the end users launches it\. When the end users launches the product, they will see the rules you have applied using constraints\. You can apply constraints to a product once it is put into a portfolio\. Constraints are active as soon as you create them, and they're applied to all current versions of a product that have not been launched\.
