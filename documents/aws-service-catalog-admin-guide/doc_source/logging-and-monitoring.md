# Logging and Monitoring in AWS Service Catalog<a name="logging-and-monitoring"></a>

 AWS Service Catalog is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that captures all of the AWS Service Catalog API calls and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. For more information, see [Logging AWS Service Catalog API Calls with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/dg//logging-using-cloudtrail)\.

 You can also use notification constraints to set up Amazon SNS notifications about stack events\. For more information, see [AWS Service Catalog Notification Constraints](constraints-notification.md)\.
