# Managing Products<a name="catalogs_products"></a>

You create products by packaging an AWS CloudFormation template with metadata, update products by creating a new version based on an updated template, and group products together into portfolios to distribute them to users\.

New versions of products are propagated to all users who have access to the product through a portfolio\. When you distribute an update, end users can update existing provisioned products with just a few clicks\.
