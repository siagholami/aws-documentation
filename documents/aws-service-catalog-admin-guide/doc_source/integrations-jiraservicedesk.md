# AWS Service Management Connector for Jira Service Desk<a name="integrations-jiraservicedesk"></a>

 To help customers integrate provisioning secure, compliant, and pre\-approved AWS products into their Jira Service Desk portal, AWS created the AWS Service Management Connector for Jira Service Desk \(formerly the AWS Service Management Connector\)\. 

 The AWS Service Management Connector for Jira Service Desk allows Jira Service Desk end users to provision, manage, and operate AWS resources natively via Atlassianâ€™s Jira Service Desk\. Jira Service Desk administrators can provide pre\-approved, secured, and governed AWS resources to end users via AWS Service Catalog, execute automation playbooks via AWS Systems Manager, and track resources in a configuration item view powered by AWS Config seamlessly on the Jira Service Desk with the AWS Service Management Connector\. 

 Jira Service Desk end users can browse, request, and provision pre\-secured AWS solutions, view configuration item details on provisioned products, and execute workflows within Jira Service Desk on AWS resources\. This simplifies AWS product request actions for Jira Service Desk users and provides Jira Service Desk governance and oversight over AWS products\. 

 The AWS\-supplied connector is available at no charge in the Atlassian Marketplace\. This new feature is generally available in all AWS Regions where AWS Service Catalog, AWS Config, and AWS Systems Manager services are available\.
