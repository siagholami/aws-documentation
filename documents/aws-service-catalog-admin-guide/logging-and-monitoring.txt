Logging and Monitoring in AWS Service Catalog
AWS Service Catalog is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that captures all of the AWS Service Catalog API calls and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. For more information, see Logging AWS Service Catalog API Calls with CloudTrail.
You can also use notification constraints to set up Amazon SNS notifications about stack events. For more information, see AWS Service Catalog Notification Constraints.
