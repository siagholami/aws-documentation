AWS Service Catalog TagOption Library
To allow administrators to easily manage tags on provisioned products, AWS Service Catalog provides a TagOption library. A TagOption is a key-value pair managed in AWS Service Catalog. It is not an AWS tag, but serves as a template for creating an AWS tag based on the TagOption.
The TagOption library makes it easier to enforce the following:
 A consistent taxonomy
 Proper tagging of AWS Service Catalog resources
 Defined, user-selectable options for allowed tags
Administrators can associate TagOptions with portfolios and products. During a product launch (provisioning), AWS Service Catalog aggregates the associated portfolio and product TagOptions, and applies them to the provisioned product, as shown in the following diagram.

With the TagOption library, you can deactivate TagOptions and retain their associations to portfolios or products, and reactivate them when you need them. This approach not only helps maintain library integrity, it also allows you to manage TagOptions that might be used intermittently, or only under special circumstances.
You manage TagOptions with the AWS Service Catalog console or the TagOption library API. For more information, see AWS Service Catalog API Reference.
