Updating Products
When you need to update a product's AWS CloudFormation template, you create a new version of your product. A new product version is automatically available to all users who have access to a portfolio that contains the product. 
Users who are currently running a provisioned product of the previous version of the product can update their provisioned product using the end user console view. When a new version of a product is available, users can use the Update provisioned product command on either the Provisioned product list or Provisioned product details pages. 
Note
Before you create a new version of a product, test your product updates in AWS CloudFormation to ensure that they work.
To create a new product version


Navigate to the Products page. 


Choose the product name.


On the product details page, expand the Versions section, and then choose Create new version. 


For Version details, enter the following:
    Select template – An AWS CloudFormation template from a local drive or a URL that points to a template stored in Amazon S3. If you specify an Amazon S3 URL, it must begin with https://. The extension for the template file must be .template and can be either JSON– or YAML-formatted text files. For more information, see Template Formats in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
    Version title – the name of the product version (e.g., "v1", "v2beta"). No spaces are allowed. 
    Description (optional) – A description of the product version including how this version differs from the previous version.
    Guidance – By default, product versions don't have any guidance, so end users can use that version to update and launch provisioned products. If you set the guidance to deprecated, users can make updates to a provisioned product but can't launch new provisioned products of that version.


Choose Save.
You can also use CodePipeline to create and configure a pipeline to deploy your product template to AWS Service Catalog and deliver changes you have made in your source repository. For more information, see Tutorial: Create a Pipeline That Deploys to AWS Service Catalog.
