Managing Budgets
You can use AWS Budgets to track your service costs and usage within AWS Service Catalog. You can associate budgets with AWS Service Catalog products and portfolios.
AWS Budgets gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. Information about AWS Budgets is available at https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets.

Prerequisites
Before using AWS Budgets, you need to activate cost allocation tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. For more information, see Activating User-Defined Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide. 
Note
Tags take up to 24 hours to activate.
You also need to enable user access to the AWS Billing and Cost Management console for any users or groups who will be using the Budgets feature. You can do this by creating a new policy for your users.
To allow IAM users to create budgets, you must also allow users to view billing information. If you want to use Amazon SNS notifications, you can give users the ability to create Amazon SNS notifications, as shown in the policy example below.
To create the budgets policy


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Policies. 


In the content pane, choose Create policy. 


Choose the JSON tab and copy the text from the following JSON policy document. Paste this text into the JSON text box. 


{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "Stmt1435216493000",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "aws-portal:ViewBilling",
                   "aws-portal:ModifyBilling",
                   "budgets:ViewBudget",
                   "budgets:ModifyBudget"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "*"
               ]
           },
           {
               "Sid": "Stmt1435216552000",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "sns:*"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }


When you are finished, choose Review policy. The Policy Validator reports any syntax errors.


On the Review page, give your policy a name. Review the policy Summary to see the permissions granted by your policy, and then choose Create policy to save your work. 


The new policy appears in the list of managed policies and is ready to attach to your users and groups. For more information, see Create and Attach Customer Managed Policy in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
Creating a Budget
In the AWS Service Catalog administrator console, the Products and Portfolios pages list information about existing products and portfolios and allow you to take actions on them. To create a budget, first decide which product or portfolio you want to associate the budget to.
To create a budget


Open the AWS Service Catalog console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/.


Choose either Products or Portfolios.


Select the product or portfolio you want to add a budget to.


Open the Actions menu, then choose Create budget.


On the Budget creation page, associate one tag type to your budget.


There are two types of tags: AutoTags and TagOptions. AutoTags are tags that identify the portfolio, product, and user that launched a product, and are automatically applied by AWS Service Catalog to provisioned resources. A TagOption is an administrator-defined key-value pair managed in AWS Service Catalog.
In order for spending that occurs on a portfolio or product to reflect on the associated budget, they must have the same tag. Note that a tag key being used for the first time can take 24 hours to activate. For more information, see Prerequisites.


Choose Continue.


You will be taken to the Set up your budget page. Continue your budget setup by following the steps on Creating a Budget.


After you create a budget, you need to associate it to the product or portfolio.
Associating a Budget
Each portfolio or product can have one budget associated to it, but each budget can be associated to multiple products and portfolios.
When you associate a budget to a product or portfolio, you will be able to view information about the budget from that product or portfolio's detail page. In order for spending that occurs on the product or portfolio to be reflected on the budget, you must associate the same tags on both the budget and the product or portfolio.
Note
If you delete a budget from within AWS Budgets, existing associations with AWS Service Catalog products and portfolios will still exist but AWS Service Catalog will be unable to display any information about the deleted budget.
To associate a budget


Open the AWS Service Catalog console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/.


Choose either Products or Portfolios.


Select the product or portfolio you want to associate a budget to.


Open the Actions menu, then choose Associate budget.


On the Budget association page, select an existing budget. Then choose Continue.


The Portfolios or Products table will now include data for the budget you just added.


Viewing a Budget
If a budget is associated to a product, you can view information about the budget on the Products and Product details page. If a budget is associated to a portfolio, you can view information about the budget on the Portfolios and Portfolio details page.
Both the Portfolios and Products pages display budget information for existing resources. You can see columns displaying Current vs. budget and Forecast vs. budget.
When you click on a product or portfolio, you are taken to a detail page. These Portfolio detail and Product detail pages have a section with detailed information about the associated budget. You can see the budgeted amount, current spend, and forecasted spend. You also have the option to view budget details and edit the budget.
Disassociating a Budget
You can disassociate a budget from a portfolio or product.
Note
If you delete a budget from within AWS Budgets, existing associations with AWS Service Catalog products and portfolios will still exist but AWS Service Catalog will be unable to display any information about the deleted budget.
To disassociate a budget


Open the AWS Service Catalog console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/.


Choose Products or Portfolios.


Select the product or portfolio you want to disassociate a budget from.


Open the Actions menu, then choose Disassociate budget.


An alert will appear asking you to confirm that you want to disassociate the budget. Choose Confirm.
