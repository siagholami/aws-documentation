Getting Started
This tutorial introduces you to the key tasks that you do as a catalog administrator. You create a product that is based on an AWS CloudFormation template, which defines the AWS resources used by the product. The product, Linux Desktop, is a cloud development environment that runs on Amazon Linux. You add the product to a portfolio and distribute it to the end user. Finally, you log in as the end user to test the product.
