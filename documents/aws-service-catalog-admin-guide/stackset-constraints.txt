Creating StackSet Constraints
To apply a stack set constraint to an AWS Service Catalog product


Go to AWS Service Catalog as a catalog admin


Choose the portfolio that contains the product.


Expand Constraints and choose Add constraints.


Choose the product from Product and set Constraint type to Stack Set. Choose Continue.


On the Stack Set constraint page, enter a description.


Choose the account(s) in which you want to create products.


Choose the region(s) in which you want to deploy products. Products are deployed in these regions in the order that you specify.


Choose the AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole role that will be used to manage your target accounts.


Choose the AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role that the Administrator Role will assume.


Choose Submit.


Note that the Connector for ServiceNow v2.3.4 - AWS Commercial Regions and Connector for ServiceNow v2.3.4 - AWS GovCloud West Region templates create the permissions as well as outputs needed for stack set constraints. Example stack set outputs: 
SCStackSetAdministratorRoleARN 
            arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole SCIAMStackSetExecutionRoleName 
            AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole  
            SCIAMAdminRoleARN 
            arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole
Note
Replace the 123456789123 with your account information.
