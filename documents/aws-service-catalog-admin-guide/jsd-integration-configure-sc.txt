Configuring AWS Service Catalog
Now that you have created two IAM users with baseline permissions in each account, the next step is to configure AWS Service Catalog. This section describes how to configure AWS Service Catalog to have a portfolio that includes an Amazon S3 bucket product. Use the Amazon S3 template located at Creating an Amazon S3 Bucket for Website Hosting for your preliminary product. Copy and save the Amazon S3 template to your device. 
To configure AWS Service Catalog


Create a portfolio by following the steps at Step 3: Create an AWS Service Catalog Portfolio.


To add the Amazon S3 bucket product to the portfolio you just created, in the AWS Service Catalog console, on the Upload new product page, enter product details. 


For Select template, choose the Amazon S3 bucket AWS CloudFormation template you saved to your device. 


Set Constraint type to Launch for the product that you just created with the SCConnectLaunch role in the baseline permissions. For additional launch constraint instructions, see AWS Service Catalog Launch Constraints. 


Note
The AWS configuration design requires each AWS Service Catalog product to have either a launch or StackSet constraint. Failure to follow this step may result in an Unable to Retrieve Parameter message within Jira Service Desk Service Catalog.
Creating Stack Set Constraint
AWS CloudFormation StackSets enable users to create products that are deployed across multiple accounts and regions. In AWS Service Catalog, a stack set constraint allows you to configure product deployment options. 
To apply a stack set constraint to an AWS Service Catalog product


Go to AWS Service Catalog as a catalog administrator. 


Choose the portfolio that contains the product you want to apply a constraint to. 


Expand Constraints and choose Add constraints. 


Choose the product from Product and set Constraint type to Stack Set. Choose Continue. 


On the Stack set constraint page, enter a description. 


Choose the accounts in which you want to create products. 


Choose the regions in which you want to deploy products. Products are deployed in these regions in the order that you specify. 


Choose the AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministratorRole role that will be used to manage your target accounts. 


Choose the AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role that the administrator role will assume. 


Choose Submit. 
Note that the Connector for Jira Service Desk v1.5.0 - AWS Commercial Regions and Connector for Jira Service Desk v1.5.0 - AWS GovCloud West Region templates create the permissions as well as the outputs needed for stack set constraints. Example stack set outputs: 


SCStackSetAdministratorRoleARN 
                       arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole SCIAMStackSetExecutionRoleName 
                       AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole  
                       SCIAMAdminRoleARN 
                       arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole
Note that AWS Service Catalog products can have either a stack set or a launch constraint, but not both\.
