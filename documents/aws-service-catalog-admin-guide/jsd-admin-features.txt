Jira Additional Administrator Features
The following sections describe approvals and access controls that are available in Jira.
Approvals
The approval agent has access to a screen with the options to approve or reject the product request. For a rejection, the agent can add a comment explaining why they are rejecting the request. The requester is able to see the status of the request, such as Waiting for Approval, Scheduled, Launching, or Available. 
Changes to approver group members do not impact approvers identified for pre-existing issues but do affect whether the approval is permitted. Approver users are assigned to the issue at the time the issue is created, and only these users are given the option to approve the request. The approver user must still be a member of the group when the approval is made, otherwise the approval is rejected. 
As with AWS Service Catalog, all post-provision actions, including termination, are pre-approved for the user or group who is approved to provision it. 
Access Controls
Access controls can be set on portfolios, as described earlier in this guide. Those access controls are in addition to the per-project enablement: users must have access to an AWS Connector-enabled project and belong to the groups enabled for a portfolio in order to provision products in that portfolio.
