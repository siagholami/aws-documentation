Adding Constraints
To control how users are able to use products, add constraints. For more information about the types of constraints that AWS Service Catalog supports, see Using AWS Service Catalog Constraints. 
You add constraints to products after they have been placed in a portfolio.
To add a constraint to a product


Open the AWS Service Catalog console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/.


Choose Portfolios and select a portfolio. 


In the portfolio details page, expand the Constraints section and choose Add constraints. 


For Product, select the product to which to apply the constraint.


For Constraint type, choose one of the following options:
    Launch – The IAM role that AWS Service Catalog uses to launch and manage the product. For more information, see AWS Service Catalog Launch Constraints.
    Notification – The Amazon SNS topic specified to receive notifications. For more information, see AWS Service Catalog Notification Constraints.
    Template – A JSON–formatted text file that contains one or more rules. Rules are added to the AWS CloudFormation template used by the product. For more information, see Template Constraint Rules.
    Stack Set – Uses AWS CloudFormation StackSets to specify multiple accounts and regions for the AWS Service Catalog product launch. For more information, see AWS Service Catalog Stack Set Constraints.
    Tag Update – Allows you to update tags after the product has been provisioned. For more information, see AWS Service Catalog Tag Update Constraints.


Choose Continue.
