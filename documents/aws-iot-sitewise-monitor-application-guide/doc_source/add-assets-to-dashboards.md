# Adding asset properties to dashboards<a name="add-assets-to-dashboards"></a>

As the project owner, you define dashboards to give your viewers a standard way to look at asset properties\. By providing a consistent view, you ensure that everyone sees the data that you want them to see, in the same manner\. You group asset properties on to dashboards in a way that makes sense for your business and viewers\.

**Note**  
Project viewers can't modify a dashboard\.

You can add asset properties to a new dashboard or an existing dashboard\.

**To add asset properties**

1. In the navigation bar, choose the **Projects** icon\.
