# Configuring trend lines<a name="configure-trend-lines"></a>

As a project owner, you can configure trend lines to display statistical analyses on your data\. When you add a trend line, you choose the type of analysis and the property to analyze\. This lets you and your team identify trends in your data to better understand your operation\.

The following visualization types support trend lines:
+ [Line](choose-visualization-types.md#line-charts)
+ [Scatter](choose-visualization-types.md#scatter-charts)
+ [Bar](choose-visualization-types.md#bar-charts)

The following is an example visualization with a linear trend line\.

**Note**  
The dashboard uses only data from the selected time range to compute trend lines\. This means that trend lines only show trends for visible data\.
