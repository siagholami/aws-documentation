Changing project details
As a portal administrator, you can change your project name or project owner. If you add a project owner, the new owner receives an email that invites them to the project. If you remove an owner, no email is sent, so you should notify them of the ownership change.
Note
You must be a portal administrator to change project details.

On the Projects page, choose the project to update.



In the Project details section of the project details page, choose Edit.
