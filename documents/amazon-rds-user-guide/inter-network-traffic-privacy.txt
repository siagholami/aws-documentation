Internetwork Traffic Privacy
Connections are protected both between Amazon RDS and on-premises applications and between Amazon RDS and other AWS resources within the same AWS Region.
Traffic Between Service and On-Premises Clients and Applications
You have two connectivity options between your private network and AWS: 
 An AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. For more information, see What is AWS Site-to-Site VPN?
 An AWS Direct Connect connection. For more information, see What is AWS Direct Connect?
You get access to Amazon RDS through the network by using AWS-published API operations. Clients must support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes. Additionally, you must sign requests using an access key identifier and a secret access key that are associated with an IAM principal. Or you can use the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests.
