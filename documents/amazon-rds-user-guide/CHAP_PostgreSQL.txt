PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS
Amazon RDS supports DB instances running several versions of PostgreSQL. You can create DB instances and DB snapshots, point-in-time restores and backups. DB instances running PostgreSQL support Multi-AZ deployments, read replicas, Provisioned IOPS, and can be created inside a VPC. You can also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to connect to a DB instance running PostgreSQL.
Before creating a DB instance, you should complete the steps in the Setting Up for Amazon RDS section of this guide. 
You can use any standard SQL client application to run commands for the instance from your client computer. Such applications include pgAdmin, a popular Open Source administration and development tool for PostgreSQL, or psql, a command line utility that is part of a PostgreSQL installation. To deliver a managed service experience, Amazon RDS doesn't provide host access to DB instances, and it restricts access to certain system procedures and tables that require advanced privileges. Amazon RDS supports access to databases on a DB instance using any standard SQL client application. Amazon RDS doesn't allow direct host access to a DB instance by using Telnet or Secure Shell (SSH). 
Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL is compliant with many industry standards. For example, you can use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL databases to build HIPAA-compliant applications and to store healthcare-related information, including protected health information (PHI) under a completed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with AWS. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL also meets Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) security requirements. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL has received a FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) at the FedRAMP HIGH Baseline within the AWS GovCloud (US-West) Region. For more information on supported compliance standards, see AWS Cloud Compliance.
To import PostgreSQL data into a DB instance, follow the information in the Importing Data into PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS section.

The following are the common management tasks you perform with an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance, with links to relevant documentation for each task. 



Task Area
Relevant Documentation




Setting up Amazon RDS for first-time use There are prerequisites you must complete before you create your DB instance. For example, DB instances are created by default with a firewall that prevents access to it. You therefore must create a security group with the correct IP addresses and network configuration to access the DB instance.
Setting Up for Amazon RDS


Understanding Amazon RDS DB instances If you are creating a DB instance for production purposes, you should understand how instance classes, storage types, and Provisioned IOPS work in Amazon RDS.
DB Instance Classes Amazon RDS Storage Types Provisioned IOPS SSD Storage


Finding supported PostgreSQL versions Amazon RDS supports several versions of PostgreSQL.
Supported PostgreSQL Database Versions


Setting up high availability and failover support A production DB instance should use Multi-AZ deployments. Multi-AZ deployments provide increased availability, data durability, and fault tolerance for DB instances.
High Availability (Multi-AZ) for Amazon RDS


Understanding the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network If your AWS account has a default VPC, then your DB instance is automatically created inside the default VPC. In some cases, your account might not have a default VPC, and you might want the DB instance in a VPC. In these cases, create the VPC and subnet groups before you create the DB instance.
Determining Whether You Are Using the EC2-VPC or EC2-Classic Platform Working with a DB Instance in a VPC


Importing data into Amazon RDS PostgreSQL You can use several different tools to import data into your PostgreSQL DB instance on Amazon RDS.
Importing Data into PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS


Setting up read-only read replicas (primary and standbys) PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS supports read replicas in both the same AWS Region and in a different AWS Region from the primary instance.
Working with Read Replicas Working with PostgreSQL Read Replicas in Amazon RDS Creating a Read Replica in a Different AWS Region


Understanding security groups By default, DB instances are created with a firewall that prevents access to them. You therefore must create a security group with the correct IP addresses and network configuration to access the DB instance.  In general, if your DB instance is on the EC2-Classic platform, you need to create a DB security group. If your DB instance is on the EC2-VPC platform, you need to create a VPC security group.
Determining Whether You Are Using the EC2-VPC or EC2-Classic Platform Controlling Access with Security Groups


Setting up parameter groups and features If your DB instance is going to require specific database parameters, you should create a parameter group before you create the DB instance.
Working with DB Parameter Groups


Performing common DBA tasks for PostgreSQL Some of the more common tasks for PostgreSQL DBAs include:  [See the AWS documentation website for more details]
Common DBA Tasks for PostgreSQL


Connecting to your PostgreSQL DB instance After creating a security group and associating it to a DB instance, you can connect to the DB instance using any standard SQL client application such as pgadmin III.

Best Practices for Working with PostgreSQL



Working with the Database Preview Environment
When you create a DB instance in Amazon RDS, you know that the PostgreSQL version it's based on has been tested and is fully supported by Amazon. The PostgreSQL community releases new versions and new extensions continuously. You can try out new PostgreSQL versions and extensions before they are fully supported. To do that, you can create a new DB instance in the Database Preview Environment. 
DB instances in the Database Preview Environment are similar to DB instances in a production environment. However, keep in mind several important factors:
 All DB instances are deleted 60 days after you create them, along with any backups and snapshots.
 You can only create a DB instance in a virtual private cloud (VPC) based on the Amazon VPC service.
 You can only create M5, T3, and R5 instance types. For more information about RDS instance classes, see DB Instance Classes. 
 You can only use General Purpose SSD and Provisioned IOPS SSD storage. 
 You can't get help from AWS Support with DB instances. You can post your questions in the RDS Database Preview Environment Forum.
 You can't copy a snapshot of a DB instance to a production environment.
 You can use both single-AZ and multi-AZ deployments.
 You can use standard PostgreSQL dump and load functions to export databases from or import databases to the Database Preview Environment.

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Versions and Extensions
Amazon RDS supports DB instances running several editions of PostgreSQL. Use this section to see how to work with PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS. You should also be aware of the limits for PostgreSQL DB instances.
You can specify any currently supported PostgreSQL version when creating a new DB instance. You can specify the major version (such as PostgreSQL 10), and any supported minor version for the specified major version. If no version is specified, Amazon RDS defaults to a supported version, typically the most recent version. If a major version is specified but a minor version is not, Amazon RDS defaults to a recent release of the major version you have specified. To see a list of supported versions, as well as defaults for newly created DB instances, use the  describe-db-engine-versions AWS CLI command.

PostgreSQL Version 11.1 on Amazon RDS
PostgreSQL version 11.1 contains several improvements that were announced in PostgreSQL 11.1 Released! This version includes SQL stored procedures that enable embedded transactions within a procedure. This version also includes major improvements to partitioning and parallelism and many useful performance improvements. For example, by using a non-null constant for a column default, you can now use an ALTER TABLE command to add a column without causing a table rewrite.
PostgreSQL version 11.1 contains several bug fixes for issues in release 11. For complete details, see the PostgreSQL Release 11.1 documentation. Some changes in this version include the following:
 Partitioning – Partitioning improvements include support for hash partitioning, enabling creation of a default partition, and dynamic row movement to another partition based on the key column update.
 Performance – Performance improvements include parallelism while creating indexes, materialized views, hash joins, and sequential scans to make the operations perform better.
 Stored procedures – SQL stored procedures now added support embedded transactions.
 Support for Just-In-Time (JIT) capability – RDS PostgreSQL 11 instances are created with JIT capability, speeding evaluation of expressions. To enable JIT capability, set the jit parameter to 1 in the PostgreSQL parameter group for the database. 
 Segment size – The write-ahead logging (WAL) segment size has been changed from 16 MB to 64 MB.
 Autovacuum improvements – To provide valuable logging, the parameter rds.force_autovacuum_logging is ON by default in conjunction with the log_autovacuum_min_duration parameter set to 10 seconds. To increase autovacuum effectiveness, the values for the autovacuum_max_workers and autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit parameters are computed based on host memory capacity to provide larger default values.
 Improved transaction timeout – The parameter idle_in_transaction_session_timeout is set to 12 hours. Any session that has been idle more than 12 hours is terminated.
 Performance metrics – The pg_stat_statements module is included in shared_preload_libraries by default. This avoids having to reboot the instance immediately after creation. However, this functionality still requires you to run the statement CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;. Also, track_io_timing is enabled by default to add more granular data to pg_stat_statements.
 The tsearch2 module is no longer supported – If your application uses tsearch2 functions, update it to use the equivalent functions provided by the core PostgreSQL engine. For more information about the tsearch2 module, see PostgreSQL tsearch2.
 The chkpass module is no longer supported – For more information about the chkpass module, see PostgreSQL chkpass.
 Extension updates for RDS PostgreSQL 11.1 include the following: 
   pgaudit is updated to 1.3.0.

For information on upgrading the engine version for your PostgreSQL DB instance, see Upgrading a PostgreSQL DB Instance. 
PostgreSQL version 10.1 includes the following changes: 
 Declarative table partitioning – PostgreSQL 10 adds table partitioning to SQL syntax and native tuple routing. 
 Parallel queries – When you create a new PostgreSQL 10.1 instance, parallel queries are enabled for the default.postgres10 parameter group. The parameter max_parallel_workers_per_gather is set to 2 by default, but you can modify it to support your specific workload requirements.
 Support for the International Components for Unicode (ICU) – You can use the ICU library to provide explicitly versioned collations. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 10.1 is compiled with ICU version 60.2. For more information about ICU implementation in PostgreSQL, see Collation Support.
 Huge pages – Huge pages is a feature of the Linux kernel that uses multiple page size capabilities of modern hardware architectures. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL supports huge pages with a global configuration parameter. When you create a new PostgreSQL 10.1 instance with RDS, the huge_pages parameter is set to "on" for thedefault.postgres10 parameter group. You can modify this setting to support your specific workload requirements. 
 PL/v8 update – PL/v8 is a procedural language that you can use to write functions in JavaScript that you can then call from SQL. This release of PostgreSQL supports version 2.1.0 of PL/v8.
 Renaming of xlog and location – In PostgreSQL version 10 the abbreviation "xlog" has changed to "wal", and the term "location" has changed to "lsn". For more information, see  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.8.4. 
 tsearch2 module – Amazon RDS continues to provide the tsearch2 module in PostgreSQL version 10, but is to remove it in the next major version release. If your application uses tsearch2 functions update it to use the equivalent functions the core engine provides. For more information about using tsearch2, see tsearch2 module.

Beginning with PostgreSQL version 9.5.4 for Amazon RDS, the command ALTER USER WITH BYPASSRLS is supported. 
PostgreSQL versions 9.5.4 and later support event triggers, and Amazon RDS supports event triggers for these versions. You can use the master user account can be used to create, modify, rename, and delete event triggers. Event triggers are at the DB instance level, so they can apply to all databases on an instance. For more information about PostgreSQL event triggers on Amazon RDS, see Event Triggers for PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS.
PostgreSQL Version 9.5.2 on Amazon RDS
PostgreSQL version 9.5.2 contains several fixes to issues found in previous versions. For more information on the features in 9.5.2, see the PostgreSQL documentation. For information on upgrading the engine version for your PostgreSQL DB instance, see Upgrading a PostgreSQL DB Instance.
PostgreSQL version 9.5.2 doesn't support the db.m1 or db.m2 DB instance classes. If you need to upgrade a DB instance running PostgreSQL version 9.4 to version 9.5.2 to one of these instance classes, you need to scale compute. To do that, you need a comparable db.t2 or db.m3 DB instance class before you can upgrade a DB instance running PostgreSQL version 9.4 to version 9.5.2. For more information on DB instance classes, see DB Instance Classes.
Native PostgreSQL version 9.5.2 introduced the command ALTER USER WITH BYPASSRLS. 
This release includes updates from previous versions, including the following:
 CVE-2016-2193: Fixes an issue where a query plan might be reused for more than one ROLE in the same session. Reusing a query plan can cause the query to use the wrong set of Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
 CVE-2016-3065: Fixes a server crash bug triggered by using pageinspect with BRIN index pages. Because an attacker might be able to expose a few bytes of server memory, this crash is being treated as a security issue.
Major enhancements in RDS PostgreSQL 9.5 include the following:
 UPSERT: Allow INSERTs that would generate constraint conflicts to be turned into UPDATEs or ignored
 Add the GROUP BY analysis features GROUPING SETS, CUBE, and ROLLUP
 Add row-level security control
 Create mechanisms for tracking the progress of replication, including methods for identifying the origin of individual changes during logical replication
 Add Block Range Indexes (BRIN)
 Add substantial performance improvements for sorting
 Add substantial performance improvements for multi-CPU machines
 PostGIS 2.2.2 - To use this latest version of PostGIS, use the ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE statement to update after you upgrade to version 9.5.2. Example: 
ALTER EXTENSION POSTGIS UPDATE TO '2.2.2' 
 Improved visibility of autovacuum sessions by allowing the rds_superuser account to view autovacuum sessions in pg_stat_activity. For example, you can identify and terminate an autovacuum session that is blocking a command from running, or running slower than a manually issued vacuum command.
RDS PostgreSQL version 9.5.2 includes the following new extensions:
 address_standardizer – A single-line address parser that takes an input address and normalizes it based on a set of rules stored in a table, helper lex, and gaz tables.
 hstore_plperl – Provides transforms for the hstore type for PL/Perl. 
 tsm_system_rows – Provides the table sampling method SYSTEM_ROWS, which can be used in the TABLESAMPLE clause of a SELECT command.
 tsm_system_time – Provides the table sampling method SYSTEM_TIME, which can be used in the TABLESAMPLE clause of a SELECT command.

Note
PostgreSQL 10.5 added support for the libprotobuf extension version 1.3.0 to the PostGIS component. 
Using the log_fdw Extension
The log_fdw extension is new for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL version 9.6.2 and later. Using this extension, you can access your database engine log using a SQL interface. In addition to viewing the stderr log files that are generated by default on RDS, you can view CSV logs (set the log_destination parameter to csvlog) and build foreign tables with the data neatly split into several columns.
This extension introduces two new functions that make it easy to create foreign tables for database logs:
 list_postgres_log_files() – Lists the files in the database log directory and the file size in bytes.
 create_foreign_table_for_log_file(table_name text, server_name text, log_file_name text) – Builds a foreign table for the specified file in the current database.
All functions created by log_fdw are owned by rds_superuser. Members of the rds_superuser role can grant access to these functions to other database users.
The following example shows how to use the log_fdw extension.
To use the log_fdw extension

Get the log_fdw extension.

postgres=> CREATE EXTENSION log_fdw;
   CREATE EXTENSION

Create the log server as a foreign data wrapper.

postgres=> CREATE SERVER log_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER log_fdw;
   CREATE SERVER

Select all from a list of log files.

postgres=> SELECT * from list_postgres_log_files() order by 1;
A sample response is as follows.
file_name             | file_size_bytes 
   ---------------------------------------------------
    postgresql.log.2016-08-09-22.csv |            1111
    postgresql.log.2016-08-09-23.csv |            1172
    postgresql.log.2016-08-10-00.csv |            1744
    postgresql.log.2016-08-10-01.csv |            1102
   (4 rows)

Create a table with a single 'log_entry' column for non-CSV files.

postgres=> SELECT create_foreign_table_for_log_file('my_postgres_error_log', 
        'log_server', 'postgresql.log.2016-08-09-22.csv');
A sample response is as follows.
```

(1 row)
   ```

Select a sample of the log file. The following code retrieves the log time and error message description.

postgres=> SELECT log_time, message from my_postgres_error_log order by 1;
A sample response is as follows.
log_time             |                                  message

Upgrading PL/v8
If you use PL/v8 and upgrade PostgreSQL to a new PL/v8 version, you immediately take advantage of the new extension. Take the following steps to synchronize your catalog metadata with the new version of PL/v8. These steps are optional, but we highly recommended that you complete them to avoid metadata mismatch warnings.
To synchronize your catalog metadata with a new version of PL/v8

Verify that you need to update. To do this, run the following command while connected to your instance.

select * from pg_available_extensions where name in ('plv8','plls','plcoffee');
If your results contain values for an installed version that is a lower number than the default version, continue with this procedure to update your extensions. 
For example, the following result set indicates that you should update.
name    | default_version | installed_version |                     comment
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   plls    | 2.1.0           | 1.5.3             | PL/LiveScript (v8) trusted procedural language
   plcoffee| 2.1.0           | 1.5.3             | PL/CoffeeScript (v8) trusted procedural language
   plv8    | 2.1.0           | 1.5.3             | PL/JavaScript (v8) trusted procedural language
   (3 rows)

Take a snapshot of your instance as a precaution, because the upgrade drops all your PL/v8 functions. You can continue with the following steps while the snapshot is being created.

For steps to create a snapshot see, Creating a DB Snapshot

Get a count of the number of PL/v8 functions in your DB instance so you can validate that they are all in place after the upgrade. 

The following code returns the number of functions written in PL/v8, plcoffee, or plls.
select proname, nspname, lanname 
   from pg_proc p, pg_language l, pg_namespace n
   where p.prolang = l.oid
   and n.oid = p.pronamespace
   and lanname in ('plv8','plcoffee','plls');

Use pg_dump to create a schema-only dump file.

The following code creates a file on your client machine in the /tmp directory. 
./pg_dump -Fc --schema-only -U master postgres > /tmp/test.dmp
This example uses the following options:
    -FC "format custom"
    --schema-only "will only dump commands necessary to create schema (functions in our case)"
    -U "rds master username"
    database "the database name in our instance"
For more information on pg_dump, see the pg_dump page in the PostgreSQL documentation.

Extract the "CREATE FUNCTION" DDL statement that is present in the dump file.

The following code extracts the DDL statement needed to create the functions. You use this in subsequent steps to recreate the functions. The code uses the grep command to extract the statements to a file.
./pg_restore -l /tmp/test.dmp | grep FUNCTION > /tmp/function_list/
For more information on pg_restore see, pg_restore. 

Drop the functions and extensions.

The following code drops any PL/v8 based objects. The cascade option ensures that any dependent are dropped.
drop extension plv8 cascade;
If your PostgreSQL instance contains objects based on plcoffee or plls, repeat this step for those extensions.

Create the extensions.

The following code creates the PL/v8, plcoffee, and plls extensions.
create extension plv8;

Logical Replication for PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS
Beginning with PostgreSQL version 10.4, RDS supports the publication and subscription SQL Syntax for PostgreSQL 10 Logical Replication.
To enable logical replication for an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance


The AWS user account requires the rds_superuser role to perform logical replication for the PostgreSQL database on Amazon RDS.


Set the rds.logical_replication static parameter to 1. 


Modify the inbound rules of the security group for the publisher instance (production) to allow the subscriber instance (replica) to connect. This is usually done by including the IP address of the subscriber in the security group.


Restart the DB instance for the changes to the static parameter rds.logical_replication to take effect. 


For more information on PostgreSQL logical replication, see the PostgreSQL documentation. 
Logical Decoding and Logical Replication
RDS for PostgreSQL supports the streaming of WAL changes using logical replication slots. Amazon RDS supports logical decoding for a PostgreSQL DB instance version 9.5.4 and higher. You can set up logical replication slots on your instance and stream database changes through these slots to a client such as pg_recvlogical. Logical replication slots are created at the database level and support replication connections to a single database. 
The most common clients for PostgreSQL logical replication are the AWS Database Migration Service or a custom-managed host on an AWS EC2 instance. The logical replication slot knows nothing about the receiver of the stream, and there is no requirement that the target be a replica database. If you set up a logical replication slot and don't read from the slot, data can be written and quickly fill up your DB instance's storage.
PostgreSQL logical replication and logical decoding on Amazon RDS are enabled with a parameter, a replication connection type, and a security role. The client for logical decoding can be any client that is capable of establishing a replication connection to a database on a PostgreSQL DB instance. 
To enable logical decoding for an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance


The user account requires the rds_superuser role to enable logical replication. The user account also requires the rds_replication role to grant permissions to manage logical slots and to stream data using logical slots.


Set the rds.logical_replication static parameter to 1. As part of applying this parameter, we also set the parameters wal_level, max_wal_senders, max_replication_slots, and max_connections. These parameter changes can increase WAL generation, so you should only set the rds.logical_replication parameter when you are using logical slots.


Reboot the DB instance for the static rds.logical_replication parameter to take effect.


Create a logical replication slot as explained in the next section. This process requires that you specify a decoding plugin. Currently we support the test_decoding and wal2json output plugins that ship with PostgreSQL.


For more information on PostgreSQL logical decoding, see the  PostgreSQL documentation.
Working with Logical Replication Slots
You can use SQL commands to work with logical slots. For example, the following command creates a logical slot named test_slot using the default PostgreSQL output plugin test_decoding.
SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('test_slot', 'test_decoding');
The output should be similar to the following.
slot_name    | xlog_position
--------------------------------
regression_slot | 0/16B1970
(1 row)
To list logical slots, use the following command.
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;
To drop a logical slot, use the following command.
SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('test_slot');
The output should be similar to the following.
```
pg_drop_replication_slot

(1 row)
```
For more examples on working with logical replication slots, see  Logical Decoding Examples in the PostgreSQL documentation.
Once you create the logical replication slot, you can start streaming. The following example shows how logical decoding is controlled over the streaming replication protocol, using the program pg_recvlogical included in the PostgreSQL distribution. This requires that client authentication is set up to allow replication connections.
pg_recvlogical -d postgres --slot test_slot -U master 
    --host sg-postgresql1.c6c8mresaghgv0.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com 
    -f -  --start
Event Triggers for PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS
PostgreSQL versions 9.5.4 and later support event triggers, and Amazon RDS supports event triggers for these versions. The master user account can be used to create, modify, rename, and delete event triggers. Event triggers are at the DB instance level, so they can apply to all databases on an instance.
For example, the following code creates an event trigger that prints the current user at the end of every DDL command.
```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION raise_notice_func()
                RETURNS event_trigger
                LANGUAGE plpgsql AS
$$
BEGIN
                RAISE NOTICE 'In trigger function: %', current_user;
END;
$$;
CREATE EVENT TRIGGER event_trigger_1 
                ON ddl_command_end
EXECUTE PROCEDURE raise_notice_func();
```
For more information about PostgreSQL event triggers, see Event Triggers in the PostgreSQL documentation.
There are several limitations to using PostgreSQL event triggers on Amazon RDS. These include:
 You cannot create event triggers on read replicas. You can, however, create event triggers on a read replica source. The event triggers are then copied to the read replica. The event triggers on the read replica don't fire on the read replica when changes are pushed from the source. However, if the read replica is promoted, the existing event triggers fire when database operations occur.
 To perform a major version upgrade to a PostgreSQL DB instance that uses event triggers, you must delete the event triggers before you upgrade the instance.
Huge Pages for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL
Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL supports multiple page sizes for PostgreSQL versions 9.5.6 and later, and 9.6.2 and later. This support includes 4 K and 2 MB page sizes. 
Huge pages reduce overhead when using large contiguous chunks of memory. You allocate huge pages for your application by using calls to mmap or SYSV shared memory. You enable huge pages on an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database by using the huge_pages parameter. Set this parameter to "on" to enable huge pages. 
For PostgreSQL versions 10 and above, huge pages are enabled for all instance classes. For PostgreSQL versions below 10, huge pages are enabled by default for db.r4.*, db.m4.16xlarge, and db.m5.* instance classes. For other instance classes, huge pages are disabled by default. 
When you set the huge_pages parameter to "on," Amazon RDS uses huge pages based on the available shared memory. If the DB instance is unable to use huge pages due to shared memory constraints, Amazon RDS prevents the instance from starting and sets the status of the DB instance to an incompatible parameters state. In this case, you can set the huge_pages parameter to "off" to allow Amazon RDS to start the DB instance.
The shared_buffers parameter is key to setting the shared memory pool that is required for using huge pages. The default value for the shared_buffers parameter is set to a percentage of the total 8K pages available for that instance's memory. When you use huge pages, those pages are allocated in the huge pages collocated together. Amazon RDS puts a DB instance into an incompatible parameters state if the shared memory parameters are set to require more than 90 percent of the DB instance memory. For more information about setting shared memory for PostgreSQL, see the PostgreSQL documentation.
Note
Huge pages are not supported for the db.m1, db.m2, and db.m3 DB instance classes. 
Tablespaces for PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS
Tablespaces are supported in PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS for compatibility; since all storage is on a single logical volume, tablespaces cannot be used for IO splitting or isolation. We have benchmarks and practical experience that shows that a single logical volume is the best setup for most use cases.
Autovacuum for PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS
The PostgreSQL autovacuum feature is turned on by default for new PostgreSQL DB instances. Autovacuum is optional, but we highly recommend that you do not turn autovacuum off. For more information on using autovacuum with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, see Working with PostgreSQL Autovacuum on Amazon RDS.
RAM Disk for the stats_temp_directory
The Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL parameter, rds.pg_stat_ramdisk_size, can be used to specify the system memory allocated to a RAM disk for storing the PostgreSQL stats_temp_directory. The RAM disk parameter is available for all PostgreSQL versions on Amazon RDS. 
Under certain workloads, setting this parameter can improve performance and decrease IO requirements. For more information about the stats_temp_directory, see  the PostgreSQL documentation..
To enable a RAM disk for your stats_temp_directory, set the rds.pg_stat_ramdisk_size parameter to a non-zero value in the parameter group used by your DB instance. The parameter value is in MB. You must reboot the DB instance before the change takes effect.
For example, the following AWS CLI command sets the RAM disk parameter to 256 MB.
aws rds modify-db-parameter-group \
    --db-parameter-group-name pg-95-ramdisk-testing \
    --parameters "ParameterName=rds.pg_stat_ramdisk_size, ParameterValue=256, ApplyMethod=pending-reboot"
After you reboot, run the following command to see the status of the stats_temp_directory:
postgres=>show stats_temp_directory;
The command should return the following: 
```
stats_temp_directory

/rdsdbramdisk/pg_stat_tmp
(1 row)
```
ALTER ENUM for PostgreSQL
Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL versions 9.6.2 and 9.5.6 and later support the ability to alter enumerations. This feature is not available in other versions on Amazon RDS.
The following code shows an example of altering an enum value.
```
postgres=> CREATE TYPE rainbow AS ENUM ('red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'purple');
CREATE TYPE
postgres=> CREATE TABLE t1 (colors rainbow);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('red'), ( 'orange');
INSERT 0 2
postgres=> SELECT * from t1;
colors

red
orange
(2 rows)
postgres=> ALTER TYPE rainbow RENAME VALUE 'red' TO 'crimson';
ALTER TYPE
postgres=> SELECT * from t1;
colors

crimson
orange
(2 rows)
```
Limits for PostgreSQL DB Instances
The following is a list of limitations for PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS:
 You can have up to 40 PostgreSQL DB instances.
 For storage limits, see Amazon RDS DB Instance Storage.
 Amazon RDS reserves up to 3 connections for system maintenance. If you specify a value for the user connections parameter, you need to add 3 to the number of connections that you expect to use. 
Upgrading a PostgreSQL DB Instance
There are two types of upgrades you can manage for your PostgreSQL DB instance:
 OS Updates – Occasionally, Amazon RDS might need to update the underlying operating system of your DB instance to apply security fixes or OS changes. You can decide when Amazon RDS applies OS updates by using the RDS console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or RDS API.
For more information about OS updates, see Applying Updates for a DB Instance.
  Database Engine Upgrades – When Amazon RDS supports a new version of a database engine, you can upgrade your DB instances to the new version. There are two kinds of upgrades: major version upgrades and minor version upgrades. Amazon RDS supports both major and minor version upgrades for PostgreSQL DB instances. 
For more information about PostgreSQL DB engine upgrades, see Upgrading the PostgreSQL DB Engine for Amazon RDS.
Using SSL with a PostgreSQL DB Instance
Amazon RDS supports Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for PostgreSQL DB instances. Using SSL, you can encrypt a PostgreSQL connection between your applications and your PostgreSQL DB instances. You can also force all connections to your PostgreSQL DB instance to use SSL. 
For general information about SSL support and PostgreSQL databases, see SSL Support in the PostgreSQL documentation. For information about using an SSL connection over JDBC, see Configuring the Client in the PostgreSQL documentation.
Topics
 Requiring an SSL Connection to a PostgreSQL DB Instance
 Determining the SSL Connection Status
SSL support is available in all AWS regions for PostgreSQL. Amazon RDS creates an SSL certificate for your PostgreSQL DB instance when the instance is created. If you enable SSL certificate verification, then the SSL certificate includes the DB instance endpoint as the Common Name (CN) for the SSL certificate to guard against spoofing attacks. 
To connect to a PostgreSQL DB instance over SSL

Download the certificate.

For information about downloading certificates, see Using SSL/TLS to Encrypt a Connection to a DB Instance.


Import the certificate into your operating system.


Connect to your PostgreSQL DB instance over SSL.


When you connect using SSL, your client can choose whether to verify the certificate chain. If your connection parameters specify sslmode=verify-ca or sslmode=verify-full, then your client requires the RDS CA certificates to be in their trust store or referenced in the connection URL. This requirement is to verify the certificate chain that signs your database certificate.
When a client, such as psql or JDBC, is configured with SSL support, the client first tries to connect to the database with SSL by default. If the client can't connect with SSL, it reverts to connecting without SSL. The default sslmode mode used is different between libpq-based clients (such as psql) and JDBC. The libpq-based clients default to prefer, and JDBC clients default to verify-full.
Use the sslrootcert parameter to reference the certificate, for example sslrootcert=rds-ssl-ca-cert.pem.
The following is an example of using psql to connect to a PostgreSQL DB instance.
$ psql -h testpg.cdhmuqifdpib.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 \
    "dbname=testpg user=testuser sslrootcert=rds-ca-2019-root.pem sslmode=verify-full"
Requiring an SSL Connection to a PostgreSQL DB Instance
You can require that connections to your PostgreSQL DB instance use SSL by using the rds.force_ssl parameter. By default, the rds.force_ssl parameter is set to 0 (off). You can set the rds.force_ssl parameter to 1 (on) to require SSL for connections to your DB instance. Updating the rds.force_ssl parameter also sets the PostgreSQL ssl parameter to 1 (on) and modifies your DB instance's pg_hba.conf file to support the new SSL configuration.
You can set the rds.force_ssl parameter value by updating the parameter group for your DB instance. If the parameter group for your DB instance isn't the default one, and the ssl parameter is already set to 1 when you set rds.force_ssl to 1, you don't need to reboot your DB instance. Otherwise, you must reboot your DB instance for the change to take effect. For more information on parameter groups, see Working with DB Parameter Groups.
When the rds.force_ssl parameter is set to 1 for a DB instance, you see output similar to the following when you connect, indicating that SSL is now required:
```
$ psql postgres -h SOMEHOST.amazonaws.com -p 8192 -U someuser
. . .
SSL connection (cipher: DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA, bits: 256)
Type "help" for help.
postgres=>
```
Determining the SSL Connection Status
The encrypted status of your connection is shown in the logon banner when you connect to the DB instance:
```
Password for user master: 
psql (10.3) 
SSL connection (cipher: DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA, bits: 256) 
Type "help" for help.   
postgres=>
```
You can also load the sslinfo extension and then call the ssl_is_used() function to determine if SSL is being used. The function returns t if the connection is using SSL, otherwise it returns f.
```
postgres=> create extension sslinfo;
CREATE EXTENSION
postgres=> select ssl_is_used();
 ssl_is_used

t
(1 row)
```
You can use the select ssl_cipher() command to determine the SSL cipher:
```
postgres=> select ssl_cipher();
ssl_cipher

DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
(1 row)
```
If you enable set rds.force_ssl and restart your instance, non-SSL connections are refused with the following message:
$ export PGSSLMODE=disable
$ psql postgres -h SOMEHOST.amazonaws.com -p 8192 -U someuser
psql: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "host.ip", user "someuser", database "postgres", SSL off
$
For information about the sslmode option, see Database Connection Control Functions in the PostgreSQL documentation.
