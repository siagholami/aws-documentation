Upgrading an Oracle DB Snapshot
If you have existing manual DB snapshots, you can upgrade them to a later version of the Oracle database engine. 
When Oracle stops providing patches for a version, and Amazon RDS deprecates the version, you can upgrade your snapshots that correspond to the deprecated version. For more information, see Oracle Engine Version Management. To learn how to upgrade snapshots in preparation for the automatic upgrade of 11.2, see Migrating from SE2 to EE Using Snapshots.
The following snapshot upgrades are currently supported. 




Current Snapshot Version

12.1.0.1
12.1.0.2.v8


11.2.0.4
12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1, 18c, and 19c when the following conditions are met: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]

Console
To upgrade an Oracle DB snapshot


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.


In the navigation pane, choose Snapshots, and then select the DB snapshot that you want to upgrade.


For Actions, choose Upgrade snapshot. The Upgrade snapshot page appears.


Choose the New engine version to upgrade the snapshot to.


(Optional) For Option group, choose the option group for the upgraded DB snapshot. The same option group considerations apply when upgrading a DB snapshot as when upgrading a DB instance. For more information, see Option Group Considerations. 


Choose Save changes to save your changes.


During the upgrade process, all snapshot actions are disabled for this DB snapshot. Also, the DB snapshot status changes from available to upgrading, and then changes to active upon completion. If the DB snapshot can't be upgraded because of snapshot corruption issues, the status changes to unavailable. You can't recover the snapshot from this state. 
Note
If the DB snapshot upgrade fails, the snapshot is rolled back to the original state with the original version.
AWS CLI
To upgrade an Oracle DB snapshot by using the AWS CLI, call the modify-db-snapshot command with the following parameters: 
 --db-snapshot-identifier – The name of the DB snapshot. 
 --engine-version – The version to upgrade the snapshot to. 
You might also need to include the following parameter. The same option group considerations apply when upgrading a DB snapshot as when upgrading a DB instance. For more information, see Option Group Considerations. 
 --option-group-name – The option group for the upgraded DB snapshot. 
Example
The following example upgrades a DB snapshot. 
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  
aws rds modify-db-snapshot \
    --db-snapshot-identifier <mydbsnapshot> \
    --engine-version <11.2.0.4.v12> \
    --option-group-name <default:oracle-se1-11-2>
For Windows:  
aws rds modify-db-snapshot ^
    --db-snapshot-identifier <mydbsnapshot> ^
    --engine-version <11.2.0.4.v12> ^
    --option-group-name <default:oracle-se1-11-2>
RDS API
To upgrade an Oracle DB snapshot by using the Amazon RDS API, call the ModifyDBSnapshot operation with the following parameters: 
 DBSnapshotIdentifier – The name of the DB snapshot. 
 EngineVersion – The version to upgrade the snapshot to. 
You might also need to include the following parameter. The same option group considerations apply when upgrading a DB snapshot as when upgrading a DB instance. For more information, see Option Group Considerations. 
 OptionGroupName – The option group for the upgraded DB snapshot.
