Exporting DB Snapshot Data to Amazon S3
You can export DB snapshot data to an Amazon S3 bucket. After the data is exported, you can analyze the exported data directly through tools like Amazon Athena or Amazon Redshift Spectrum. The export process runs in the background and doesn't affect the performance of your active DB instance.
When you export a DB snapshot, Amazon RDS extracts data from the snapshot and stores it in an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. The data is stored in an Apache Parquet format that is compressed and consistent.
You can export all types of DB and DB cluster snapshots including manual snapshots, automated system snapshots, and snapshots created by the AWS Backup service. By default, all data in the snapshot is exported. However, you can choose to export specific sets of databases, schemas, or tables.
Note
Exporting snapshots from DB instances that use magnetic storage isn't supported.
Exporting snapshots is supported in the following AWS Regions:
 US East (N. Virginia)
 US East (Ohio)
 US West (Oregon)
 Europe (Ireland)
 Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
Note
You can copy a snapshot from an AWS Region where S3 export isn't supported to one where it is supported, then export the copy. The S3 bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the copy.
The following table shows the engine versions that are supported for exporting snapshot data to Amazon S3.




MariaDB
MySQL
PostgreSQL




10.3 10.2.12 and higher 10.1.26 and higher 10.0.32 and higher

Overview of Exporting Snapshot Data
The following procedure provides a high-level view of how to export DB snapshot data to an Amazon S3 bucket. For more details, see the following sections.
To export DB snapshot data to Amazon S3

Identify the snapshot to export. 

Use an existing automated or manual snapshot, or create a manual snapshot of a DB instance.

Set up access to the Amazon S3 bucket.

A bucket is a container for Amazon S3 objects or files. To provide the information to access a bucket, take the following steps:


Identify the S3 bucket where the snapshot is to be exported to. The S3 bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the snapshot. For more information, see Identifying the Amazon S3 Bucket to Export to.


Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) for the server-side encryption. The AWS KMS CMK is used by the snapshot export task to set up AWS KMS server-side encryption when writing the export data to S3. For more information, see Encrypting Amazon RDS Resources.


Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants the snapshot export task access to the S3 bucket. For more information, see Providing Access to an Amazon S3 Bucket Using an IAM Role. 


Export the snapshot to Amazon S3 using the console or the start-export-task CLI command. For more information, see Exporting a Snapshot to an Amazon S3 Bucket. 


To access your exported data in the Amazon S3 bucket, see  Uploading, Downloading, and Managing Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide.


Setting Up Access to an Amazon S3 Bucket
To export DB snapshot data to an Amazon S3 file, you first give the snapshot permission to access the Amazon S3 bucket. You then create an IAM role to allow the Amazon RDS service to write to the Amazon S3 bucket.
Topics
 Identifying the Amazon S3 Bucket to Export to
 Providing Access to an Amazon S3 Bucket Using an IAM Role
Identifying the Amazon S3 Bucket to Export to
Identify the Amazon S3 bucket to export the DB snapshot to. Use an existing S3 bucket or create a new S3 bucket.
Note
The S3 bucket to export to must be in the same AWS Region as the snapshot.
For more information about working with Amazon S3 buckets, see  How Do I View the Properties for an S3 Bucket?,  How Do I Enable Default Encryption for an Amazon S3 Bucket?, and  How Do I Create an S3 Bucket? in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide.
Providing Access to an Amazon S3 Bucket Using an IAM Role
Before you export DB snapshot data to Amazon S3, give the snapshot export tasks write-access permission to the Amazon S3 bucket. 
To do this, create an IAM policy that provides access to the bucket. Then create an IAM role and attach the policy to the role. You later assign the IAM role to your snapshot export task.
Important
If you plan to use the AWS Management Console to export your snapshot, you can choose to create the IAM policy and the role automatically when you export the snapshot. For instructions, see Exporting a Snapshot to an Amazon S3 Bucket.
To give DB snapshot tasks access to Amazon S3

Create an IAM policy. This policy provides the bucket and object permissions that allow your snapshot export task to access Amazon S3. 

Include in the policy the following required actions to allow the transfer of files from Amazon RDS to an S3 bucket: 
    s3:PutObject*
    s3:GetObject* 
    s3:ListBucket 
    s3:DeleteObject*
     s3:GetBucketLocation
Include in the policy the following resources to identify the S3 bucket and objects in the bucket. The following list of resources shows the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for accessing Amazon S3.
    arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket
    arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket/*
For more information on creating an IAM policy for Amazon RDS, see Creating and Using an IAM Policy for IAM Database Access. See also Tutorial: Create and Attach Your First Customer Managed Policy in the IAM User Guide.
The following AWS CLI command creates an IAM policy named ExportPolicy with these options. It grants access to a bucket named your-s3-bucket. 
Note
After you create the policy, note the ARN of the policy. You need the ARN for a subsequent step when you attach the policy to an IAM role. 
aws iam create-policy  --policy-name ExportPolicy --policy-document '{
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:ListBucket",
                    "s3:GetBucketLocation"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:s3:::*"
                ]
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:PutObject*",
                    "s3:GetObject*",
                    "s3:DeleteObject*"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket",
                    "arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
   }'

Create an IAM role. You do this so that Amazon RDS can assume this IAM role on your behalf to access your Amazon S3 buckets. For more information, see Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an IAM User in the IAM User Guide.

The following example shows using the AWS CLI command to create a role named rds-s3-export-role.
aws iam create-role  --role-name rds-s3-export-role  --assume-role-policy-document '{
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
               "Service": "export.rds.amazonaws.com"
             },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
          }
        ] 
      }'

Attach the IAM policy that you created to the IAM role that you created.

The following AWS CLI command attaches the policy created earlier to the role named rds-s3-export-role. Replace your-policy-arn with the policy ARN that you noted in an earlier step. 
aws iam attach-role-policy  --policy-arn your-policy-arn  --role-name rds-s3-export-role
Exporting a Snapshot to an Amazon S3 Bucket
You can have up to five concurrent DB snapshot export tasks in progress per account. 
Note
Exporting RDS snapshots can take a while depending on your database type and size. The export task first restores and scales the entire database before extracting the data to Amazon S3. The task's progress during this phase displays as Starting. When the task switches to exporting data to Amazon S3, progress displays as In progress.
The time it takes for the export to complete depends on the data stored in the database. For example, tables with well distributed numeric primary key or index columns will export the fastest. Tables that don't contain a column suitable for partitioning and tables with only one index on a string-based column will take longer because the export uses a slower single threaded process. 
You can export a DB snapshot to Amazon S3 using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.
Console
To export a DB snapshot


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.


In the navigation pane, choose Snapshots.


From the tabs, choose the type of snapshot that you want to export.


In the list of snapshots, choose the snapshot that you want to export.


For Actions, choose Export to Amazon S3.


The Export to Amazon S3 window appears.


For Export identifier, enter a name to identify the export task. This value is also used for the name of the file created in the S3 bucket.


Choose the amount of data to be exported:
    Choose All to export all data in the snapshot.
    Choose Partial to export specific parts of the snapshot. To identify which parts of the snapshot to export, enter one or more tables for Identifiers. 


For S3 bucket, choose the bucket to export to. 


To assign the exported data to a folder path in the S3 bucket, enter the optional path for S3 prefix.


For IAM role, either choose a role that grants you write access to your chosen S3 bucket, or create a new role. 
    If you created a role by following the steps in Providing Access to an Amazon S3 Bucket Using an IAM Role, choose that role.
    If you didn't create a role that grants you write access to your chosen S3 bucket, choose Create a new role to create the role automatically. Next, enter a name for the role in IAM role name.


For Master key, enter the ARN for the key to use for encrypting the exported data.


Choose Export to Amazon S3.


AWS CLI
To export a DB snapshot to Amazon S3 using the AWS CLI, use the start-export-task command with the following required options:
 --export-task-identifier 
 --source-arn 
 --s3-bucket-name 
 --iam-role-arn 
 --kms-key-id 
In the following examples, the snapshot export task is named my_snapshot_export, which exports a snapshot to an S3 bucket named my_export_bucket.
Example
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  
1. aws rds start-export-task \
2.     --export-task-identifier my_snapshot_export \
3.     --source-arn arn:aws:rds:AWS_Region:123456789012:snapshot:snapshot_name \
4.     --s3-bucket-name my_export_bucket \
5.     --iam-role-arn iam_role \
6.     --kms-key-id master_key
For Windows:  
1. aws rds start-export-task ^
2.     --export-task-identifier my_snapshot_export ^
3.     --source-arn arn:aws:rds:AWS_Region:123456789012:snapshot:snapshot_name ^
4.     --s3-bucket-name my_export_bucket ^
5.     --iam-role-arn iam_role ^
6.     --kms-key-id master_key
Sample output follows.  
{

14. }
RDS API
To cancel a snapshot export task using the Amazon RDS API, use the CancelExportTask operation with the ExportTaskIdentifier parameter.
Troubleshooting PostgreSQL Permissions Errors
When exporting PostgreSQL databases to Amazon S3, you might see a PERMISSIONS_DO_NOT_EXIST error stating that certain tables were skipped. This is usually caused by the superuser, which you specify when creating the DB instance, not having permissions to access those tables.
To fix this error, run the following command:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO superuser_name
For more information on superuser privileges, see Master User Account Privileges.
Data Conversion When Exporting to an Amazon S3 Bucket
When you export a DB snapshot to an Amazon S3 bucket, Amazon RDS converts data to, exports data in, and stores data in the Parquet format. For more information about Parquet, see the Apache Parquet website.
Parquet stores all data as one of the following primitive types:
 BOOLEAN
 INT32
 INT64
 INT96
 FLOAT
 DOUBLE
 BYTE_ARRAY – A variable-length byte array, also known as binary
 FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY – A fixed-length byte array used when the values have a constant size
The Parquet data types are few to reduce the complexity of reading and writing the format. Parquet provides logical types for extending primitive types. A logical type is implemented as an annotation with the data in a LogicalType metadata field. The logical type annotation explains how to interpret the primitive type. 
When the STRING logical type annotates a BYTE_ARRAY type, it indicates that the byte array should be interpreted as a UTF-8 encoded character string. After an export task completes, Amazon RDS notifies you if any string conversion occurred. The underlying data exported is always the same as the data from the source. However, due to the encoding difference in UTF-8, some characters might appear different from the source when read in tools such as Athena.
For more information, see Parquet Logical Type Definitions in the Parquet documentation.
Note
Some characters aren't supported in database table column names. Tables with the following characters in column names are skipped during export.   
,;{}()\n\t=
If the data contains a huge value close to or greater than 500 MB, the export fails.
If the database, schema, or table name contains spaces, partial export isn't supported. However, you can export the entire DB snapshot.
