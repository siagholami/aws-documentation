Rotates the mysql.slow_log table to a backup table. For more information, see MySQL Database Log Files.
Syntax
CALL mysql.rds_rotate_slow_log;
Usage Notes
You can rotate the mysql.slow_log table to a backup table by calling the mysql.rds_rotate_slow_log procedure. When log tables are rotated, the current log table is copied to a backup log table and the entries in the current log table are removed. If a backup log table already exists, then it is deleted before the current log table is copied to the backup. 
You can query the backup log table if needed. The backup log table for the mysql.slow_log table is named mysql.slow_log_backup.
