mysql.rds_start_replication_until
Initiates replication from an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance and stops replication at the specified binary log file location.
Syntax
CALL mysql.rds_start_replication_until (
replication_log_file
  , replication_stop_point
);
Parameters
replication_log_file 
The name of the binary log on the source database instance contains the replication information.
*replication_stop_point * 
The location in the replication_log_file binary log at which replication will stop.
Usage Notes
The master user must run the mysql.rds_start_replication_until procedure.
You can use this procedure with delayed replication for disaster recovery. If you have delayed replication configured, you can use this procedure to roll forward changes to a delayed read replica to the time just before a disaster. After this procedure stops replication, you can promote the read replica to be the new primary DB instance by using the instructions in Promoting a Read Replica to Be a Standalone DB Instance.
You can configure delayed replication using the following stored procedures:
 mysql.rds_set_configuration
 mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_delay
 mysql.rds_set_source_delay
The file name specified for the replication_log_file parameter must match the source database instance binlog file name.
When the replication_stop_point parameter specifies a stop location that is in the past, replication is stopped immediately.
The mysql.rds_start_replication_until procedure is available in these versions of Amazon RDS MySQL:
 MySQL 5.6.40 and later 5.6 versions
 MySQL 5.7.22 and later 5.7 versions
Examples
The following example initiates replication and replicates changes until it reaches location 120 in the mysql-bin-changelog.000777 binary log file.
call mysql.rds_start_replication_until(
  'mysql-bin-changelog.000777',
  120);
