# Modifying an Amazon RDS DB Instance<a name="Overview.DBInstance.Modifying"></a>

You can change the settings of a DB instance to accomplish tasks such as adding additional storage or changing the DB instance class\. In this topic, you can find out how to modify an Amazon RDS DB instance and learn about the settings for DB instances\. 

We recommend that you test any changes on a test instance before modifying a production instance, so that you fully understand the impact of each change\. Testing is especially important when upgrading database versions\. 

Most modifications to a DB instance you can either apply immediately or defer until the next maintenance window\. Some modifications, such as parameter group changes, require that you manually reboot your DB instance for the change to take effect\. 

**Important**  
Some modifications result in an outage because Amazon RDS must reboot your DB instance for the change to take effect\. Review the impact to your database and applications before modifying your DB instance settings\. 

## Console<a name="USER_ModifyInstance.Console"></a>

**To modify a DB instance**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose the DB instance that you want to modify\. 

1. Choose **Modify**\. The **Modify DB Instance** page appears\.

1. Change any of the settings that you want\. For information about each setting, see [Settings for DB Instances](#USER_ModifyInstance.Settings)\. 

1. When all the changes are as you want them, choose **Continue** and check the summary of modifications\. 

1. \(Optional\) Choose **Apply immediately** to apply the changes immediately\. Choosing this option can cause an outage in some cases\. For more information, see [Using the Apply Immediately Setting](#USER_ModifyInstance.ApplyImmediately)\. 

1. On the confirmation page, review your changes\. If they are correct, choose **Modify DB Instance** to save your changes\. 

   Or choose **Back** to edit your changes or **Cancel** to cancel your changes\. 

## AWS CLI<a name="USER_ModifyInstance.CLI"></a>

To modify a DB instance by using the AWS CLI, call the [modify\-db\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html) command\. Specify the DB instance identifier and the values for the options that you want to modify\. For information about each option, see [Settings for DB Instances](#USER_ModifyInstance.Settings)\. 

**Example**  
The following code modifies `mydbinstance` by setting the backup retention period to 1 week \(7 days\)\. The code enables deletion protection by using `--deletion-protection`\. To disable deletion protection, use `--no-deletion-protection`\. The changes are applied during the next maintenance window by using `--no-apply-immediately`\. Use `--apply-immediately` to apply the changes immediately\. For more information, see [Using the Apply Immediately Setting](#USER_ModifyInstance.ApplyImmediately)\.   
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  

```
aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --backup-retention-period 7 \
    --deletion-protection \
    --no-apply-immediately
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --backup-retention-period 7 ^
    --deletion-protection ^
    --no-apply-immediately
```

## RDS API<a name="USER_ModifyInstance.API"></a>

To modify a DB instance by using the Amazon RDS API, call the [ModifyDBInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBInstance.html) operation\. Specify the DB instance identifier, and the parameters for the settings that you want to modify\. For information about each parameter, see [Settings for DB Instances](#USER_ModifyInstance.Settings)\. 

## Using the Apply Immediately Setting<a name="USER_ModifyInstance.ApplyImmediately"></a>

When you modify a DB instance, you can apply the changes immediately\. To apply changes immediately, you choose the **Apply Immediately** option in the AWS Management Console\. Or you use the `--apply-immediately` parameter when calling the AWS CLI or set the `ApplyImmediately` parameter to `true` when using the Amazon RDS API\. 

If you don't choose to apply changes immediately, the changes are put into the pending modifications queue\. During the next maintenance window, any pending changes in the queue are applied\. If you choose to apply changes immediately, your new changes and any changes in the pending modifications queue are applied\. 

**Important**  
If any of the pending modifications require downtime, choosing the apply immediately option can cause unexpected downtime\.   
When you choose to apply a change immediately, any pending modifications are also applied immediately, instead of during the next maintenance window\.   
If you don't want a pending change to be applied in the next maintenance window, you can modify the DB instance to revert the change\. You can do this by using the AWS CLI and specifying the `--apply-immediately` option\.

Changes to some database settings are applied immediately, even if you choose to defer your changes\. To see how the different database settings interact with the apply immediately setting, see [Settings for DB Instances](#USER_ModifyInstance.Settings)\.

## Settings for DB Instances<a name="USER_ModifyInstance.Settings"></a>

In the following table, you can find details about which settings you can and can't modify, when changes can be applied, and whether the changes cause downtime for your DB instance\. 

You can modify a DB instance using the console, the [ `modify-db-instance`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html) CLI command, or the [ `ModifyDBInstance`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBInstance.html) RDS API operation\.

| Console Setting and Description | CLI Option and RDS API Parameter | When the Change Occurs | Downtime Notes | Supported DB Engines | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  **Allocated storage** The storage, in gibibytes, that you want to allocate for your DB instance\. You can only increase the allocated storage\. You can't reduce the allocated storage\. You can't modify the storage of some older DB instances, or DB instances restored from older DB snapshots\. The **Allocated storage** setting is disabled in the console if your DB instance isn't eligible\. You can check whether you can allocate more storage by using the CLI command [describe\-valid\-db\-instance\-modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-valid-db-instance-modifications.html)\. This command returns the valid storage options for your DB instance\.  You can't modify allocated storage if the DB instance status is **storage\-optimization** or if the allocated storage for the DB instance has been modified in the last six hours\. The maximum storage allowed depends on your DB engine and the storage type\.
