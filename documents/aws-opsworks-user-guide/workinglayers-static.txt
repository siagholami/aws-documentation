Static Web Server AWS OpsWorks Stacks Layer
Note
This layer is available only for Linux-based stacks.
The Static Web Server layer is an AWS OpsWorks Stacks layer that provides a template for instances to serve static HTML pages, which can include client-side scripting. This layer is based on Nginx.
Installation: Nginx is installed in /usr/sbin/nginx.
The Add Layer page provides the following configuration options:
Custom security groups
This setting appears if you chose to not automatically associate a built-in AWS OpsWorks Stacks security group with your layers. You must specify which security group to associate with the layer. For more information, see Create a New Stack.
Elastic Load Balancer
You can attach an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to the layer's instances.
You can modify some Nginx configuration settings by using custom JSON or a custom attributes file. For more information, see Overriding Attributes. For a list of Apache attributes that can be overridden, see nginx Attributes.
Important
If your web application uses SSL, we recommend that you disable SSLv3 if possible to address the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2014-3566. 
To disable SSLv3, you must modify the Nginx server's nginx.conf file. To do so, override the built-in nginx cookbook's nginx.conf.erb template file, which the Rails App Server layer's Setup recipes use to create nginx.conf, and add the following directive:  
ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
For more information on how to configure nginx.conf, see Configuring HTTPS servers. For more information on how to override a built-in template, see Using Custom Templates.
