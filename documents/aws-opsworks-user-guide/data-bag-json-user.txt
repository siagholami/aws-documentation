User Data Bag (aws_opsworks_user)
Represents a user's settings.
The following example shows how to use Chef search to search through a single data bag item and then multiple data bag items to write messages to the Chef log with the users' user names and Amazon Resource Names (ARNs):
```
user = search("aws_opsworks_user").first
Chef::Log.info("* The user's user name is '#{user['username']}' *")
Chef::Log.info("* The user's user ARN is '#{user['iam_user_arn']}' *")
Or...
search("aws_opsworks_user").each do |user|
  Chef::Log.info("* The user's user name is '#{user['username']}' *")
  Chef::Log.info("* The user's user ARN is '#{user['iam_user_arn']}' *")
end
```
