Update a Stack
After you have created a stack, you can update the configuration at any time. On the Stack page, click Stack Settings, and then click Edit, which displays the Settings page. Make the changes that you want and click Save.
The settings are the same as those discussed in Create a New Stack. Refer to that topic for details. However, note the following:
 You cannot modify the region or VPC ID.
 If your stack is running in a VPC, the settings include a Default subnet setting, which lists the VPC's subnets. If your stack is not running in a VPC, the setting is labeled Default Availability Zones, and lists the region's Availability Zones.
 You can change the default operating system, but you cannot specify a Linux operating system for a Windows stack, or Windows for a Linux stack.
 If you change any of the default instance settings, such as Hostname theme or Default SSH key, the new values apply only to any new instances you create, not to existing instances.
 Changing the Name changes the name that is displayed by the console; it does not change the underlying short name that AWS OpsWorks Stacks uses to identify the stack.
 Before you change Use OpsWorks security groups from Yes to No, each layer must have at least one security group in addition to the layer's built-in security group. For more information, see Editing an OpsWorks Layer's Configuration. 
AWS OpsWorks Stacks then deletes the built-in security groups from every layer.
 If you change Use OpsWorks security groups from No to Yes, AWS OpsWorks Stacks adds the appropriate built-in security group to each layer but does not delete the existing security groups.
