Layer Data Bag (aws_opsworks_layer)
Represents a layer's settings.
The following example shows how to use Chef search to search through a single data bag item and then multiple data bag items to write messages to the Chef log with the layers' names and short names:
```
layer = search("aws_opsworks_layer").first
Chef::Log.info("* The layer's name is '#{layer['name']}' *")
Chef::Log.info("* The layer's shortname is '#{layer['shortname']}' *")
search("aws_opsworks_layer").each do |layer|
  Chef::Log.info("* The layer's name is '#{layer['name']}' *")
  Chef::Log.info("* The layer's shortname is '#{layer['shortname']}' *")
end
```
