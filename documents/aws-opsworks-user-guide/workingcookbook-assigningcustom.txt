Automatically Running Recipes
Each layer has a set of built-in recipes assigned to each lifecycle event, although some layers lack Undeploy recipes. When a lifecycle event occurs on an instance, AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs the appropriate set of recipes for the associated layer.
If you have installed custom cookbooks, you can have AWS OpsWorks Stacks run some or all of the recipes automatically by assigning each recipe to a layer's lifecycle event. After an event occurs, AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs the specified custom recipes after the layer's built-in recipes. 
To assign custom recipes to layer events


On the Layers page, for the appropriate layer, click Recipes and then click Edit. If you haven't yet enabled custom cookbooks, click configure cookbooks to open the stack's Settings page. Toggle Use custom Chef Cookbooks to Yes, and provide the cookbook's repository information. Then click Save and navigate back to the edit page for the Recipes tab. For more information, see Installing Custom Cookbooks.


On the Recipes tab, enter each custom recipe in the appropriate event field and click  to add it to the list. Specify a recipe as follows: cookbook::somerecipe (omit the .rb extension). 



When you start a new instance, AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically runs the custom recipes for each event, after it runs the standard recipes.
Note
Custom recipes execute in the order that you enter them in the console. An alternative way to control execution order is to implement a meta recipe that executes the recipes in the correct order.
