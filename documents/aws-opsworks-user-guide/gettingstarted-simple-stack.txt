Step 2.1: Create a Stack - Chef 11
You start an AWS OpsWorks Stacks project by creating a stack, which acts as a container for your instances and other resources. The stack configuration specifies some basic settings, such as the AWS region and the default operating system, that are shared by all the stack's instances.
Note

To create a new stack



Add a Stack
Sign into the AWS OpsWorks Stacks console. If the account has no existing stacks, you will see the Welcome to AWS OpsWorks page; click Add your first stack. Otherwise, you will see the AWS OpsWorks Stacks dashboard, which lists your account's stacks; click Add Stack.




Configure the Stack
On the Add Stack page, choose Chef 11 stack and specify the following settings:
Stack name
Enter a name for your stack, which can contain alphanumeric characters (a–z, A–Z, and 0–9), and hyphens (-). The example stack for this walkthrough is named MyStack.
Region
Select US West (Oregon) as the stack's region.
Accept the default values for the other settings and click Add Stack. For more information on the various stack settings, see Create a New Stack.
