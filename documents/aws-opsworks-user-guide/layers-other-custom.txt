Custom Layer Reference
If the standard layers don't suit your requirements, you can create a custom layer. A stack can have multiple custom layers. By default, the custom layer runs a limited set of standard recipes that support basic functionality. You then implement the layer's primary functionality by implementing a set of custom Chef recipes for each of the appropriate lifecycle events to set up and configure the layer's software, and so on. Custom recipes run after the standard AWS OpsWorks Stacks recipes for each event. 
Short name: User-defined; each custom layer in a stack must have a different short name
Open ports: By default, a custom server layer opens public access to ports 22(SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and all ports from the stack's Rails and PHP application server layers
Autoassign Elastic IP Addresses: Off by default
Default EBS volume: No
Default Security Group: AWS-OpsWorks-Custom-Server
Compatibility: Custom layers are compatible with the following layers: custom, db-master, lb, memcached, monitoring-master, nodejs-app, php-app, rails-app, and web
Configuration: To configure a custom layer, you must specify the following:
 The layer's name
 The layer's short name, which identifies the layer in Chef recipes and must use only a-z and numbers
For Linux stacks, the custom layer uses the following recipes.
Setup recipes:
  opsworks_initial_setup
 ssh_host_keys
 ssh_users
 mysql::client
 dependencies
 ebs
 opsworks_ganglia::client
Configure recipes:
 opsworks_ganglia::configure-client
 ssh_users
 agent_version 
Deploy recipes:
 deploy::default
Shutdown recipes:
 opsworks_shutdown::default
