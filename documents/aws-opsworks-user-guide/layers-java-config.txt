Custom Configuration
AWS OpsWorks Stacks exposes additional configuration settings as built-in attributes, which are all in the opsworks_java namespace. You can use custom JSON or a custom attributes file to override the built-in attributes and specify custom values. For example, the JVM and Tomcat versions are represented by the built-in jvm_version and java_app_server_version attributes, both of which are set to 7. You can use custom JSON or a custom attributes file to set either or both to 6. The following example uses custom JSON to set both attributes to 6:
{
  "opsworks_java": {
    "jvm_version": 6,
    "java_app_server_version" : 6
  }
}
For more information, see Using Custom JSON.
Another example of custom configuration is installing a custom JDK by overriding the use_custom_pkg_location, custom_pkg_location_url_debian, and custom_pkg_location_url_rhel attributes. 
Note
If you override the built-in cookbooks, you will need to update those components yourself.
