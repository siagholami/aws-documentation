Instance Registration Policies
The AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI_EC2 and AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI_OnPremises policies provide the correct permissions for registering EC2 and on-premises instances, respectively. You add AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI_EC2 to your IAM user to register EC2 instances, but add AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI_OnPremises to your IAM user to register on-premises instances. To use these policies, you must be running at least version 1.16.180 of the AWS CLI or newer.
The AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI_EC2 Policy
Add AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI_EC2 to your IAM user to register EC2 instances. You should use this profile if you plan to register only EC2 instances. When you use this policy, permissions are provided by the EC2 instance's instance profile.

The AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI_OnPremises Policy
Add AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI_OnPremises to your IAM user to register on-premises instances. This policy includes IAM permissions, such as AttachUserPolicy, but the resources on which those permissions work are restricted.

(Deprecated) The AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI Policy
Important
The AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI policy has been deprecated, and cannot be used to register new instances. It is available only for backward compatibility on instances that have already been registered. The AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI policy includes many IAM permissions including CreateUser, PutUserPolicy, and AddUserToGroup. Because these are administrator-level permissions, you should only assign the AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI policy to trusted administrative users.
The following example shows the AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI policy, which grants permissions to run register for on-premises instances. To register Amazon EC2 instances, we recommend that you use AWSOpsWorksRegisterCLI_EC2 instead.
