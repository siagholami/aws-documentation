Reset Chef Automate Dashboard Credentials
Periodically, you might want to change the password with which you sign in to the Chef Automate dashboard. You can also use the Amazon EC2 Systems Manager AWS CLI command that's documented in this section to change the Chef Automate dashboard password if you have lost it. 

To return the instance ID of your Chef server, open the AWS Management Console to the following page. 

https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=region_of_your_server#Instances:search=aws-opsworks-cm-server_name
For example, for a Chef server named MyChefServer in the US West (Oregon) Region, the console URL would be the following.
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#Instances:search=aws-opsworks-cm-MyChefServer
Make a note of the instance ID that is displayed in the console; you will need it to change your password.

To reset the Chef Automate dashboard sign-in password, run the following AWS CLI command. Replace enterprise_name with your enterprise or organization name, user_name with the IAM user name of an administrator on the server, new_password with the password you want to use, andregion_name with the region in which your server is located. If you do not specify an enterprise name, the enterprise name will be default. By default, enterprise_name is default (this is the name of the organization that is always provisioned). For user_name, AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate only creates a user named admin. Make a note of the new password, and store it in a safe but convenient location.

aws ssm send-command --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" --comment "reset admin password" --instance-ids "instance_id" 
   --parameters commands="sudo delivery-ctl reset-password enterprise_name user_name new_password" --region region_name --output text

Wait for output text (in this case, the command ID) to show that the password change is finished.
