Step 8 (Optional): Clean Up
To prevent incurring additional charges to your AWS account, you can delete the AWS resources that were used for this walkthrough. These AWS resources include the AWS OpsWorks Stacks stack and the stack's components. (For more information, see AWS OpsWorks Pricing.)

If you want to keep these AWS resources available, you have now completed this walkthrough, and you can skip to Next Steps.
