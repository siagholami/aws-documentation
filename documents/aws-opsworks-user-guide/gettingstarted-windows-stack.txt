Step 2.1: Create the Stack
You start an AWS OpsWorks Stacks project by creating a stack, which acts as a container for your instances and other resources. The stack configuration specifies some basic settings, such as the AWS region and the default operating system, that are shared by all the stack's instances. 
To create a new stack



Add a Stack
If you haven't done so already, sign in to the AWS OpsWorks Stacks console.
    If the account has no existing stacks, you will see the Welcome to AWS OpsWorks page; choose Add your first stack.
    Otherwise, you will see the AWS OpsWorks Stacks dashboard, which lists your account's stacks; choose Add Stack.



Configure the Stack
On the Add Stack page, choose Chef 12 stack and specify the following settings:
Stack name
Enter a name for your stack, which can contain alphanumeric characters (a–z, A–Z, and 0–9), and hyphens (-). The example stack for this walkthrough is named IISWalkthrough.
Region
Select US West (Oregon) as the stack's region.
You can create a stack in any region, but we recommend US West (Oregon) for tutorials.
Default operating system
Choose Windows, and then specify Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base, which is the default setting.
Use custom Chef cookbooks
For the purposes of this walkthrough, specify No for this option.


Choose Advanced to confirm that you have an IAM role and the default IAM instance profile selected.
IAM role
Specify the stack's IAM (AWS Identity and Access Management) role. AWS OpsWorks Stacks needs to access other AWS services to perform tasks such as creating and managing Amazon EC2 instances. IAM role specifies the role that AWS OpsWorks Stacks assumes to work with other AWS services on your behalf. For more information, see Allowing AWS OpsWorks Stacks to Act on Your Behalf.
    If your account has an existing AWS OpsWorks Stacks IAM role, you can select it from the list.
If the role was created by AWS OpsWorks Stacks, it will be named aws-opsworks-service-role.
    Otherwise, select New IAM Role to direct AWS OpsWorks Stacks to create a new role for you with the correct permissions. 
Note: If you have AWS OpsWorks Stacks Full Access permissions, creating a new role requires several additional IAM permissions. For more information, see Example Policies.


Accept the default values for the other settings and choose Add Stack. For more information on the various stack settings, see Create a New Stack.
