# Sign in to the Puppet Enterprise Console<a name="opspup-puppet-dashboard"></a>

After you have downloaded the sign\-in credentials from the Puppet master's Properties page, and the server is online, sign in to the Puppet Enterprise console\. In this walkthrough, we instructed you to specify your control repository that contains your modules, and add at least one node to manage\. This allows you to see information about the agent and nodes in the console\.

The Puppet Enterprise console uses a certificate signed by PEâ€™s built\-in certificate authority \(CA\)\. Because this CA is specific to PE, your browser might not trust it, and you might have to add a security exception to access the console\. For more information about troubleshooting certificate errors and adding exceptions in common web browsers, see the following\.

## Group and Classify Nodes<a name="w4ab1b7c19c15c11"></a>

Before you specify the desired configuration of your nodes by applying classes to them, group the nodes according to their roles in your enterprise or their common characteristics\. Grouping and classifying nodes involves the following high\-level tasks\. You can complete these tasks by using the PE console\. For detailed information about how to group and classify your nodes, see [Grouping and classifying nodes](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2017.3/managing_nodes/grouping_and_classifying_nodes.html) in the Puppet Enterprise documentation\.

1. Create node groups\.

1. Add nodes to groups manually or automatically by applying rules that you create\.

1. Assign classes to node groups\.

## Reset Administrator and User Passwords<a name="w4ab1b7c19c15c13"></a>

For information about how to change the password that you use to sign in to the Puppet Enterprise console, see [Reset the Admin Password](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2017.3/accessing_console/console_accessing.html#reset-the-admin-password) in the Puppet Enterprise documentation\.

By default, after ten sign\-in attempts, users are locked out of the Puppet console\. For more information about how to reset user passwords in the event of a lockout, see [Password endpoints](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2017.3/api_rbac_activity/rbac_api_v1_password.html) in the Puppet Enterprise documentation\.
