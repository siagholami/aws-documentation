Logging AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise API Calls with AWS CloudTrail
AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise is integrated with CloudTrail, a service that captures all of the AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise API calls and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. CloudTrail captures API calls from the AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise console, or from your code to the AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise APIs. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise, the source IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. 
To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to configure and enable it, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise Information in CloudTrail
When CloudTrail logging is enabled in your AWS account, API calls made to AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise actions are tracked in CloudTrail log files, where they are written with other AWS service records. CloudTrail determines when to create and write to a new file based on a time period and file size.
All AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise actions are logged by CloudTrail and are documented in the AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise API Reference. For example, calls to the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks-cm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateServer.html, http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks-cm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateBackup.html, and http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks-cm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeServers.html APIs generate entries in the CloudTrail log files.
Every log entry contains information about who generated the request. The user identity information in the log entry helps you determine the following:


Whether the request was made with root or IAM user credentials


Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a role or federated user


Whether the request was made by another AWS service


For more information, see the CloudTrail userIdentity Element.
You can store your log files in your Amazon S3 bucket for as long as you want, but you can also define Amazon S3 lifecycle rules to archive or delete log files automatically. By default, your log files are encrypted with Amazon S3 server-side encryption (SSE).
If you want to be notified about log file delivery, you can configure CloudTrail to publish Amazon SNS notifications when new log files are delivered. For more information, see Configuring Amazon SNS Notifications for CloudTrail.
You can also aggregate AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise log files from multiple AWS regions and multiple AWS accounts into a single Amazon S3 bucket. 
For more information, see Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Regions and Receiving CloudTrail Log Files from Multiple Accounts.
Understanding AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise Log File Entries
CloudTrail log files can contain one or more log entries. Each entry lists multiple JSON-formatted events. A log entry represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time of the action, request parameters, and so on. Log entries are not an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they do not appear in any specific order. 
The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry for an AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise CreateServer action.
