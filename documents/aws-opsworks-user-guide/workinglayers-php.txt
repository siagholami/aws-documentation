PHP App Server AWS OpsWorks Stacks Layer
Note
This layer is available only for Linux-based stacks.
The PHP App Server layer is an AWS OpsWorks Stacks layer that provides a blueprint for instances that function as PHP application servers. The PHP App Server layer is based on Apache2 with mod_php and has no standard configuration options. The PHP and Apache version depends on which operating system you specify for the layer's instances.

Installation: AWS OpsWorks Stacks uses the instance's package installer to install Apache2 and mod_php in their default locations. For more information about installation, see Apache.
The Add Layer page provides the following configuration options:
Custom security groups
This setting appears if you chose to not automatically associate a built-in AWS OpsWorks Stacks security group with your layers. You must specify which security group to associate with the layer. For more information, see Create a New Stack.
Elastic Load Balancer
You can attach an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to the layer's instances.
You can modify some Apache configuration settings by using custom JSON or a custom attributes file. For more information, see Overriding Attributes. For a list of Apache attributes that can be overridden, see apache2 Attributes.
For an example of how to deploy a PHP App, including how to connect the app to a backend database, see Getting Started with Chef 11 Linux Stacks.
Important
If your PHP application uses SSL, we recommend that you disable SSLv3 if possible to address the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2014-3566. To do so, you must modify the SSLProtocol setting in the Apache server's ssl.conf file. For more information on how to modify this setting, see Disabling SSLv3 for Apache Servers.
