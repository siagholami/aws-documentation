Amazon RDS Data Bag (aws_opsworks_rds_db_instance)
A set of data bag content that specifies an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance's configuration as follows:











address
db_instance_identifier
db_password


db_user
engine
rds_db_instance_arn


region





The following example shows how to use Chef search to search through a single data bag item and then multiple data bag items to write messages to the Chef log with the Amazon RDS instances' addresses and database engine types:
```
rds_db_instance = search("aws_opsworks_rds_db_instance").first
Chef::Log.info("* The RDS instance's address is '#{rds_db_instance['address']}' *")
Chef::Log.info("* The RDS instance's database engine type is '#{rds_db_instance['engine']}' *")
search("aws_opsworks_rds_db_instance").each do |rds_db_instance|
  Chef::Log.info("* The RDS instance's address is '#{rds_db_instance['address']}' *")
  Chef::Log.info("* The RDS instance's database engine type is '#{rds_db_instance['engine']}' *")
end
```
