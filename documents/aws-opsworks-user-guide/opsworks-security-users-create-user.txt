Creating IAM Users for AWS OpsWorks Stacks
Before you can import IAM users into AWS OpsWorks Stacks, you need to create them. You can do this using the IAM console, command line, or API. For full instructions, see Adding an IAM User in Your AWS Account.
Note that unlike administrative users, you don't need to attach a policy to define permissions. You can set permissions after importing the users into AWS OpsWorks Stacks, as explained in Managing User Permissions. 
For more information on creating IAM users and groups, see IAM Getting Started.
