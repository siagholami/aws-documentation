ruby Attributes
Note
These attributes are available only on Linux stacks.
The ruby attributes specify the Ruby version that is used by applications. Note that attribute usage changed with the introduction of semantic versioning in Ruby 2.1. For more information about how to specify a version, including examples, see Ruby Versions. For complete details on how AWS OpsWorks Stacks determines the Ruby version, see the built-in attributes file, ruby.rb. For more information on how to override built-in attributes to specify custom values, see Overriding Attributes.
full_version 
The full version number (string). You should not override this attribute. Instead, use [:opsworks][:ruby_version] and the appropriate patch version attribute to specify a version.  
[:ruby][:full_version]
major_version 
The major version number (string). You should not override this attribute. Instead, use [:opsworks][:ruby_version] to specify the major version.  
[:ruby][:major_version]
minor_version 
The minor version number (string). You should not override this attribute. Instead, use [:opsworks][:ruby_version] to specify the minor version.  
[:ruby][:minor_version]
patch 
The patch level (string). This attribute is valid for Ruby version 2.0.0 and earlier. For later Ruby versions, use the patch_version attribute.  
[:ruby][:patch]
The patch number must be prefaced by p. For example, you would use the following custom JSON to specify patch level 484.  
{
  "ruby":{"patch":"p484"}
}
patch_version 
The patch number (string). This attribute is valid for Ruby version 2.1 and later. For earlier Ruby versions, use the patch attribute.  
[:ruby][:patch_version]
pkgrelease 
The package release number (string).  
[:ruby][:pkgrelease]
