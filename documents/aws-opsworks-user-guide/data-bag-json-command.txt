Command Data Bag (aws_opsworks_command)
Represents settings for a command that AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs on one or more instances.
The following example shows how to use Chef search to search through a single data bag item and then multiple data bag items to write messages to the Chef log with the commands' types and when they were sent:
```
command = search("aws_opsworks_command").first
Chef::Log.info("* The command's type is '#{command['type']}' *")
Chef::Log.info("* The command was sent at '#{command['sent_at']}' *")
search("aws_opsworks_command").each do |command|
  Chef::Log.info("* The command's type is '#{command['type']}' *")
  Chef::Log.info("* The command was sent at '#{command['sent_at']}' *")
end
```
