On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select your load balancer.


On the Description tab, choose Configure Access Logs.

To disable access logging using the AWS CLI
Use the following modify-load-balancer-attributes command to disable access logging:

The following is an example response:
{
    "LoadBalancerName": "my-loadbalancer",
    "LoadBalancerAttributes": {
        "AccessLog": {
            "S3BucketName": "my-loadbalancer-logs",
            "EmitInterval": 60,
            "Enabled": false,
            "S3BucketPrefix": "my-app"
        }
    }
}
