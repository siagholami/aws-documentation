Troubleshoot a Classic Load Balancer: API errors
The following are error messages returned by Elastic Load Balancing API, the potential causes, and the steps you can take to resolve the issues.
Topics
 CertificateNotFound: Undefined
 OutofService: A transient error occurred
CertificateNotFound: Undefined
Cause 1: There is a delay in propagating the certificate to all Regions when it is created using the AWS Management Console. When this delay occurs, the error message is shown in the last step in the process of creating the load balancer.
Solution 1: Wait approximately 15 minutes and then try again. If the problem persists, go to the AWS Support Center for assistance.
Cause 2: If you are using the AWS CLI or API directly, you can receive this error if you provide an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a certificate that does not exist.
Solution 2: Use the Identity and Access Management (IAM) action GetServerCertificate to get the certificate ARN and verify that you provided the correct value for the ARN.
OutofService: A transient error occurred
Cause: There is a transient internal problem within the Elastic Load Balancing service or the underlying network. This temporary issue might also occur when Elastic Load Balancing queries the health of the load balancer and its registered instances.
Solution: Retry the API call. If the problem persists, go to the AWS Support Center for assistance.
