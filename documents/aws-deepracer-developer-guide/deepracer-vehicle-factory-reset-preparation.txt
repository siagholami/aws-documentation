Preparing for the Factory Reset of Your AWS DeepRacer Vehicle

Resetting your AWS DeepRacer completely wipes the data on the device and returns it to its factory settings. To prepare, there are steps you need to take that require additional hardware. This topic explains what you need to get started and walks you through the process.
Prerequisites
Before you get started make sure you have the following items ready:
 1 USB flash drive, 32 GB or larger
 A computer to facilitate preparation - Choose one of the following options: 
   Option 1: Set up your AWS DeepRacer compute module as a Linux computer with a mouse, keyboard, monitor (connect with HDMI type A cable) 
   Option 2: Connect AWS DeepRacer to an Ubuntu, MacOS, or Windows computer
 An AWS DeepRacer vehicle 
Important
Confirm which AWS DeepRacer hardware model you are resetting to insure you download the correct image and factory reset file
   A: Vehicles ordered from amazon.com have a white "AWS" logo on the chassis - use 0.0.8 BIOS path
   B: Vehicles originating from re:Invent 2018 have no text on the chassis - use 0.0.6 BIOS path

Preparation
To prepare for the factory reset, perform the following tasks.
 Format the USB drive into the following two partitions.
   FAT32 of 2 GB
   NTFS of at least 16 GB
 Make the USB drive bootable to start the factory reset on reboot.
   Burn the required custom Ubuntu ISO image to the FAT32 partition.
   Copy the required factory restore files to the NTFS partition of the USB drive.
Depending on the computer you use, specific tasks may differ from one operating system to another. We present step-by-step instructions to prepare your USB drive using Ubuntu (via the computer module of the AWS DeepRacer vehicle), MacOS, and Windows operating systems.
The instructions for using other Linux or Unix computers are similar to the Ubuntu instructions discussed in the following section. You need to replace the apt-get commands with the corresponding commands supported by the other Linux or Unix system that you choose to use instead. 
Choose one of the following procedures according to the type of computer you use.
Partition a USB Drive and Make it Bootable by Using an Ubuntu Computer
In the following steps, use the AWS DeepRacer vehicle computer module as an Ubuntu computer. The same instructions apply to a Linux computer running Ubuntu. The instructions on other flavors of Linux or Unix operating systems are similar. Just replace the apt-get * commands with their corresponding commands supported by the other Linux or Unix system of your choosing. 
To partition the USB drive and make it bootable


To format the USB drive by running Ubuntu commands on the AWS DeepRacer vehicle or a computer running Ubuntu, do the following.


On the AWS DeepRacer vehicle compute module, run the following commands to install and launch GParted.
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install gparted
  sudo gparted



On the newly created GParted console, choose /dev/sda in the drop-down menu on the top-right corner and then delete all existing partitions.
If the partitions are locked, open the context (right-click) menu and choose unmount.


To create the FAT32 partition of 2 GB capacity, choose the file icon on the top-left, set the parameters similar to the following, and then choose Add. 
Free space preceding: 1
New size:2048
Free space following: 27951
Align to: MiB
Create as: Primary Partition
Partition name:: 
File system: fat32
Label: BOOT



To create the NTFS partition of at least 16 GB capacity, choose the file icon again, set the parameters similar to the following, and choose Add.
Free space preceding: 0
New size:27951
Free space following: 0
Align to: MiB
Create as: Primary Partition
Partition name: 
File system: nfts
Label: Flash



After you've created the FAT32 and NTFS partitions, the USB drive partition information appears in the GParted console.



To make the USB drive bootable from the FAT32 partition, follow these steps.


Download the customized Ubuntu ISO image appropriate for your AWS DeepRacer model:

For AWS DeepRacer vehicles ordered from amazon.com with a white AWS logo on the chassis, download this customized Ubuntu ISO image (0.0.8 BIOS ) . 
For AWS DeepRacer vehicles originating from re:Invent 2018 with no text on the chassis, download this customized Ubuntu ISO image (0.0.6 BIOS ). 



Use UNetbootin on your AWS DeepRacer device, to do the following:


On your AWS DeepRacer compute module, run the following command to install and launch UNetbootin.
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install unetbootin
 sudo unetbootin


On the UNetbootin window, do the following:


Check the Disimage radio button.


For the disk image, choose ISO from the drop-down menu.


Open the file picker to choose the downloaded Ubuntu ISO file.


For Type, choose USB Drive.


For Drive, choose /dev/sda1.


Choose OK.

Note
The customized Ubuntu image may be more recent than what's shown here. If so, use the most recent version of the Ubuntu image.


If you get a /dev/sda1 not mounted alert message, choose OK to close the message, unplug the USB drive, replug the drive, and then follow the steps above create the Ubuntu ISO image. 




To copy the factory restore files to the NTFS partition of the USB drive, follow these steps.


Download the compressed factory restore package appropriate for your AWS DeepRacer model:

For AWS DeepRacer vehicles ordered from amazon.com with a white AWS logo on the chassis, download this compressed factory restore package (0.0.8 BIOS ) . 
For AWS DeepRacer vehicles originating from re:Invent 2018 with no text on the chassis, download this compressed factory restore package (0.0.6 BIOS ). 



Unzip the downloaded package, and copy the uncompressed files to the second (NTFS) partition of the USB drive.
