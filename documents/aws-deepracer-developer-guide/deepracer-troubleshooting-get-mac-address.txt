How to Get the MAC Address of Your AWS DeepRacer Device
Follow the instructions below to get the MAC address of your AWS DeepRacer device: 


Make sure that your AWS DeepRacer device is only connected to a Wi-Fi network. 


Connect your AWS DeepRacer device to a monitor. You'll need a HDMI-to-HDMI, HDMI-to-DVI or similar cable and insert one end of the cable into the HDMI port on the vehicle's chassis and plug the other end into a supported display port on the monitor. 


Connect a USB keyboard to your AWS DeepRacer using the USB port on the device's compute module, after the compute module is booted. 


Type deepracer in the Username input field. 


Type the device SSH password in the Password input field. 


If this is your first time to log in to the device, type deepracer in the Password input field. Reset the password, as required, before moving to the next step. You'll use the new password for future logins. For security reasons, use a complex or strong password phrase for the new password.


After logged in, open a Terminal window. 
You can use the Search button for the Terminal application. 


Type the following Ubuntu shell command in the Terminal window: 


ifconfig | grep HWaddr
The command produces an output similar to the following:

mlan0    Link encap:Ethernet   HWaddr   01:2a:34:b5:c6:de
The hexadecimal numbers are the device's MAC address\.
