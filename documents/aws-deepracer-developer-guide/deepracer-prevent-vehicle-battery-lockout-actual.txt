How to Prevent AWS DeepRacer Vehicle Battery Lockout
Learn how to prevent AWS DeepRacer vehicle battery lockout.
To preserve battery health, the AWS DeepRacer vehicle battery goes into lockout state. When this happens, the battery won't power your vehicle even if it's still partially charged. To prevent your car battery from entering lockout state, do the following:
 When you finish using your AWS DeepRacer, turn off the vehicle to preserve the battery's charge.
 When the device console alerts you that your vehicle battery's power level is low, charge it as soon as possible.
 When you think you won't use AWS DeepRacer for a while, disconnect the battery from the vehicle and fully charge it. We suggest you charge your vehicle battery at least once a year to protect it and prevent lockout.
Note
All lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries slowly discharge over time, even when not in use.
