# Manage an AWS DeepRacer Community Race<a name="deepracer-manage-community-races"></a>

All community races are private and aren't visible to a user unless the user has an invitation link\. Invitation links can be shared and forwarded to anyone\. To join the race, participants need an AWS account\. If this is their first time, users go through the account creation process before they can join the race\. 

As the race organizer, you can edit race details and remove participants as part of the race management\.
