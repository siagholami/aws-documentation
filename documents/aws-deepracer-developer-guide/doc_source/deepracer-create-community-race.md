# Organize an AWS DeepRacer Community Race<a name="deepracer-create-community-race"></a>

Community racing events are races organized by AWS DeepRacer users that are not officially sponsored by AWS\.

To organize a community race for AWS DeepRacer users to join, you must create a community race and invite participants to join by sharing a race invitation link\. You can do so in the AWS DeepRacer console\.

1. Open the [AWS DeepRacer console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/deepracer)\.

1. From the main navigation pane, choose **Community races**\.

1. Under the **Community races**, choose **Create race**\.

1. \(Optional\) Choose a racing image\.

   The recipients becomes invited participants when they follow the link to [join the race](deepracer-join-community-race.md#join-community-race-as-new-racer)\. A recipient can forward the link to invite another user to participate in the race\. Users without the invitation link aren't aware of the event and can't access the race\. However, the race organizer can deny any invited user to access the event by removing the participant from the race\. This is part of the community race management tasks\. The [next section](deepracer-manage-community-races.md) discusses these details\.
