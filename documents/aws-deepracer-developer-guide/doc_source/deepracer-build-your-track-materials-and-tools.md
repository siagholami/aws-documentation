## Materials You May Need<a name="deepracer-build-your-track-materials"></a>

To build a track, you need the following materials:
+ For track borders: 

  You can create a track with tape that is about 2\-inches wide and white or off\-white color against the dark\-colored track surface\. For a dark surface, use a white or off\-white tape\. For example, [1\.88 inch width, pearl white duct tape](https://www.amazon.com/Scotch-Pearl-White-1-88-Inch-20-Yard/dp/B003YHBU1O) or [1\.88 inch \(less sticky\) masking tape](https://www.amazon.com/Industrial-Masking-Multi-Use-1-88In-60Yard/dp/B07G9VFC4D)\.
+ For track surface: 

  You can create a track on a dark\-colored hard floor such as hardwood, carpet, concrete, or [asphalt felt](https://www.amazon.com/30-ASTM-D-226-DADE-CNTY/dp/B000FCIONS/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&qid=1549398905&sr=8-12&keywords=roofing+paper)\. The latter mimics the real\-world road surface with minimal reflection\. [Interlocked foam or rubber pads](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013A4ATCQ?ref_=ams_ad_dp_ttl&th=1) are also good options\.
