# Preparing for the Factory Reset of Your AWS DeepRacer Vehicle<a name="deepracer-vehicle-factory-reset-preparation"></a>

## <a name="Introduction"></a>

Resetting your AWS DeepRacer completely wipes the data on the device and returns it to its factory settings\. To prepare, there are steps you need to take that require additional hardware\. This topic explains what you need to get started and walks you through the process\.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before you get started make sure you have the following items ready:
+ 1 USB flash drive, 32 GB or larger
+ A computer to facilitate preparation \- Choose one of the following options: 
  + **Option 1:** Set up your AWS DeepRacer compute module as a Linux computer with a mouse, keyboard, monitor \(connect with HDMI type A cable\) 
  + **Option 2:** Connect AWS DeepRacer to an Ubuntu, MacOS, or Windows computer
+ An AWS DeepRacer vehicle 
**Important**  
Confirm which AWS DeepRacer hardware model you are resetting to insure you download the correct image and factory reset file
  + **A**: Vehicles ordered from amazon\.com have a white "AWS" logo on the chassis \- use **0\.0\.8 BIOS** path
  + **B**: Vehicles originating from re:Invent 2018 have no text on the chassis \- use **0\.0\.6 BIOS** path

## Preparation<a name="preparation"></a>

To prepare for the factory reset, perform the following tasks\.
+ Format the USB drive into the following two partitions\.
  + FAT32 of 2 GB
  + NTFS of at least 16 GB
+ Make the USB drive bootable to start the factory reset on reboot\.
  + Burn the required custom Ubuntu ISO image to the FAT32 partition\.
  + Copy the required factory restore files to the NTFS partition of the USB drive\.

Depending on the computer you use, specific tasks may differ from one operating system to another\. We present step\-by\-step instructions to prepare your USB drive using Ubuntu \(via the computer module of the AWS DeepRacer vehicle\), MacOS, and Windows operating systems\.

The instructions for using other Linux or Unix computers are similar to the Ubuntu instructions discussed in the following section\. You need to replace the `apt-get` commands with the corresponding commands supported by the other Linux or Unix system that you choose to use instead\. 

Choose one of the following procedures according to the type of computer you use\.

## Partition a USB Drive and Make it Bootable by Using an Ubuntu Computer<a name="deepracer-vehicle-factory-reset-preparation-ubuntu"></a>

 In the following steps, use the AWS DeepRacer vehicle computer module as an Ubuntu computer\. The same instructions apply to a Linux computer running Ubuntu\. The instructions on other flavors of Linux or Unix operating systems are similar\. Just replace the `apt-get *` commands with their corresponding commands supported by the other Linux or Unix system of your choosing\. 

**To partition the USB drive and make it bootable**

1. To format the USB drive by running Ubuntu commands on the AWS DeepRacer vehicle or a computer running Ubuntu, do the following\.

   1. On the AWS DeepRacer vehicle compute module, run the following commands to install and launch GParted\.

      ```
      sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install gparted
      sudo gparted
      ```  
![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/deepracer/latest/developerguide/images/open-gparted-console.png)

   1. On the newly created GParted console, choose **/dev/sda** in the drop\-down menu on the top\-right corner and then delete all existing partitions\.

      If the partitions are locked, open the context \(right\-click\) menu and choose **unmount**\.

   1. To create the FAT32 partition of 2 GB capacity, choose the file icon on the top\-left, set the parameters similar to the following, and then choose **Add**\. 

      **Free space preceding:** **1**

      **New size:****2048**

      **Free space following:** **27951**

      **Align to:** **MiB**

      **Create as:** **Primary Partition**

      **Partition name:**: 

      **File system:** **fat32**

      **Label:** **BOOT**  
![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/deepracer/latest/developerguide/images/create-fat32-partition-on-gparted-console.png)

   1. To create the NTFS partition of at least 16 GB capacity, choose the file icon again, set the parameters similar to the following, and choose **Add**\.

      **Free space preceding:** **0**

      **New size:****27951**

      **Free space following:** **0**

      **Align to:** **MiB**

      **Create as:** **Primary Partition**

      **Partition name:** 

      **File system:** **nfts**

      **Label:** **Flash**  
![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/deepracer/latest/developerguide/images/create-ntfs-partition-on-gparted-console.png)

   1. After you've created the FAT32 and NTFS partitions, the USB drive partition information appears in the GParted console\.  
![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/deepracer/latest/developerguide/images/apply-partitions-on-gparted-console.png)

1. To make the USB drive bootable from the FAT32 partition, follow these steps\.

   1. Download the customized Ubuntu ISO image appropriate for your AWS DeepRacer model:
      + For AWS DeepRacer vehicles ordered from amazon\.com with a white **AWS** logo on the chassis, download this [customized Ubuntu ISO image \(0\.0\.8 BIOS \) ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/deepracer-public/factory-restore/BIOS-0.0.8/Ubuntu-Live-16.04.3-dlrc_Recovery_tpm_V3.iso)\. 
      + For AWS DeepRacer vehicles originating from re:Invent 2018 with no text on the chassis, download this [customized Ubuntu ISO image \(0\.0\.6 BIOS \)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/deepracer-public/factory-restore/BIOS-0.0.6/Ubuntu-Live-16.04.3-dlrc_Recovery_tpm_V3.iso)\. 

   1. Use UNetbootin on your AWS DeepRacer device, to do the following:

      1. On your AWS DeepRacer compute module, run the following command to install and launch UNetbootin\.

         ```
         sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install unetbootin
         sudo unetbootin
         ```

      1. On the UNetbootin window, do the following:

         1. Check the **Disimage** radio button\.

         1. For the disk image, choose **ISO** from the drop\-down menu\.

         1. Open the file picker to choose the downloaded Ubuntu ISO file\.

         1. For **Type**, choose **USB Drive**\.

         1. For **Drive**, choose `/dev/sda1`\.

         1. Choose **OK**\.  
![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/deepracer/latest/developerguide/images/set-diskimage-iso-in-ubuntu.png)
**Note**  
The customized Ubuntu image may be more recent than what's shown here\. If so, use the most recent version of the Ubuntu image\.

         If you get a **/dev/sda1 not mounted** alert message, choose OK to close the message, unplug the USB drive, replug the drive, and then follow the steps above create the Ubuntu ISO image\. 

1. To copy the factory restore files to the NTFS partition of the USB drive, follow these steps\.

   1. Download the compressed factory restore package appropriate for your AWS DeepRacer model:
      + For AWS DeepRacer vehicles ordered from amazon\.com with a white **AWS** logo on the chassis, download this [compressed factory restore package \(0\.0\.8 BIOS \) ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/deepracer-public/factory-restore/BIOS-0.0.8/factory_reset.zip)\.
