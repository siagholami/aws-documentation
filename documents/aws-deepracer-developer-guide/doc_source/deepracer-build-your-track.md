# Build Your Physical Track for AWS DeepRacer<a name="deepracer-build-your-track"></a>

 This section describes how you can build a physical track for a AWS DeepRacer model\. To drive your AWS DeepRacer autonomously and to test your reinforcement learning model in a physical environment, you need a physical track\. Your track resembles the simulated track used in training and replicates the environment used to train the deployed AWS DeepRacer model\.
