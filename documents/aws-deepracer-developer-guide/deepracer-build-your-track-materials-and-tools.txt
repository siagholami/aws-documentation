Materials You May Need
To build a track, you need the following materials:
 For track borders: 
You can create a track with tape that is about 2-inches wide and white or off-white color against the dark-colored track surface. For a dark surface, use a white or off-white tape. For example, 1.88 inch width, pearl white duct tape or 1.88 inch (less sticky) masking tape.
 For track surface: 
You can create a track on a dark-colored hard floor such as hardwood, carpet, concrete, or asphalt felt. The latter mimics the real-world road surface with minimal reflection. Interlocked foam or rubber pads are also good options. 
Tools You May Need
The following tools are either required or helpful to design and build your track:
