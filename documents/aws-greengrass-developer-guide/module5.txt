Module 5: Interacting with device shadows
This advanced module shows you how AWS IoT Greengrass devices can interact with AWS IoT device shadows in an AWS IoT Greengrass group. A shadow is a JSON document that is used to store current or desired state information for a thing. In this module, you discover how one AWS IoT Greengrass device (GG_Switch) can modify the state of another AWS IoT Greengrass device (GG_TrafficLight) and how these states can be synced to the AWS IoT Greengrass cloud:

Before you begin, run the Greengrass device setup script, or make sure that you have completed Module 1 and Module 2. You should also understand how to connect devices to an AWS IoT Greengrass core (Module 4). You do not need other components or devices.
This module should take about 30 minutes to complete.
