**Note**  
We recommend that you [upgrade connector versions](connectors.md#upgrade-connector-versions) from Python 2\.7 to Python 3\.7\. Continued support for Python 2\.7 connectors depends on AWS Lambda runtime support\. For more information, see [Runtime support policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtime-support-policy.html) in the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*\.
