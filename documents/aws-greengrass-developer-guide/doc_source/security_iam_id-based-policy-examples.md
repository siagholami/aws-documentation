# Identity\-based policy examples for AWS IoT Greengrass<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-examples"></a>

By default, IAM users and roles don't have permission to create or modify AWS IoT Greengrass resources\. They also can't perform tasks using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS API\. An IAM administrator must create IAM policies that grant users and roles permission to perform specific API operations on the specified resources they need\. The administrator must then attach those policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions\.

## Policy best practices<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-policy-best-practices"></a>

Identity\-based policies are very powerful\. They determine whether someone can create, access, or delete AWS IoT Greengrass resources in your account\. These actions can incur costs for your AWS account\. When you create or edit identity\-based policies, follow these guidelines and recommendations:
+ **Get Started Using AWS Managed Policies** – To start using AWS IoT Greengrass quickly, use AWS managed policies to give your employees the permissions they need\. These policies are already available in your account and are maintained and updated by AWS\. For more information, see [Get Started Using Permissions With AWS Managed Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#bp-use-aws-defined-policies) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ **Grant Least Privilege** – When you create custom policies, grant only the permissions required to perform a task\. Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary\. Doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later\. For more information, see [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ **Enable MFA for Sensitive Operations** – For extra security, require IAM users to use multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) to access sensitive resources or API operations\. For more information, see [Using Multi\-Factor Authentication \(MFA\) in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ **Use Policy Conditions for Extra Security** – To the extent that it's practical, define the conditions under which your identity\-based policies allow access to a resource\. For example, you can write conditions to specify a range of allowable IP addresses that a request must come from\. You can also write conditions to allow requests only within a specified date or time range, or to require the use of SSL or MFA\. For more information, see [IAM JSON Policy Elements: Condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## AWS managed policies for AWS IoT Greengrass<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-gg-managed"></a>

AWS IoT Greengrass maintains the following AWS managed policies that you can use to grant permissions to IAM users and roles\.


| Policy | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| [AWSGreengrassFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FAWSGreengrassFullAccess) | Allows all AWS IoT Greengrass actions for all of your AWS resources\. This policy is recommended for AWS IoT Greengrass [service administrators](security-iam.md#security_iam_audience) or testing purposes\. | 
| [ AWSGreengrassReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FAWSGreengrassReadOnlyAccess) | Allows `List` and `Get` AWS IoT Greengrass actions for all of your AWS resources\. | 
| [ AWSGreengrassResourceAccessRolePolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2Fservice-role%2FAWSGreengrassResourceAccessRolePolicy) | Allows access to resources from AWS services including AWS Lambda and AWS IoT Device Shadow\. This is the default policy used for the [Greengrass service role](service-role.md)\. This policy is designed to provide general ease of access\. You can define a custom policy that is more restrictive\. | 
| [ GreengrassOTAUpdateArtifactAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2Fservice-role%2FGreengrassOTAUpdateArtifactAccess) | Allows read\-only access to over\-the\-air \(OTA\) update artifacts for the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software in all AWS Regions\. |

The following example customer\-defined policies grant permissions for common scenarios\.

To learn how to create an IAM identity\-based policy using these example JSON policy documents, see [Creating policies on the JSON tab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html#access_policies_create-json-editor) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

### Allow users to view their own permissions<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-view-own-permissions"></a>

This example shows how you might create a policy that allows IAM users to view the inline and managed policies that are attached to their user identity\. This policy includes permissions to complete this action on the console or programmatically using the AWS CLI or AWS API\.
