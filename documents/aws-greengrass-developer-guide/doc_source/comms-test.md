# Test communications<a name="comms-test"></a>

1. On your computer, open two [command\-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) windows\. Just as in [Module 5](module5.md), one window is for the GG\_Switch device and the other is for the GG\_TrafficLight device\. You use them to run the same commands that you ran in Module 5\.

   Run the following commands for the GG\_Switch device:

   ```
   cd path-to-certs-folder
   python lightController.py --endpoint AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT --rootCA root-ca-cert.pem --cert switch.cert.pem --key switch.private.key --thingName GG_TrafficLight --clientId GG_Switch
   ```

   Run the following commands for the GG\_TrafficLight device:

   ```
   cd path-to-certs-folder
   python trafficLight.py --endpoint AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT --rootCA root-ca-cert.pem --cert light.cert.pem --key light.private.key --thingName GG_TrafficLight --clientId GG_TrafficLight
   ```

   Every 20 seconds, the switch updates the shadow state to G, Y, and R, and the light displays its new state\.

1. The function handler of the Lambda function is triggered on every third green light \(every three minutes\), and a new DynamoDB record is created\. After `lightController.py` and `trafficLight.py` have run for three minutes, go to the AWS Management Console, and open the DynamoDB console\.

1. Choose **US East \(N\. Virginia\)** in the AWS Region menu\. This is the Region where the `GG_Car_Aggregator` function creates the table\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Tables**, and then choose the **CarStats** table\.   
![\[Screenshots of DynamoDB console with CarStats and Items tab highlighted.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-099.png)

   On the **Items** tab, you should see entries with basic statistics on cars passed \(one entry for every three minutes\)\. You might need to choose the refresh button to view updates to the table\.

1. If the test is not successful, you can look for troubleshooting information in the Greengrass logs\.

   1. <a name="root-access-logs"></a>Switch to the root user and navigate to the `log` directory\. Access to AWS IoT Greengrass logs requires root permissions\.

      ```
      sudo su
      cd /greengrass/ggc/var/log
      ```

   1. Check `runtime.log` for errors\.

      ```
      cat system/runtime.log | grep 'ERROR'
      ```

   1. Check the log generated by the Lambda function\.

      ```
      cat user/region/account-id/GG_Car_Aggregator.log
      ```

      <a name="check-connection-info"></a> The `lightController.py` and `trafficLight.py` scripts store connection information in the `groupCA` folder, which is created in the same folder as the scripts\. If you receive connection errors, make sure that the IP address in the `ggc-host` file matches the single IP address endpoint that you configured for your core in [this step](config-dev-subs.md#configure-ip-address)\.

   For more information, see [Troubleshooting AWS IoT Greengrass](gg-troubleshooting.md)\.

This is the end of the basic tutorial\. You should now understand the AWS IoT Greengrass programming model and its fundamental concepts, including AWS IoT Greengrass cores, groups, subscriptions, devices, and the deployment process for Lambda functions running at the edge\.

You can delete the DynamoDB table and the Greengrass Lambda functions and subscriptions\. To stop communications between the AWS IoT Greengrass core device and the AWS IoT cloud, open a terminal on the core device and run one of the following commands:
+ To shut down the AWS IoT Greengrass core device:

  ```
  sudo halt
  ```
+ To stop the AWS IoT Greengrass daemon:

  ```
  cd /greengrass/ggc/core/
  sudo ./greengrassd stop
  ```
