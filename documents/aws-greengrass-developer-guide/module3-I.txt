Module 3 (part 1): Lambda functions on AWS IoT Greengrass
This module shows you how to create and deploy a Lambda function that sends MQTT messages from your AWS IoT Greengrass core device. The module describes Lambda function configurations, subscriptions used to allow MQTT messaging, and deployments to a core device.
Module 3 (Part 2) covers the differences between on-demand and long-lived Lambda functions running on the AWS IoT Greengrass core.
Before you begin, make sure that you have completed Module 1 and Module 2 and have a running AWS IoT Greengrass core device.
Tip
Or, to use a script that sets up your core device for you, see Quick start: Greengrass device setup. The script can also create and deploy the Lambda function used in this module.
This module should take about 30 minutes to complete.
