Test communications (device syncs enabled)
For this test, you configure the GG_TrafficLight device shadow to sync to AWS IoT. You run the same commands as in the previous test, but this time the shadow state in the cloud is updated when GG_Switch sends an update request.


In the AWS IoT console, choose your AWS IoT Greengrass group, and then choose Devices.


For the GG_TrafficLight device, choose the ellipsis (â€¦), and then choose Sync to the Cloud.



You should receive a notification that the device shadow was updated.

On the group configuration page, from Actions, choose Deploy.


This deploys the group configuration to your AWS IoT Greengrass core device. For troubleshooting help, see Troubleshooting AWS IoT Greengrass.


In your two command-line windows, run the commands from the previous test for the GG_Switch and GG_TrafficLight devices.


Now, check the shadow state in the AWS IoT console. Choose your AWS IoT Greengrass group, choose Devices, choose GG_TrafficLight, and then choose Shadow.


Because you enabled sync of the GG_TrafficLight shadow to AWS IoT, the shadow state in the cloud should be updated whenever GG_Switch sends an update. This functionality can be used to expose the state of a Greengrass device to AWS IoT.


Note
If necessary, you can troubleshoot issues by viewing the AWS IoT Greengrass core logs, particularly runtime.log:  
cd /greengrass/ggc/var/log
   sudo cat system/runtime.log | more
 You can also view GGShadowSyncManager.log and GGShadowService.log. For more information, see Troubleshooting AWS IoT Greengrass. 
Keep the devices and subscriptions set up. You use them in the next module. You also run the same commands.
