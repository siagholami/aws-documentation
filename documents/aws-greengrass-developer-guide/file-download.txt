Download required files

If you haven't already done so, install the AWS IoT Device SDK for Python. For instructions, see step 1 in Install the AWS IoT Device SDK for Python.

This SDK is used by AWS IoT devices to communicate with AWS IoT and with AWS IoT Greengrass core devices.

From the  TrafficLight examples folder on GitHub, download the lightController.py and trafficLight.py files to your computer. Save them in the folder that contains the GG_Switch and GG_TrafficLight device certificates and keys.

The lightController.py script corresponds to the GG_Switch device, and the trafficLight.py script corresponds to the GG_TrafficLight device. 

Note
The example Python files are stored in the AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK for Python repository for convenience, but they don't use the AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK.
