Kinesis Firehose
The Kinesis Firehose connector publishes data through an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to destinations such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon Elasticsearch Service.
This connector is a data producer for a Kinesis delivery stream. It receives input data on an MQTT topic, and sends the data to a specified delivery stream. The delivery stream then sends the data record to the configured destination (for example, an S3 bucket).
This connector has the following versions.

Requirements
This connector has the following requirements:

[ Version 4 ]

AWS IoT Greengrass Core software v1.9.3 or later.
Python version 3.7 installed on the core device and added to the PATH environment variable.
A configured Kinesis delivery stream. For more information, see Creating an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream in the Amazon Kinesis Firehose Developer Guide.
The Greengrass group role configured to allow the firehose:PutRecord and firehose:PutRecordBatch actions on the target delivery stream, as shown in the following example IAM policy.

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement":[
          {
              "Sid":"Stmt1528133056761",
              "Action":[
                  "firehose:PutRecord",
                  "firehose:PutRecordBatch"
              ],
              "Effect":"Allow",
              "Resource":[
                  "arn:aws:firehose:region:account-id:deliverystream/stream-name"
              ]
          }
      ]
   }
This connector allows you to dynamically override the default delivery stream in the input message payload. If your implementation uses this feature, the IAM policy should include all target streams as resources. You can grant granular or conditional access to resources (for example, by using a wildcard * naming scheme).
For the group role requirement, you must configure the role to grant the required permissions and make sure the role has been added to the group. For more information, see Managing the Greengrass group role (console) or Managing the Greengrass group role (CLI).

Input data
This connector accepts stream content on MQTT topics, and then sends the content to the target delivery stream. It accepts two types of input data:
 JSON data on the kinesisfirehose/message topic.
 Binary data on the kinesisfirehose/message/binary/# topic.

[ Versions 2 - 4 ]
Topic filter: kinesisfirehose/message
Use this topic to send a message that contains JSON data.  
Message properties 
request
The data to send to the delivery stream and the target delivery stream, if different from the default stream.
Required: true
Type: object that includes the following properties:  
data
The data to send to the delivery stream.
Required: true
Type: bytes
delivery_stream_arn
The ARN of the target Kinesis delivery stream. Include this property to override the default delivery stream.
Required: false
Type: string
Valid pattern: arn:aws:firehose:([a-z]{2}-[a-z]-\d{1}):(\d{12}):deliverystream/([a-zA-Z0-9_\-.])$
id
An arbitrary ID for the request. This property is used to map an input request to an output response. When specified, the id property in the response object is set to this value. If you don't use this feature, you can omit this property or specify an empty string.
Required: false
Type: string
Valid pattern: .*
Example input 
{
     "request": {
        "delivery_stream_arn": "arn:aws:firehose:region:account-id:deliverystream/stream2-name",
        "data": "Data to send to the delivery stream."
     },
     "id": "request123"
}
 
Topic filter: kinesisfirehose/message/binary/#
Use this topic to send a message that contains binary data. The connector doesn't parse binary data. The data is streamed as is.
To map the input request to an output response, replace the # wildcard in the message topic with an arbitrary request ID. For example, if you publish a message to kinesisfirehose/message/binary/request123, the id property in the response object is set to request123.
If you don't want to map a request to a response, you can publish your messages to kinesisfirehose/message/binary/. Be sure to include the trailing slash.

[ Version 1 ]
Topic filter: kinesisfirehose/message
Use this topic to send a message that contains JSON data.  
Message properties 
request
The data to send to the delivery stream and the target delivery stream, if different from the default stream.
Required: true
Type: object that includes the following properties:  
data
The data to send to the delivery stream.

Required: false
Type: string
Valid pattern: .*
Example input 
{
     "request": {
        "delivery_stream_arn": "arn:aws:firehose:region:account-id:deliverystream/stream2-name",
        "data": "Data to send to the delivery stream."
     },
     "id": "request123"
}
 
Topic filter: kinesisfirehose/message/binary/#
Use this topic to send a message that contains binary data. The connector doesn't parse binary data. The data is streamed as is.
To map the input request to an output response, replace the # wildcard in the message topic with an arbitrary request ID. For example, if you publish a message to kinesisfirehose/message/binary/request123, the id property in the response object is set to request123.
If you don't want to map a request to a response, you can publish your messages to kinesisfirehose/message/binary/. Be sure to include the trailing slash.

Output data
This connector publishes status information as output data on an MQTT topic.

[ Versions 2 - 4 ]
Topic filter in subscription 
kinesisfirehose/message/status
Example output
The response contains the status of each data record sent in the batch.  
{
    "response": [
        {
            "ErrorCode": "error",
            "ErrorMessage": "test error",
            "id": "request123",
            "status": "fail"
        },
        {
            "firehose_record_id": "xyz2",
            "id": "request456",
            "status": "success"
        },
        {
            "firehose_record_id": "xyz3",
            "id": "request890",
            "status": "success"
        }
    ]
}
If the connector detects a retryable error (for example, connection errors), it retries the publish in the next batch. Exponential backoff is handled by the AWS SDK. Requests that fail with retryable errors are added back to the end of the queue for further publishing.

[ Version 1 ]
Topic filter in subscription 
kinesisfirehose/message/status
Example output: Success 
{
   "response": {
       "firehose_record_id": "1lxfuuuFomkpJYzt/34ZU/r8JYPf8Wyf7AXqlXm",
       "status": "success"
    },
    "id": "request123"
}
Example output: Failure 
{
   "response" : {
       "error": "ResourceNotFoundException",
       "error_message": "An error occurred (ResourceNotFoundException) when calling the PutRecord operation: Firehose test1 not found under account 123456789012.",
       "status": "fail"
   },
   "id": "request123"
}

Usage Example
Use the following high-level steps to set up an example Python 3.7 Lambda function that you can use to try out the connector.
Note 
The Get started with connectors (console) and Get started with connectors (CLI) topics contain detailed steps that show you how to configure and deploy an example Twilio Notifications connector.

Make sure you meet the requirements for the connector.

For the group role requirement, you must configure the role to grant the required permissions and make sure the role has been added to the group. For more information, see Managing the Greengrass group role (console) or Managing the Greengrass group role (CLI).

Create and publish a Lambda function that sends input data to the connector.

Save the example code as a PY file. Download and unzip the AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK for Python. Then, create a zip package that contains the PY file and the greengrasssdk folder at the root level. This zip package is the deployment package that you upload to AWS Lambda.
After you create the Python 3.7 Lambda function, publish a function version and create an alias.


Configure your Greengrass group.


Add the Lambda function by its alias (recommended). Configure the Lambda lifecycle as long-lived (or "Pinned": true in the CLI).


Add the connector and configure its parameters.


Add subscriptions that allow the connector to receive JSON input data and send output data on supported topic filters.

Set the Lambda function as the source, the connector as the target, and use a supported input topic filter.
Set the connector as the source, AWS IoT Core as the target, and use a supported output topic filter. You use this subscription to view status messages in the AWS IoT console.



Deploy the group.


In the AWS IoT console, on the Test page, subscribe to the output data topic to view status messages from the connector. The example Lambda function is long-lived and starts sending messages immediately after the group is deployed.


When you're finished testing, you can set the Lambda lifecycle to on-demand (or "Pinned": false in the CLI) and deploy the group. This stops the function from sending messages.
Example
The following example Lambda function sends an input message to the connector. This message contains JSON data.
```
import greengrasssdk
import time
import json
iot_client = greengrasssdk.client('iot-data')
send_topic = 'kinesisfirehose/message'
def create_request_with_all_fields():
    return  {
        "request": {
            "data": "Message from Firehose Connector Test"
        },
        "id" : "req_123"
    }
def publish_basic_message():
    messageToPublish = create_request_with_all_fields()
    print("Message To Publish: ", messageToPublish)
    iot_client.publish(topic=send_topic,
        payload=json.dumps(messageToPublish))
publish_basic_message()
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return
```
