Splunk Integration connector
The Splunk Integration connector publishes data from Greengrass devices to Splunk. This allows you to use Splunk to monitor and analyze the Greengrass core environment, and act on local events. The connector integrates with HTTP Event Collector (HEC). For more information, see Introduction to Splunk HTTP Event Collector in the Splunk documentation.
This connector receives logging and event data on an MQTT topic and publishes the data as is to the Splunk API.
You can use this connector to support industrial scenarios, such as:
 Operators can use periodic data from actuators and sensors (for example, temperature, pressure, and water readings) to trigger alarms when values exceed certain thresholds.
 Developers use data collected from industrial machinery to build ML models that can monitor the equipment for potential issues.
This connector has the following versions.

            }
        }
    ]
}'
Note
The Lambda function in this connector has a long-lived lifecycle.
In the AWS IoT Greengrass console, you can add a connector from the group's Connectors page. For more information, see Getting started with Greengrass connectors (console).
Input data
This connector accepts logging and event data on an MQTT topic and publishes the received data as is to the Splunk API. Input messages must be in JSON format.
Topic filter in subscription
splunk/logs/put
Message properties 
request
The event data to send to the Splunk API. Events must meet the specifications of the services/collector API.
Required: true
Type: object. Only the event property is required.
id
An arbitrary ID for the request. This property is used to map an input request to an output status.
Required: false
Type: string
Limits
All limits that are imposed by the Splunk API apply when using this connector. For more information, see services/collector.
Example input 
{
    "request": {
        "event": "some event",
        "fields": {
            "severity": "INFO",
            "category": [
                "value1",
                "value2"
            ]
        }
    },
    "id": "request123"
}
Output data
This connector publishes output data on two topics:
 Status information on the splunk/logs/put/status topic.
 Errors on the splunk/logs/put/error topic.
Topic filter: splunk/logs/put/status
Use this topic to listen for the status of the requests. Each time that the connector sends a batch of received data to the Splunk API, it publishes a list of the IDs of the requests that succeeded and failed.  
Example output 
{
    "response": {
        "succeeded": [
            "request123",
            ...
        ],
        "failed": [
            "request789",
            ...
        ]
    }
}
Topic filter: splunk/logs/put/error
Use this topic to listen for errors from the connector. The error_message property that describes the error or timeout encountered while processing the request.  
Example output 
{
    "response": {
        "error": "UnauthorizedException",
        "error_message": "invalid splunk token",
        "status": "fail"
    }
}
If the connector detects a retryable error (for example, connection errors), it retries the publish in the next batch.
Usage Example
Use the following high-level steps to set up an example Python 3.7 Lambda function that you can use to try out the connector.
Note 
The Get started with connectors (console) and Get started with connectors (CLI) topics contain detailed steps that show you how to configure and deploy an example Twilio Notifications connector.


Make sure you meet the requirements for the connector.


Create and publish a Lambda function that sends input data to the connector.


Save the example code as a PY file. Download and unzip the AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK for Python. Then, create a zip package that contains the PY file and the greengrasssdk folder at the root level. This zip package is the deployment package that you upload to AWS Lambda.
After you create the Python 3.7 Lambda function, publish a function version and create an alias.


Configure your Greengrass group.


Add the Lambda function by its alias (recommended). Configure the Lambda lifecycle as long-lived (or "Pinned": true in the CLI).


Add the required secret resource and grant read access to the Lambda function.


Add the connector and configure its parameters.


Add subscriptions that allow the connector to receive input data and send output data on supported topic filters.

Set the Lambda function as the source, the connector as the target, and use a supported input topic filter.
Set the connector as the source, AWS IoT Core as the target, and use a supported output topic filter. You use this subscription to view status messages in the AWS IoT console.



Deploy the group.


In the AWS IoT console, on the Test page, subscribe to the output data topic to view status messages from the connector. The example Lambda function is long-lived and starts sending messages immediately after the group is deployed.


When you're finished testing, you can set the Lambda lifecycle to on-demand (or "Pinned": false in the CLI) and deploy the group. This stops the function from sending messages.
Example
The following example Lambda function sends an input message to the connector.
```
import greengrasssdk
import time
import json
iot_client = greengrasssdk.client('iot-data')
send_topic = 'splunk/logs/put'
def create_request_with_all_fields():
    return {
        "request": {
            "event": "Access log test message."
        },
        "id" : "req_123"
    }
def publish_basic_message():
    messageToPublish = create_request_with_all_fields()
    print("Message To Publish: ", messageToPublish)
    iot_client.publish(topic=send_topic,
        payload=json.dumps(messageToPublish))
publish_basic_message()
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return
```
