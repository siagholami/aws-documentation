Verify the Lambda function is running on the core device


From the navigation pane of the AWS IoT console, choose Test.



Choose Subscribe to topic, and configure the following fields:
    For Subscription topic, enter hello/world. (Don't choose Subscribe to topic yet.)
    For Quality of Service, choose 0.
    For MQTT payload display, choose Display payloads as strings.




Choose Subscribe to topic.

Assuming the Lambda function is running on your device, it publishes messages similar to the following to the hello/world topic:

Although the Lambda function continues to send MQTT messages to the hello/world topic, don't stop the AWS IoT Greengrass daemon. The remaining modules are written with the assumption that it's running.
You can delete the function and subscription from the group:
 From the Lambdas page, choose the ellipsis (…), and then choose Remove function.
 From the Subscriptions page, choose the ellipsis (…), and then choose Delete.
The function and subscription are removed from the core during the next group deployment.
