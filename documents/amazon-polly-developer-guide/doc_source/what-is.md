# What Is Amazon Polly?<a name="what-is"></a>

Amazon Polly is a cloud service that converts text into lifelike speech\. You can use Amazon Polly to develop applications that increase engagement and accessibility\. Amazon Polly supports multiple languages and includes a variety of lifelike voices, so you can build speech\-enabled applications that work in multiple locations and use the ideal voice for your customers\. With Amazon Polly, you only pay for the text you synthesize\. You can also cache and replay Amazon Polly’s generated speech at no additional cost\. 

Common use cases for Amazon Polly include, but are not limited to, mobile applications such as newsreaders, games, eLearning platforms, accessibility applications for visually impaired people, and the rapidly growing segment of Internet of Things \(IoT\)\.

Amazon Polly is not certified for use with regulated workloads such as  Payment Card Industry \(PCI\) Data Security Standard \(DSS\), HIPAA  \(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996\), or FedRAMP\.

Some of the benefits of using Amazon Polly include:

+ **High quality** – Amazon Polly uses best\-in\-class Text\-to\-Speech \(TTS\) technology to synthesize natural speech with high pronunciation accuracy \(including abbreviations, acronym expansions, date/time interpretations, and homograph disambiguation\)\.

   

+ **Low latency** – Amazon Polly ensures fast response times, which make it a viable option for low\-latency use cases such as dialog systems\.

   

+ **Support for a large portfolio of languages and voices** – Amazon Polly supports dozens of voices and multiple languages, offering male and female voice options for most languages\.

   

+ **Cost\-effective** – Amazon Polly's pay\-per\-use model means there are no setup costs\. You can start small and scale up as your application grows\. 

   

+ **Cloud\-based solution** – On\-device Text\-to\-Speech solutions require significant computing resources, notably CPU power, RAM, and disk space\. These can result in higher development costs and higher power consumption on devices such as tablets, smart phones, etc\. In contrast, Text\-to\-Speech conversion done in the cloud dramatically reduces local resource requirements\. This enables support of all the available languages and voices at the best possible quality\. Moreover, speech improvements are instantly available to all end\-users and do not require additional updates for devices\.
