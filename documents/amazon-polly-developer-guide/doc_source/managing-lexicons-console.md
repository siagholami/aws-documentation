# Managing Lexicons Using the Amazon Polly Console<a name="managing-lexicons-console"></a>

You can use the Amazon Polly console to upload, download, apply, filter, and delete lexicons\. The following procedures demonstrate each of these processes\. 

## Uploading Lexicons Using the Console<a name="managing-lexicons-console-upload"></a>

To use a pronunciation lexicon, you must first upload it\. There are two locations on the console from which you can upload a lexicon, the **Text\-to\-Speech** tab and the **Lexicons** tab\.

The following processes describe how to add lexicons that you can use to customize how words and phrases uncommon to the chosen language are pronounced\. 

**To add a lexicon from the Lexicons Tab**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Polly console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/polly/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/polly/)\.

1. Choose the **Lexicons** tab\.

1. Choose **Upload**\.

1. Browse to find the lexicon that you want to upload\. You can use only PLS files that use the \.pls and \.xml extensions\.

1. Choose **Open**\. If a lexicon by the same name \(whether a \.pls or \.xml file\) already exists, uploading the lexicon will overwrite the existing lexicon\.

**To add a lexicon from the Text\-to\-Speech Tab**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Polly console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/polly/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/polly/)\.

1. Choose the **Text\-to\-Speech** tab\.

1. Choose **Customize pronunciation of words or phrases using lexicons**, then choose **Upload lexicon**\.

1. Browse to find the lexicon that you want to upload\. You can use only PLS files that use the \.pls and \.xml extensions\.

1. Choose **Open**\. If a lexicon with the same name \(whether a \.pls or \.xml file\) already exists, uploading the lexicon will overwrite the existing lexicon\.

## Applying Lexicons Using the Console \(Synthesize Speech\)<a name="managing-lexicons-console-synthesize-speech"></a>

The following procedure demonstrates how to apply a lexicon to your input text by applying the `W3c.pls` lexicon to substitute "World Wide Web Consortium" for "W3C"\. If you apply multiple lexicons to your text they are applied in a top\-down order with the first match taking precedence over later matches\. A lexicon is applied to the text only if the language specified in the lexicon is the same as the language chosen\.

You can apply a lexicon to plain text or SSML input\.

**Example â€“ Applying the W3C\.pls Lexicon**  
To create the lexicon you'll need for this exercise, see [Using the PutLexicon Operation](gs-put-lexicon.md)\. Use a plain text editor to create the W3C\.pls lexicon shown at the top of the topic\. Remember where you save this file\.  

**To apply the W3C\.pls lexicon to your input**

In this example we introduce a lexicon to substitute "World Wide Web Consortium" for "W3C"\. Compare the results of this exercise with that of [Using SSML with the Amazon Polly Console](ssml-to-speech-console.md) for both US English and another language\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Polly console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/polly/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/polly/)\.

1. Do one of the following:

   + Choose the **Plain text** tab and then type or paste this text into the text input box\.

     ```
     He was caught up in the game. 
     In the middle of the 10/3/2014 W3C meeting 
     he shouted, "Score!" quite loudly.
     ```

   + Choose the **SSML** tab and then type or paste this text into the text input box\.

     ```
     <speak>He wasn't paying attention.<break time="1s"/>
     In the middle of the 10/3/2014 W3C meeting 
     he shouted, "Score!" quite loudly.</speak>
     ```

1. From the **Choose a language and region** list, choose English US, then choose a voice you want to use for this text\.

1. Choose **Customize pronunciation of words or phrases using lexicons**\.

1. From the list of lexicons, choose `W3C (English, US)`\.

   If the `W3C (English, US)` lexicon is not listed, choose **Upload lexicon** and upload it, then choose it from the list\. To create this lexicon, see [Using the PutLexicon Operation](gs-put-lexicon.md)\.

1. To listen to the speech immediately, choose **Listen to speech**\.

1. To save the speech to a file,

   1. Choose **Save speech to MP3**\.

   1. To change to a different file format, choose **Change file format**, choose the file format you want, and then choose **Change**\.
Repeat the previous steps, but choose a different language and notice the difference in the output\.

## Filtering the Lexicon List Using the Console<a name="managing-lexicons-console-filter"></a>

The following procedure describes how to filter the lexicons list so that only lexicons of a chosen language are displayed\.

**To filter the lexicons listed by language**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Polly console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/polly/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/polly/)\.

1. Choose the **Lexicons** tab\.

1. Choose **Filter**\.

1. From the list of languages, choose the language you want to filter on\.

   The list displays only the lexicons for the chosen language\.

## Downloading Lexicons Using the Console<a name="managing-lexicons-console-download"></a>

The following process describes how to download one or more lexicons\. You can add, remove, or modify lexicon entries in the file and then upload it again to keep your lexicon up\-to\-date\. 

**To download one or more lexicons**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Polly console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/polly/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/polly/)\.

1. Choose the **Lexicons** tab\.

1. Choose the lexicon or lexicons you want to download\.

   1. To download a single lexicon, choose its name from the list\.

1. Choose **Download**\.

1. Open the folder where you want to download the lexicon\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

## Deleting a Lexicon Using the Console<a name="managing-lexicons-console-delete"></a>

**To delete a lexicon**

The following process describes how to delete a lexicon\. After deleting the lexicon, you must add it back before you can use it again\. You can delete one or more lexicons at the same time by selecting the check boxes next to individual lexicons\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Polly console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/polly/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/polly/)\.

1. Choose the **Lexicons** tab\.
