WordPress Plugin for Amazon Polly
The Amazon Polly plugin for WordPress lets visitors to your WordPress website listen to content in your chosen language and voice. You use the plugin to create an audio file of your written content, which your users can stream at their convenience. Website visitors can consume your content using new channels, such as inline audio players and mobile applications. .
You use the native WordPress Add Plugins page to install and configure the plugin. After you install and activate the plugin, you navigate to the Amazon Polly Settings page and connect the plugin to your AWS account. You can configure the plugin to automatically create audio files for new content upon publication, or choose the content individually. Archived content can be batch processed to provide your consumers with an enhanced experience as well. You can also use the Amazon Pollycast RSS feed to podcast the new audio content.
