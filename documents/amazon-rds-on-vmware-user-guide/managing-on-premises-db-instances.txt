Managing Your On-Premises DB Instances
In general, you manage on-premises DB instances for Amazon RDS on VMware in the same way that you manage Amazon RDS DB instances in a cloud environment. For information about managing DB instances, see the Amazon RDS User Guide. 
Note
Some management tasks that apply to Amazon RDS DB instances in a cloud environment don't apply to Amazon RDS on VMware DB instances. For example, with Amazon RDS on VMware, you manage storage locally on your vSphere cluster. Also, some restrictions apply to Amazon RDS on VMware DB instances. For information about the Amazon RDS features that are supported by Amazon RDS on VMware, see Support for RDS Features in Amazon RDS on VMware.
Because many RDS on VMware operations are dependent on a stable internet connection to AWS, some Amazon RDS operations are unavailable when the status of the custom AZ is Disconnected. For more information about restoring connectivity with a custom AZ, see Custom AZ Is Disconnected.
