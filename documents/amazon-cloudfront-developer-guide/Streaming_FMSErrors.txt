Note
Adobe designated Flash as end-of-life at the end of 2020. As a result, Amazon CloudFront will no longer support Adobe Flash Media Server and will be deprecating Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) distributions by December 31, 2020. For more information, read the full announcement on the Amazon CloudFront discussion forum.
