Supported protocols and ciphers between viewers and CloudFront
When you require HTTPS between viewers and your CloudFront distribution, you must choose a security policy, which determines the following settings.
 The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront uses to communicate with viewers.
 The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the communication with viewers.
To choose a security policy, specify the applicable value for Security Policy. The following table lists the protocols and ciphers that CloudFront can use for each security policy. 
A viewer must support at least one of the supported ciphers to establish an HTTPS connection with CloudFront. If you’re using an SSL/TLS certificate in AWS Certificate Manager, a viewer must support one of the *-RSA-* ciphers. CloudFront chooses a cipher in the listed order from among the ciphers that the viewer supports. See also OpenSSL, s2n, and RFC cipher names.

¹CloudFront supports one round trip time (1-RTT) handshakes for TLSv1.3, but does not support zero round trip time (0-RTT) handshakes.
OpenSSL, s2n, and RFC cipher names
OpenSSL and s2n use different names for ciphers than the TLS standards use (RFC 2246, RFC 4346, RFC 5246, and RFC 8446). The following table maps the OpenSSL and s2n names to the RFC name for each cipher.
For all elliptic curve ciphers, CloudFront supports the following elliptic curves:
 prime256v1
 secp384r1
 X25519
