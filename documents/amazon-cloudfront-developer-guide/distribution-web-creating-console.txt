Creating a Distribution
You can create or update a distribution by using the CloudFront console or programmatically. This topic is about working with distributions by using the console.
If you want to create or update a distribution by using the CloudFront API, see  Create Distribution or Update Distribution in the Amazon CloudFront API Reference. 
Important
When you update your distribution, be aware that a number of additional fields are required that are not required to create a distribution. To help make sure that all of the required fields are included when you update your distribution by using the CloudFront API, follow the steps described in the Amazon CloudFront API Reference.
To see the current maximum number of distributions that you can create for each AWS account, or to request a higher quota (formerly known as limit), see General Quotas on Web Distributions.
To create a CloudFront web distribution (console)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/.


Choose Create Distribution.


On the first page of the Create Distribution Wizard, in the Web section, choose Get Started.


Specify settings for the distribution. For more information, see Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution.


Save changes.


After CloudFront creates your distribution, the value of the Status column for your distribution will change from InProgress to Deployed. If you chose to enable the distribution, it will be ready to process requests after the status switches to Deployed. 


The domain name that CloudFront assigns to your distribution appears in the list of distributions. (It also appears on the General tab for a selected distribution.) 
Tip
You can use an alternate domain name, instead of the name assigned to you by CloudFront; by following the steps in Using Custom URLs for Files by Adding Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs).

When your distribution is deployed, confirm that you can access your content using your new CloudFront URL or CNAME. For more information, see Testing a Distribution.

To update a distribution (for example, to add or change cache behaviors), see Updating a Distribution.
