Supported protocols and ciphers between CloudFront and the origin
If you choose to require HTTPS between CloudFront and your origin, you can decide which SSL/TLS protocol to allow for the secure connection, and then pick any supported cipher for CloudFront (see the following tables) to establish an HTTPS connection to your origin.
CloudFront can forward HTTPS requests to the origin server by using the ECDSA or RSA ciphers listed in the following tables. Your origin server must support at least one of these ciphers for CloudFront to establish an HTTPS connection to your origin. To learn more about the two types of ciphers that CloudFront supports, see  About RSA and ECDSA Ciphers.
OpenSSL and s2n use different names for ciphers than the TLS standards use (RFC 2246, RFC 4346, RFC 5246, and RFC 8446). The following tables map the OpenSSL and s2n names to the RFC name for each cipher.
Supported RSA ciphers
CloudFront supports the following RSA ciphers for connections with an origin.
For all elliptic curve ciphers, CloudFront supports the following elliptic curves:
 prime256v1
 secp384r1
