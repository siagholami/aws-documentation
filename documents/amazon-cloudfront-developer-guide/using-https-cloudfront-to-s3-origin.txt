Requiring HTTPS for Communication Between CloudFront and Your Amazon S3 Origin
When your origin is an Amazon S3 bucket, your options for using HTTPS for communications with CloudFront depend on how you're using the bucket. If your Amazon S3 bucket is configured as a website endpoint, you can't configure CloudFront to use HTTPS to communicate with your origin because Amazon S3 doesn't support HTTPS connections in that configuration.
When your origin is an Amazon S3 bucket that supports HTTPS communication, CloudFront always forwards requests to S3 by using the protocol that viewers used to submit the requests. The default setting for the Origin Protocol Policy setting is Match Viewer and can't be changed. 
If you want to require HTTPS for communication between CloudFront and Amazon S3, you must change the value of Viewer Protocol Policy to Redirect HTTP to HTTPS or HTTPS Only. The procedure later in this section explains how to use the CloudFront console to change Viewer Protocol Policy. For information about using the CloudFront API to update the ViewerProtocolPolicy element for a web distribution, see UpdateDistribution in the Amazon CloudFront API Reference. 
When you use HTTPS with an Amazon S3 bucket that supports HTTPS communication, Amazon S3 provides the SSL/TLS certificate, so you don't have to.
To configure CloudFront to require HTTPS to your Amazon S3 origin


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/.


In the top pane of the CloudFront console, choose the ID for the distribution that you want to update.


On the Behaviors tab, choose the cache behavior that you want to update, and then choose Edit.


Specify one of the following values for Viewer Protocol Policy:
Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
Viewers can use both protocols, but HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS requests. CloudFront returns HTTP status code 301 (Moved Permanently) along with the new HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request to CloudFront using the HTTPS URL.
CloudFront doesn't redirect DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, or PUT requests from HTTP to HTTPS. If you configure a cache behavior to redirect to HTTPS, CloudFront responds to HTTP DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, or PUT requests for that cache behavior with HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden).
When a viewer makes an HTTP request that is redirected to an HTTPS request, CloudFront charges for both requests. For the HTTP request, the charge is only for the request and for the headers that CloudFront returns to the viewer. For the HTTPS request, the charge is for the request, and for the headers and the object returned by your origin.
HTTPS Only
Viewers can access your content only if they're using HTTPS. If a viewer sends an HTTP request instead of an HTTPS request, CloudFront returns HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden) and does not return the object.


Choose Yes, Edit.


Repeat steps 3 through 5 for each additional cache behavior that you want to require HTTPS for between viewers and CloudFront, and between CloudFront and S3.


Confirm the following before you use the updated configuration in a production environment:
    The path pattern in each cache behavior applies only to the requests that you want viewers to use HTTPS for.
    The cache behaviors are listed in the order that you want CloudFront to evaluate them in. For more information, see Path Pattern.
    The cache behaviors are routing requests to the correct origins.
