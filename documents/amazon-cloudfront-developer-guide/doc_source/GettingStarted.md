# Getting started with Amazon CloudFront<a name="GettingStarted"></a>

Get started with the basic steps to deliver your content with CloudFront by creating a simple CloudFront distribution or by using the AWS for WordPress plugin\. If you already have a WordPress website, we recommend using the AWS for WordPress plugin to create a CloudFront distribution\. If you aren't using WordPress, get started with a simple CloudFront distribution\.

With both of the following options, you can get started for free using the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)\. When your 12\-month free usage term expires or your use exceeds the tiers, you pay standard pay\-as\-you\-go rates for the services that you use\.
