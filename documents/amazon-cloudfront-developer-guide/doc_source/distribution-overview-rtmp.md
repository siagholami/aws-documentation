**Note**  
[Adobe designated Flash as end\-of\-life at the end of 2020](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/07/25/adobe-flash-update.html)\. As a result, Amazon CloudFront will no longer support Adobe Flash Media Server and will be deprecating Real\-Time Messaging Protocol \(RTMP\) distributions by December 31, 2020\. For more information, [read the full announcement on the Amazon CloudFront discussion forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=7356)\.

RTMP distributions stream media files using Adobe Media Server and the Adobe Real\-Time Messaging Protocol \(RTMP\)\. An RTMP distribution must use an Amazon S3 bucket as the origin\. 

For information about the values you specify when you create an RTMP distribution, see [Working with RTMP Distributions](distribution-rtmp.md)\. For information about creating an RTMP distribution, see [Task List for Streaming Media Files Using RTMP](distribution-rtmp-creating.md)\.
