# Using Lambda@Edge Functions with Origin Failover<a name="lambda-and-origin-failover"></a>

You can use Lambda@Edge functions with CloudFront distributions that youâ€™ve set up with origin groups, for example, for origin failover that you configure to help ensure high availability\. To use a Lambda function with an origin group, specify the function in an origin request or origin response trigger for an origin group when you create the cache behavior\.
