HTTP 503 Status Code (Lambda Limit Exceeded)
If youâ€™re using Lambda@Edge, an HTTP 503 status code can indicate that the Lambda service returned an error. The error might be caused by one of the following:
 The number of function executions exceeded one of the quotas (formerly known as limits) that Lambda sets to throttle executions in an AWS Region (concurrent executions or invocation frequency).
 The function exceeded the Lambda function timeout quota.
For more information about the AWS Lambda quotas, see AWS Lambda Limits in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. For more information about troubleshooting Lambda@Edge errors, see Testing and Debugging Lambda@Edge Functions.
