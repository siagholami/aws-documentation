Getting started with Amazon CloudFront
Get started with the basic steps to deliver your content with CloudFront by creating a simple CloudFront distribution or by using the AWS for WordPress plugin. If you already have a WordPress website, we recommend using the AWS for WordPress plugin to create a CloudFront distribution. If you aren't using WordPress, get started with a simple CloudFront distribution.
With both of the following options, you can get started for free using the AWS Free Tier. When your 12-month free usage term expires or your use exceeds the tiers, you pay standard pay-as-you-go rates for the services that you use.
