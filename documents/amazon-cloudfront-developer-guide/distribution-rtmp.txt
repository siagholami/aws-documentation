Working with RTMP Distributions
Note
Adobe designated Flash as end-of-life at the end of 2020. As a result, Amazon CloudFront will no longer support Adobe Flash Media Server and will be deprecating Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) distributions by December 31, 2020. For more information, read the full announcement on the Amazon CloudFront discussion forum.
This section describes how you configure and manage RTMP distributions. RTMP distributions stream media files using Adobe Media Server and the Adobe Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). For information about how to create an RTMP distribution, see Task List for Streaming Media Files Using RTMP.
