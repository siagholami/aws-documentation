Using Lambda@Edge Functions with Origin Failover
You can use Lambda@Edge functions with CloudFront distributions that youâ€™ve set up with origin groups, for example, for origin failover that you configure to help ensure high availability. To use a Lambda function with an origin group, specify the function in an origin request or origin response trigger for an origin group when you create the cache behavior.
