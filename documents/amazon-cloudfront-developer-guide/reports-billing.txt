AWS Usage Report for CloudFront
AWS provides a CloudFront usage report that is more detailed than the billing report but less detailed than CloudFront access logs.

The CloudFront usage report includes the following values:
 Service — AmazonCloudFront
 Operation — HTTP method. Values include DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, and PUT.
 UsageType — One of the following values
   A code that identifies the type of data transfer
   Invalidations
   SSL-Cert-Custom
For more information, see Interpreting Your AWS Bill and the AWS Usage Report for CloudFront.
 Resource — Either the ID of the CloudFront distribution associated with the usage or the certificate ID of an SSL certificate that you have associated with a CloudFront distribution.
 StartTime/EndTime — The day that the usage applies to, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 
 UsageValue — (1) The number of requests during the specified time period or (2) the amount of data transferred in bytes.
If you're using Amazon S3 as the origin for CloudFront, consider running the usage report for Amazon S3, too. However, if you use Amazon S3 for purposes other than as an origin for your CloudFront distributions, it might not be clear what portion applies to your CloudFront usage.
Tip
For detailed information about every request that CloudFront receives for your objects, turn on CloudFront access logs for your distribution. For more information, see Configuring and Using Standard Logs (Access Logs).
