Restricting Access Using Crossdomain.xml
Note
Adobe designated Flash as end-of-life at the end of 2020. As a result, Amazon CloudFront will no longer support Adobe Flash Media Server and will be deprecating Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) distributions by December 31, 2020. For more information, read the full announcement on the Amazon CloudFront discussion forum.
The Adobe Flash Media Server crossdomain.xml file specifies which domains can access media files in a particular domain. CloudFront supplies a default file that allows all domains to access the media files in your RTMP distribution, and you cannot change this behavior. If you include a more restrictive crossdomain.xml file in your Amazon S3 bucket, CloudFront ignores it.
