Quotas on Lambda@Edge
The quotas in this section apply to Lambda@Edge. These quotas are in addition to the default CloudFront and Lambda quotas, which also apply. For the default quotas, see Quotas in this guide and Quotas in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide.
Note
Lambda dynamically scales capacity in response to increased traffic, within your account’s quotas. For more information, see Function Scaling in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide.
In addition, be aware that there are some other restrictions when using Lambda@Edge functions. For more information, see Requirements and Restrictions on Lambda Functions.

Size Quotas on URI and Query String
When accessing or updating a URI or query string in a Lambda@Edge function, the total length of the URI including the query string must be less than 8,192 characters.
Size Quotas on Request Body with the Include Body Option
When you choose the Include Body option to expose the request body to your Lambda@Edge function, the following size quotas apply to the portions of the body that are exposed or replaced.
Note
The body is always base64 encoded by Lambda@Edge before it is exposed.
Size Quotas when Exposing the Body to a Lambda Function
If the request body is large, Lambda@Edge truncates it before exposing it, as follows:
 For viewer requests, the body is truncated at 40 KB.
 For origin requests, the body is truncated at 1 MB.
Size Quotas when Returning a Request Body from a Lambda Function
If you access the request body as read-only, the full original request body is sent to the origin. However, if you choose to replace the request body, the following body size quotas apply when it’s returned from a Lambda function:




Type of body encoding
Allowed body size: Viewer request
Allowed body size: Origin request
