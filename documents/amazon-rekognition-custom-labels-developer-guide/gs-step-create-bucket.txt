Step 2: Create Your First Project
The Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console is where you create and manage your models. The first time you use the console, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels asks to create an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. The bucket is used to store your Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels projects, datasets, and models. You can't use the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console unless the bucket is created.
Within Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels, you use projects to manage the models that you create. A project manages the input images and labels, datasets, model training, model evaluation, and running the model. For more information, see Creating an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Project.
