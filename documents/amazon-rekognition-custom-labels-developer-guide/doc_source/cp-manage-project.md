An Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project is a grouping of the resources that are needed to create and manage an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model\. You use a project to manage your datasets and models

Dataset – The labeled images used to train a model\. There can be multiple datasets in a project\. To train a model, you need a training dataset and a test dataset\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Dataset](cd-create-dataset.md)\.

Model – A machine learning model created by Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels that analyzes images for objects, scenes, and concepts\. For more information, see [Training an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Model](tm-train-model.md)\. 

If you no longer need a project, you can delete it with the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console or with the API\.
