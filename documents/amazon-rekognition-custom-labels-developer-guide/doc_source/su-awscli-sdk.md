# Step 2: Set Up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs<a name="su-awscli-sdk"></a>

The following steps show you how to install the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) and AWS SDKs that the examples in this documentation use\. There are a number of different ways to authenticate AWS SDK calls\. The examples in this guide assume that you're using a default credentials profile for calling AWS CLI commands and AWS SDK API operations\.

For a list of available AWS Regions, see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

Follow the steps to download and configure the AWS SDKs\.

**To set up the AWS CLI and the AWS SDKs**

1. Download and install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install) and the AWS SDKs that you want to use\. This guide provides examples for the AWS CLI, Java, and Python\. For information about installing AWS SDKs, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)\.

1. Create an access key for the user you created in [Step 2: Create an IAM Administrator User and Group](su-account-user.md)\.

   1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

   1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

   1. Choose the name of the user you created in [Step 2: Create an IAM Administrator User and Group](su-account-user.md)\.

   1. Choose the **Security credentials** tab\.

   1. Choose **Create access key**\. Then choose **Download \.csv file** to save the access key ID and secret access key to a CSV file on your computer\. Store the file in a secure location\. You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes\. After you have downloaded the CSV file, choose **Close**\. 

1. If you have installed the AWS CLI, you can configure the credentials and Region for most AWS SDKs by entering `aws configure` at the command prompt\. Otherwise, use the following instructions\.

1. On your computer, navigate to your home directory, and create an `.aws` directory\. On Unix\-based systems, such as Linux or macOS, this is in the following location: 

   ```
   ~/.aws
   ```

   On Windows, this is in the following location:

   ```
   %HOMEPATH%\.aws
   ```

1. In the `.aws` directory, create a new file named `credentials`\. 

1. Open the credentials CSV file that you created in step 2\. Copy its contents into the `credentials` file using the following format:

   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
   aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
   ```

   Substitute your access key ID and secret access key for *your\_access\_key\_id* and *your\_secret\_access\_key*\.

1. Save the `Credentials` file and delete the CSV file\.

1. In the `.aws` directory, create a new file named `config`\. 

1. Open the `config` file and enter your Region in the following format\.

   ```
   [default]
   region = your_aws_region
   ```

   Substitute your desired AWS Region \(for example, "us\-west\-2"\) for *your\_aws\_region*\. 
**Note**  
If you don't select a Region, then us\-east\-1 is used by default\. 

1. Save the `config` file\.
