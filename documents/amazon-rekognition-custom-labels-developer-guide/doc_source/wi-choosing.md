## Amazon Rekognition Label Detection<a name="wi-label-detection"></a>

Customers across media and entertainment, advertising and marketing, industrial, agricultural, and other segments need to identify, classify, and search for important objects, scenes, and other concepts in their images and videosâ€”at scale\. Amazon Rekognition's label detection feature makes it fast and easy to detect thousands of common objects \(such as cars and trucks, corn and tomatoes, and basketballs and soccer balls\) within images and video by using computer vision and machine learning technologies\. 

However, you can't find specialized objects using Amazon Rekognition label detection\. For example, sports leagues want to identify team logos on player jerseys and helmets during game footage, media networks would like to detect specific sponsor logos to report on advertiser coverage, manufacturers need to distinguish between specific machine parts or products in an assembly line to monitor quality, and other customers want to identify cartoon characters in a media library, or locate products of a specific brand on retail shelves\. Amazon Rekognition labels don't help you detect these specialized objects\.
