Step 1: Create an AWS Account
In this section, you sign up for an AWS account. If you already have an AWS account, skip this step.
When you sign up for Amazon Web Services (AWS), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all AWS services, including IAM. You are charged only for the services that you use. 
To create an AWS account

Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.
