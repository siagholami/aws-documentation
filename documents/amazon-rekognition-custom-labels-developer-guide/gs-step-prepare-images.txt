Step 1: Prepare Your Images

Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels requires images to train and test your model. To prepare your images, consider following:
 Choose a specific domain for the model you want to create. For example, you could choose a model for scenic views and another model for objects such as machine parts. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels works best if your images are in the chosen domain.
 Use at least 10 images to train your model.
 Images must be in PNG or JPEG format.
 Use images that show the object in a variety of lightings, backgrounds, and resolutions.
 Training and testing images should be similar to the images that you want to use the model with. 
 Decide what labels to assign to the images. For more information, see Assigning Image-Level Labels to an Image.
 Ensure that images are sufficiently large in terms of resolution. For more information, see Limits in Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels.
 Ensure that occlusions don't obscure objects that you want to detect.
 Use images that have sufficient contrast with the background. 
 Use images that are bright and sharp. Avoid using images that may be blurry due to subject and camera motion as much as possible.
 Use an image where the object occupies a large proportion of the image.
Note
If you are training your model to detect scenes or concepts, you don't need to do Step 6: Identify Objects with Bounding Boxes. Similarly, if you're training a model to detect objects, you don't need to do Step 5: Identify Scenes and Concepts with Image-Level Labels.
