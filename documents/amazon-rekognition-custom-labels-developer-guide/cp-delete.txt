Deleting an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Project
You can delete a project by using the Amazon Rekognition console or by calling the DeleteProject API. To delete a project, you must first delete each associated model. A deleted project or model can't be undeleted.

Deleting an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Project (Console)
You can delete a project from the projects page, or you can delete a project from a project's detail page. The following procedure shows you how to delete a project using the projects page.
The Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console deletes associated models for you during project deletion, except when a model is running or training. If a model is running, use the StopProjectVersion API to stop the model. For more information, see Stopping an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Model (SDK). If a model is training, wait until it finishes before you delete the project.
To delete a project (console)


Open the Amazon Rekognition console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/.


Choose Use Custom Labels.


Choose Get started. 


In the left navigation pane, choose Projects.


On the Projects page, select the radio button for the project that you want to delete.



Choose Delete at the top of the page. The Delete project dialog box is shown.


If the project has no associated models:


Enter delete to delete the model.


Choose Delete to delete the project.


If the project has associated models:


Enter delete to confirm that you want to delete the model(s).


Choose Delete associated models. Model deletion might take a while to complete.
Note
The console can't delete models that are in-training or running. Try again after stopping any running models that are listed, and wait until models listed as training finish.
If you Close the dialog box during model deletion, the models are still deleted. Later, you can delete the project by repeating this procedure. 



Enter delete to confirm that you want to delete the project.


Choose Delete to delete the project.



Deleting an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Project (SDK)
You delete an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project by calling DeleteProject and supplying the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project that you want to delete. To get the ARNs of the projects in your account, call DescribeProjects. The response includes an array of ProjectDescription objects. The project ARN is the ProjectArn field. You can use the project name to identify the ARN of the project. For example, arn:aws:rekognition:us-east-1:123456789010:project/project name/1234567890123. 
Before you can delete a project, you must first delete all models in the project. For more information, see Deleting an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Model (SDK). The project might take a few moments to delete. During that time, the status of the project is DELETING. The project is deleted if a subsequent call to DescribeProjects doesn't include the project that you deleted.
To delete a project (SDK)


If you haven't already:


Create or update an IAM user with AmazonRekognitionFullAccess permissions. For more information, see Step 2: Create an IAM Administrator User and Group.


Install and configure the AWS CLI and the AWS SDKs. For more information, see Step 2: Set Up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs.


Use the following code to delete a project. 



[ AWS CLI ]
Change the value of project-arn to the name of the project that you want to create.
aws rekognition delete-project --project-arn project_arn

[ Python ]
Change the value of project_arn to the name of the project you want to delete.
