Step 9: Start Your Model
If you're happy with the performance of your model, you make it available for use by starting it. The console provides example code that you use to start the model. To run the example code, you need to set up the AWS SDK. For more information, see Step 2: Set Up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs. 
Note
You are charged for the amount of time, in minutes, that the model is running. For more information, see Inference hours. 
Starting a model takes a while to complete. You can use the console to determine if the model is running. Alternatively you can use the DescribeProjectVersions API to get the current status. For more information, see Running a Trained Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Model.
To start a model (console)


If you haven't already:


Create or update an IAM user with AmazonRekognitionFullAccess and AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess permissions. For more information, see Step 2: Create an IAM Administrator User and Group.


Install and configure the latest version of the AWS CLI. For more information, see Step 2: Set Up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs.


On the Projects resources page, choose the project that contains the trained model that you want to start.


In the Models section, choose the model that you want to start. The summary results are shown. 


In the Use model section, choose API Code. 


At the command prompt, use the AWS CLI command that calls start-project-version to start your model. The value of --project-version-arn should be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your model.


aws rekognition start-project-version \
     --project-version-arn "model_arn" \
     --min-inference-units 1\
     --region us-east-1


Choose your project name at the top of the page to go back to the project overview page.


In the Model section, check the status of the model. When the status is The model is running, you can use the model to analyze images.
