# Amazon SQS Examples<a name="sqs-examples"></a>

Amazon Simple Queue Service \(SQS\) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully managed message queuing service\. Amazon SQS lets you decouple the components of a cloud application\. Amazon SQS includes standard queues with high throughput and at\-least\-once processing, and FIFO queues that provide FIFO \(first\-in, first\-out\) delivery and exactly\-once processing\.

The JavaScript API for Amazon SQS is exposed through the `AWS.SQS` client class\. For more information about using the CloudWatch client class, see [Class: AWS\.SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/SQS.html) in the API reference\.
