Loading the SDK for JavaScript
How you load the SDK for JavaScript depends on whether you are loading it to run in a web browser or in Node.js.
Not all services are immediately available in the SDK. To find out which services are currently supported by the AWS SDK for JavaScript, see https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/SERVICES.md

[ Node.js ]
After you install the SDK, you can load the AWS package in your node application using require. 
var AWS = require('aws-sdk');

[ React Native ]
To use the SDK in a React Native project, first install the SDK using npm:
npm install aws-sdk
In your application, reference the React Native compatible version of the SDK with the following code:
var AWS = require('aws-sdk/dist/aws-sdk-react-native');

[ Browser ]
The quickest way to get started with the SDK is to load the hosted SDK package directly from Amazon Web Services. To do this, add a <script> element to your HTML pages in the following form:
<script src="https://sdk.amazonaws.com/js/aws-sdk-SDK_VERSION_NUMBER.min.js"></script>
To find the current SDK_VERSION_NUMBER, see the API Reference for the SDK for JavaScript at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/index.html.
After the SDK loads in your page, the SDK is available from the global variable AWS (or window.AWS).
If you bundle your code and module dependencies using browserify, you load the SDK using require, just as you do in Node.js.
