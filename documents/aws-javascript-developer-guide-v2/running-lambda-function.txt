To run the browser application


Open a web browser.


Point the browser at the URL for the Amazon S3 bucket that hosts the application.



Select the handle on the right side of the slot machine. The wheels begin to spin as the browser script invokes the Lambda function to generate results for this turn.



Once the Lambda function returns the spin results to the browser script, the browser script sets the game display to show the images that the Lambda function selected.


Select the handle again to start another spin.
