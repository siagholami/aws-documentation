# Reporting Events<a name="mobile-sdk-android-events"></a>

You can use the AWS Mobile SDK for Android to report app usage data, or *events*, to Amazon Pinpoint\. Report events to capture information such as app session times, users' purchasing behavior, sign\-in attempts, or any custom event type that serves your needs\.

After your app reports events, view app analytics in the Amazon Pinpoint console\. The charts on the **Analytics** page provide metrics for many aspects of user behavior\. For more information, see [Chart Reference for Amazon Pinpoint Analytics](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/analytics-charts.html) in the *Amazon Pinpoint User Guide*\.

To analyze and store your event data outside of Amazon Pinpoint, you can configure Amazon Pinpoint to stream the data to Amazon Kinesis\. For more information, see [Streaming Amazon Pinpoint Events to Kinesis](analytics-streaming.md)\.

## Recording Monetization Events<a name="mobile-sdk-android-events-monetization"></a>

To track the revenue that is generated by your app and the number of items purchased by users, update your app code to report monetization events\.

After your app reports monetization events, view revenue analytics in the Amazon Pinpoint console\. On the **Analytics** page, the **Revenue** tab provides charts for **Revenue**, **Paying users**, **Units sold**, and more\.

The following example uses the `AnalyticsClient` of the `PinpointManager` class to record and submit a monetization event\.

```
final AnalyticsEvent event = GooglePlayMonetizationEventBuilder.create(AWSMobileClient.defaultMobileClient()
        .getPinpointManager().getAnalyticsClient())
    .withCurrency("USD")
    .withItemPrice(1.00)
    .withProductId("PRODUCT_ID")
    .withQuantity(1.0)
    .withTransactionId("TRANSACTION_ID").build();
AWSMobileClient.defaultMobileClient()
        .getPinpointManager().getAnalyticsClient().recordEvent(event);
AWSMobileClient.defaultMobileClient()
        .getPinpointManager().getAnalyticsClient().submitEvents();
```

## Reporting Authentication Events<a name="mobile-sdk-android-events-auth"></a>

To learn how frequently users authenticate with your app, update your app code so that Amazon Pinpoint receives the following standard event types for authentication:

+ `_userauth.sign_in`

+ `_userauth.sign_up`

+ `_userauth.auth_fail`

After Amazon Pinpoint receives these event types, use the **Analytics** page in the Amazon Pinpoint console to view charts for **Sign\-ins**, **Sign\-ups**, and **Authentication failures**\.

You can report authentication events by doing either of the following:

+ Managing user sign\-up and sign\-in with Amazon Cognito user pools\.

+ Submitting events with the `PinpointManager` class\.

Amazon Cognito user pools provide user directories that make it easier to add sign\-up and sign\-in to your app\. As users authenticate with your app, Amazon Cognito reports authentication events to Amazon Pinpoint\. For more information, see [Using Amazon Pinpoint Analytics with Amazon Cognito User Pools](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-pinpoint-integration.html) in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*\.

If you don't want to use Amazon Cognito user pools, you can use the `AnalyticsClient` of the `PinpointManager` class to record and submit authentication events, as shown in the following example\. The event type is set to `_userauth.sign_in`, but you can substitute any authentication event type\.

```
final AnalyticsEvent event =  AWSMobileClient.defaultMobileClient()
        .getPinpointManager().getAnalyticsClient().createEvent("_userauth.sign_in")
AWSMobileClient.defaultMobileClient()
        .getPinpointManager().getAnalyticsClient().recordEvent(event);
AWSMobileClient.defaultMobileClient()
        .getPinpointManager().getAnalyticsClient().submitEvents();
```

## Reporting Custom Events<a name="mobile-sdk-android-events-custom"></a>

A custom event must have an event type, and you can add custom attributes and metrics to that event\.

In the following example, the `AWSMobileClient` class is provided in the AWS Mobile Hub sample code to reference the Amazon Pinpoint object\.

```
final AnalyticsEvent event =  AWSMobileClient.defaultMobileClient()
        .getPinpointManager().getAnalyticsClient().createEvent("MyCustomEvent")
    // A music app use case might include attributes such as:
    // .withAttribute("Playlist", "Amazing Songs 2016")
    // .withAttribute("Artist", "Various")
    // .withMetric("Song playtime", playTime);
    .withAttribute("MyAttribute1", "MyAttributeValue1")
    .withAttribute("MyAttribute2", "MyAttributeValue2")
    .withMetric("MyMetric1", Math.random());

AWSMobileClient.defaultMobileClient()
        .getPinpointManager().getAnalyticsClient().recordEvent(event);
AWSMobileClient.defaultMobileClient()
        .getPinpointManager().getAnalyticsClient().submitEvents();
```
