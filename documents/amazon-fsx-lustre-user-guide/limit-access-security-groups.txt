File System Access Control with Amazon VPC
An Amazon FSx file system is accessible through an elastic network interface that resides in the virtual private cloud (VPC) based on the Amazon VPC service that you associate with your file system. You access your Amazon FSx file system through its DNS name, which maps to the file system's network interface. Only resources within the associated VPC, or a peered VPC, can access your file system's network interface. For more information, see What is Amazon VPC? in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Warning
You must not modify or delete the Amazon FSx elastic network interface. Modifying or deleting the network interface can cause a permanent loss of connection between your VPC and your file system.
Amazon VPC Security Groups
To further control network traffic going through your file system's network interface within your VPC, you use security groups to limit access to your file systems. A security group acts as a virtual firewall to control the traffic for its associated resources. In this case, the associated resource is your file system's network interface. You also use VPC security groups to control network traffic for your Lustre clients. 
Controlling Access Using Inbound and Outbound Rules
To use a security group to control access to your Amazon FSx file system and Lustre clients, you add the inbound rules to control incoming traffic and outbound rules to control the outgoing traffic from your file system and Lustre clients. Make sure to have the right network traffic rules in your security group to map your Amazon FSx file system's file share to a folder on your supported compute instance. 
For more information on security group rules, see Security Group Rules in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. 
To create a security group for your Amazon FSx File System


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2.


In the navigation pane, choose Security Groups.


Choose Create Security Group.


Specify a name and description for the security group.


For VPC, choose the VPC associated with your Amazon FSx file system to create the security group within that VPC.


Choose Create to create the security group. 


Next, you add inbound rules to the security group that you just created to enable Lustre traffic between your Amazon FSx for Lustre file servers.
To add inbound rules to your security group


Select the security group you just created if it's not already selected. For Actions, choose Edit inbound rules.


Add the following inbound rules.  
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Choose Save to save and apply the new inbound rules.


By default, security group rules allow all outbound traffic (All, 0.0.0.0/0). If your security group doesn't allow all outbound traffic, add the following outbound rules to your security group. These rules allow traffic between Amazon FSx for Lustre file servers and Lustre clients, and between Lustre file servers.
To add outbound rules to your security group


Choose the same security group to which you just added the inbound rules. For Actions, choose Edit outbound rules. 


Add the following outbound rules.  
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Choose Save to save and apply the new outbound rules.


To associate a security group with your Amazon FSx file system


Open the Amazon FSx console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/.


On the console dashboard, chose your file system to view its details.


On the Network & Security tab, choose your file system's network interface IDs (for example, ENI-01234567890123456). Doing this redirects you to the Amazon EC2 console.


Choose each network interface ID. Each action opens a new instance of the Amazon EC2 console in your browser. For each security group, choose Change Security Groups for Actions. 


In the Change Security Groups dialog box, choose the security groups to use, and choose Save.


Lustre Client VPC Security Group Rules
You use VPC security groups to control access to your Lustre clients by adding inbound rules to control incoming traffic and outbound rules to control the outgoing traffic from your Lustre clients. Make sure to have the right network traffic rules in your security group to ensure that Lustre traffic can flow between your Lustre clients and your Amazon FSx file systems.
Add the following inbound rules to the security groups applied to your Lustre clients.
