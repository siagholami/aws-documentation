Using Data Repository Tasks
You can create, duplicate, view details, and cancel data repository tasks using the Amazon FSx console, CLI, or API.
Note
We recommend that you download the latest AWS CLI so that you have access to all the required functionality. For more information, see Installing the AWS CLI in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. Look for the Upgrade section for your operating system.
Creating a Data Repository Task
You can create a data repository task by using the Amazon FSx console, CLI, or API. After you create a task, you can view the task's progress and status by using the console, CLI, or API. 
To Create a Data Repository Task (Console)


Open the Amazon FSx console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/.


On the navigation pane, choose File systems, then choose the Lustre file system that you want to create the task for.


For Actions, choose Export to data repository. This choice is not available if the file system isn't linked to a data repository on S3. The Create data repository task page appears.



Data repository task type is set to Export to repository, which is the only task type currently supported. The Export destination value is the export prefix that you defined when you created the file system.


(Optional) Specify up to 32 directories or files to export from your Amazon FSx file system by providing the paths to those directories or files in File system export paths. The paths you provide need to be relative to the mount point of the file system. If the mount point is /mnt/fsx and /mnt/fsx/path1 is a directory or file on the file system you want to export, then the path to provide is path1.
Note
If a path that you provide isn't valid, the task fails.


(Optional) Choose Enable under Completion report to generate a task completion report after the task completes. A task completion report provides details about the files processed by the task that meet the scope provided in Report scope. To specify the location for Amazon FSx to deliver the report, enter a relative path on the file system's linked S3 data repository for Report path.


Choose Create data repository task. 


A notification at the top of the File systems page shows the task that you just created in progress. 
To view the task status and details, choose Data repository tasks (Lustre) on the navigation pane. The default sort order shows the most recent task at the top of the list. 
To view a task summary from this page, choose Task ID for the task you just created. The Summary page for the task appears. 
To Create a Data Repository Task (CLI)
The following procedure creates an export to repository task. Amazon FSx generates a task completion report after the task completes. If you don't want to generate a report, set --report Enabled to false. For more information about task completion reports, see Working with Task Completion Reports.
 To create a data repository task, use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/fsx/create-data-repository-task.html CLI command. The corresponding API operation is  CreateDataRepositoryTask.
$ aws fsx create-data-repository-task \
      --file-system-id fs-0123456789abcdef0 \
      --type EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY \
      --paths path1,path2/file1 \
      --report Enabled=true,Scope=FAILED_FILES_ONLY,Format=REPORT_CSV_20191124,Path=s3://dataset-01/reports
After successfully creating the data repository task, Amazon FSx returns the task description as JSON, as shown in the following example.
{
    "Task": {
        "TaskId": "task-123f8cd8e330c1321",
        "Type": "EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY",
        "Lifecycle": "PENDING",
        "FileSystemId": "fs-0123456789abcdef0",
        "Paths": ["path1", "path2/file1"],
        "Report": {
            "Path":"s3://dataset-01/reports",
            "Format":"REPORT_CSV_20191124",
            "Enabled":true,
            "Scope":"FAILED_FILES_ONLY"
        },
        "CreationTime": "1545070680.240",
        "ClientRequestToken": "10192019-drt-12",
        "ResourceARN": "arn:aws:fsx:us-east-1:123456789012:task:task-123f8cd8e330c1321"
    }
}
After Amazon FSx begins processing the task, the task's status information becomes available. To view task details and status using the CLI, see To Retrieve Data Repository Tasks and Task Details (CLI).
Duplicating a Task
You can duplicate an existing data repository task in the Amazon FSx console. When you duplicate a task, an exact copy of the existing task is displayed in the Create data repository task page. You can make changes to the paths to export, as needed, before creating and running the new task. 
You can duplicate a task from the task details view or from the Data repository tasks page.
To duplicate an existing task
You can duplicate a task from the task details page or for the Data repository tasks page.


Choose a task on the Data repository tasks (Lustre) page.


Choose Duplicate task. The Create data repository task page appears. All settings for the new task are identical to those for the task that you're duplicating.


Change or add the paths that you want to export to. The paths you provide need to be relative to the mount point of the file system. If the mount point is /mnt/fsx and /mnt/fsx/path1 is a directory or file on the file system you want to export, then the path to provide is path1.


Choose Create data repository task to create the task.


Accessing Data Repository Tasks
After you create a data repository task, you can access the task, and all existing tasks in your account, using the Amazon FSx console, CLI, and API. Amazon FSx provides the following detailed task information: 
 All existing tasks.
 All tasks for a specific file system.
 All tasks with a specific lifecycle status. For more information about task lifecycle status values, see Understanding a Task's Status and Details.
You can access all existing data repository tasks in your account by using the Amazon FSx console, CLI, or API, as described following.
To View Data Repository Tasks and Task Details (Console)


Open the Amazon FSx console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/.


On the navigation pane, choose Data repository tasks (Lustre). The Data repository tasks page appears, showing existing tasks.


To see a task's details, choose Task ID or Task name in the Data repository tasks page. The task detail page appears.



To Retrieve Data Repository Tasks and Task Details (CLI)
Using the Amazon FSx https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/fsx/describe-data-repository-tasks.html CLI command, you can view all the data repository tasks, and their details, in your account. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDataRepositoryTasks.html is the equivalent API command.
 Use the following command to view all data repository task objects in your account.
aws fsx describe-data-repository-tasks
If the command is successful, Amazon FSx returns the response in JSON format.

Canceling a Data Repository Task
You can cancel a data repository task while it's in either the PENDING or EXECUTING state. When you cancel a task, the following occurs:
 Amazon FSx doesn't process any files that are in the queue to be processed.
 Amazon FSx continues processing any files that are currently in process.
 Amazon FSx doesn't revert any files that the task already processed.
To Cancel a Data Repository Task (Console)
