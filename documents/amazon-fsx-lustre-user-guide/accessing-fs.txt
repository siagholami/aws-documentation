Accessing File Systems
Using Amazon FSx, you can burst your compute-intensive workloads from on-premises into the AWS Cloud by importing data over AWS Direct Connect or VPN. You can access your Amazon FSx file system from on-premises, copy data into your file system as-needed, and run compute-intensive workloads on in-cloud instances.
In the following section, you can learn how to access your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system on a Linux instance. In addition, you can find how to use the fileÂ fstab to automatically remount your file system after any system restarts.
Before you can mount a file system, you must create, configure, and launch your related AWS resources. For detailed instructions, see Getting Started with Amazon FSx for Lustre. Next, you can install and configure the Lustre client on your compute instance.
