# Monitoring Amazon FSx for Lustre<a name="monitoring_overview"></a>

With Amazon FSx for Lustre, you can monitor activity for your file systems using Amazon CloudWatch metrics\.

## Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a>

You can monitor file systems using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from Amazon FSx for Lustre into readable, near real\-time metrics\. These statistics are retained for a period of 15 months, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing\. By default, Amazon FSx for Lustre metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch at 1\-minute periods\. For more information about CloudWatch, see [What Is Amazon CloudWatch?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

As with Amazon EFS, Amazon S3, and Amazon EBS, Amazon FSx for Lustre CloudWatch metrics are reported as raw *Bytes*\. Bytes are not rounded to either a decimal or binary multiple of the unit\.

Amazon FSx for Lustre publishes the following metrics into the `AWS/FSx` namespace in CloudWatch\. For each metric, Amazon FSx for Lustre emits a data point per disk per minute\. To view aggregate file system details, you can use the `Sum` statistic\. Note that the file servers behind your Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems are spread across multiple disks\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| DataReadBytes |  The number of bytes for file system read operations\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with read operations during the period\. The `Minimum` statistic is the minimum number of bytes associated with read operations on a single disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the maximum number of bytes associated with read operations on the disk\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of bytes associated with read operations per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. To calculate the average throughput \(bytes per second\) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/monitoring_overview.html) Valid statistics: `Sum`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `SampleCount`  | 
| DataWriteBytes |  The number of bytes for file system write operations\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes associated with write operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the minimum number of bytes associated with write operations on a single disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the maximum number of bytes associated with write operations on the disk\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of bytes associated with write operations per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. To calculate the average throughput \(bytes per second\) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/monitoring_overview.html) Valid statistics: `Sum`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `SampleCount`  | 
| DataReadOperations |  The number of read operations\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of read operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the minimum number of read operations on a single disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the maximum number of read operations on the disk\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of read operations per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. To calculate the average number of read operations \(operations per second\) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/monitoring_overview.html) Valid statistics: `Sum`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `SampleCount`  | 
| DataWriteOperations |  The number of write operations\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of write operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the minimum number of write operations on a single disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the maximum number write operations on the disk\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of write operations per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. To calculate the average number of write operations \(operations per second\) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/monitoring_overview.html) Valid statistics: `Sum`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `SampleCount`  | 
| MetadataOperations |  The number of metadata operations\. The `Sum` statistic is the count of metadata operations\. The `Minimum` statistic is the minimum number of metadata operations per disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the maximum number of metadata operations per disk\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of metadata operations per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. To calculate the average number of metadata operations \(operations per second\) for a period, divide the `Sum` statistic by the number of seconds in the period\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/monitoring_overview.html) Valid statistics: `Sum`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `SampleCount`  | 
| FreeDataStorageCapacity |  The amount of available storage capacity\. The `Sum` statistic is the total number of bytes available in the file system\. The `Minimum` statistic is the total number bytes available in the fullest disk\. The `Maximum` statistic is the total number of bytes available in the disk with the most remaining available storage\. The `Average` statistic is the average number of bytes available per disk\. The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of disks\. Units: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/monitoring_overview.html) Valid statistics: `Sum`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, `Average`, `SampleCount`  | 

## Amazon FSx for Lustre Dimensions<a name="fsx-dimensions"></a>

Amazon FSx for Lustre metrics use the `FSx` namespace and provide metrics for a single dimension, `FileSystemId`\. A file system's ID can be found using the `aws fsx describe-file-systems` AWS CLI command, and it takes the form of *fs\-01234567890123456*\.
