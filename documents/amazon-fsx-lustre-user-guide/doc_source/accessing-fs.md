# Accessing File Systems<a name="accessing-fs"></a>

Using Amazon FSx, you can burst your compute\-intensive workloads from on\-premises into the AWS Cloud by importing data over AWS Direct Connect or VPN\. You can access your Amazon FSx file system from on\-premises, copy data into your file system as\-needed, and run compute\-intensive workloads on in\-cloud instances\.

In the following section, you can learn how to access your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system on a Linux instance\. In addition, you can find how to use the fileÂ `fstab` to automatically remount your file system after any system restarts\.

Before you can mount a file system, you must create, configure, and launch your related AWS resources\. For detailed instructions, see [Getting Started with Amazon FSx for Lustre](getting-started.md)\. Next, you can install and configure the Lustre client on your compute instance\.
