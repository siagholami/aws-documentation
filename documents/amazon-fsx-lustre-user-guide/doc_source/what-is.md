# What Is Amazon FSx for Lustre?<a name="what-is"></a>

Amazon FSx for Lustre makes it easy and cost\-effective to launch and run the popular, high\-performance Lustre file system\. You use Lustre for workloads where speed matters, such as machine learning, high performance computing \(HPC\), video processing, and financial modeling\.

The open\-source Lustre file system is designed for applications that require fast storageâ€”where you want your storage to keep up with your compute\. Lustre was built to solve the problem of quickly and cheaply processing the world's ever\-growing datasets\. It's a widely used file system designed for the fastest computers in the world\. It provides submillisecond latencies, up to hundreds of GBps of throughput, and up to millions of IOPS\. For more information on Lustre, see the [Lustre website](http://lustre.org/)\. 

As a fully managed service, Amazon FSx makes it easier for you to use Lustre for workloads where storage speed matters\. Amazon FSx for Lustre eliminates the traditional complexity of setting up and managing Lustre file systems, enabling you to spin up and run a battle\-tested high\-performance file system in minutes\. It also provides multiple deployment options so you can optimize cost for your needs\.

 Amazon FSx for Lustre is POSIX\-compliant, so you can use your current Linux\-based applications without having to make any changes\. Amazon FSx for Lustre provides a native file system interface and works as any file system does with your Linux operating system\. It also provides read\-after\-write consistency and supports file locking\. 

## Multiple Deployment Options<a name="deployment-options"></a>

Amazon FSx for Lustre offers a choice of *scratch* and *persistent* file systems to accommodate different data processing needs\. Scratch file systems are ideal for temporary storage and shorter\-term processing of data\. Data is not replicated and does not persist if a file server fails\. Persistent file systems are ideal for longer\-term storage and workloads\. In persistent file systems, data is replicated, and file servers are replaced if they fail\. For more information, see [File System Deployment Options for Amazon FSx for Lustre ](using-fsx-lustre.md#lustre-deployment-types)\.

## Amazon FSx for Lustre and Data Repositories<a name="data-repo-features"></a>

You can use Amazon FSx for Lustre to process cloud datasets stored for the longer\-term on persistent file systems, Amazon S3, or your on\-premises data repository using in\-cloud compute instances\.

### Amazon S3 Integration<a name="s3-integration"></a>

Amazon FSx for Lustre integrates with Amazon S3, making it easy for you to process cloud datasets using the Lustre high\-performance file system\. You can use Amazon FSx for Lustre to process cloud datasets stored in Amazon S3 by linking an S3 bucket to the file system\. When linked to an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system transparently presents S3 objects as files\. Amazon FSx imports listings of all existing files in your S3 bucket at file system creation\. Amazon FSx can also import listings of files added to the data repository after the file system is created\. You can set the import preferences to match your workflow needs\. The file system also enables you to write file system data back to S3\. Data repository tasks simplify the transfer of data and metadata between your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system and its durable data repository on Amazon S3\. For more information, see [Using data repositories with Amazon FSx for Lustre](fsx-data-repositories.md) and [Data repository tasks](data-repository-tasks.md)\. 

### On\-Premises Data Repositories<a name="on-prem-repo"></a>

 With Amazon FSx for Lustre, you can burst your data processing workloads from on\-premises into the AWS Cloud by importing data using AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN\. For more information, see [Using Amazon FSx with Your On\-Premises Data Repository](fsx-on-premises.md)\.

## Accessing File Systems<a name="compute-access"></a>

With Amazon FSx for Lustre, you can mix and match the instance types and Linux Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\) that are connected to a single file system\.

 Amazon FSx for Lustre is accessible from compute workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances and containers running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(Amazon EKS\)\. You access your file system from your Amazon EC2 compute instances using the open\-source Lustre client\. After your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system is mounted, you can work with its files and directories just as you do using a local file system\. You access Amazon FSx for Lustre from containers running on Amazon EKS using the open\-source [FSx for Lustre CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fsx-csi.html), as described in **Amazon EKS User Guide**\. Your containers running on Amazon EKS can use high\-performance persistent volumes \(PVs\) backed by Amazon FSx for Lustre\. 

 Amazon FSx for Lustre is compatible with the most popular Linux\-based AMIs, including Amazon Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux \(RHEL\), CentOS, Ubuntu, and SUSE Linux\. The Lustre client is included with Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux\. For RHEL, CentOS, and Ubuntu, an AWS Lustre client repository provides clients that are compatible with these operating systems\. 

Using Amazon FSx, you can burst your compute\-intensive workloads from on\-premises into the AWS Cloud by importing data over AWS Direct Connect or VPN\. You can access your Amazon FSx file system from on\-premises, copy data into your file system as\-needed, and run compute\-intensive workloads on in\-cloud instances\.

For more information, see [Accessing File Systems](accessing-fs.md)\.

## Integrations with AWS Services<a name="integration-aws-services"></a>

 Amazon FSx for Lustre integrates with Amazon SageMaker as an input data source\. When using Amazon SageMaker with Amazon FSx for Lustre, your machine learning training jobs are accelerated by eliminating the initial download step from Amazon S3\. Additionally, your total cost of ownership \(TCO\) is reduced by avoiding the repetitive download of common objects for iterative jobs on the same dataset as you save on S3 requests costs\. For more information, see [What Is Amazon SageMaker?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) in the *Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide* 

Amazon FSx for Lustre integrates with AWS Batch using EC2 Launch Templates\. AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud, including high\-performance computing \(HPC\), machine learning \(ML\), and other asynchronous workloads\. AWS Batch automatically and dynamically sizes instances based on job resource requirements\. For more information, see [What Is AWS Batch?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/what-is-batch.html) in the *AWS Batch User Guide*\. 

 Amazon FSx for Lustre integrates with AWS ParallelCluster\. AWS ParallelCluster is an AWS\-supported open\-source cluster management tool used to deploy and manage HPC clusters\. It can automatically create Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems or use existing file systems during the cluster creation process\. 

## Security and Compliance<a name="security-compliance"></a>

Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems support encryption at rest and in transit\. Amazon FSx automatically encrypts file system data at rest using keys managed in AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\)\. Data in transit is also automatically encrypted on file systems in certain AWS Regions when accessed from supported EC2 instances\. For more information about data encryption in Amazon FSx for Lustre, including AWS Regions where encryption of data in transit is supported, see [Data Encryption in Amazon FSx for Lustre](encryption-fsxl.md)\.
