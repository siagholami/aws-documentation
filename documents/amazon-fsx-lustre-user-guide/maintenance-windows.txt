Amazon FSx for Lustre Maintenance Windows
Amazon FSx for Lustre performs routine software patching for the Lustre software it manages. The maintenance window is your opportunity to control what day and time of the week this software patching occurs.
Patching occurs infrequently, typically once every several weeks. Patching should require only a fraction of your 30-minute maintenance window. During these few minutes of time, your file system will be temporarily unavailable. 
You choose the maintenance window during file system creation. If you have no time preference, then a 30-minute default window is assigned.
You can use the Amazon FSx Management Console, AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs to change the maintenance window for your file systems.
