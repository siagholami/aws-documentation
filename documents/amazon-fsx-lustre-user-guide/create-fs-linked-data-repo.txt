Linking your file system to an S3 bucket
When you create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, you can link it to a durable data repository in Amazon S3. Before you create your file system, make sure you have already created the S3 bucket that you will use as the repository. In the Create file system wizard, you set the following data repository configuration properties in the optional Data repository import/export panel. 
 Choose how Amazon FSx imports new and changed files from the linked data repository after the initial import after the file system is created. For more information, see Automatically import updates from your S3 bucket. 
 Import bucket – enter the name of the S3 bucket that you are using for the linked repository.
 Import prefix – enter an optional import prefix if you want to import only some of the data in your Amazon S3 bucket into your file system. The import prefix defines where in your S3 bucket to import data from.
 Export prefix – defines where Amazon FSx will export the contents of your file system to your linked S3 bucket.
Creating file systems linked to an S3 bucket
The following procedures walk you through the process of creating an Amazon FSx file system linked to an S3 bucket using the AWS Management Console and AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
To create a file system linked to an S3 bucket (console)


Open the Amazon FSx console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/.


From the dashboard, choose Create file system.


Choose Amazon FSx for Lustre for the file system type, and then choose Next.


Provide the information required for the File system details and Network and security sections. For more information, see Step 1: Create Your Amazon FSx for Lustre File System.


You use the Data repository import/export panel to configure a linked data repository in Amazon S3.
Select Import data from and export data to S3 to expand the panel and configure the data repository settings.



Choose how Amazon FSx imports new and changed files from the linked S3 bucket. By default, Amazon FSx imports file listings at file system creation, and then whenever new files are added to the S3 bucket after this initial import. 
    Import objects that are added to my bucket - (Default) Amazon FSx automatically imports any new objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do not currently exist in the FSx file system. Amazon FSx does not import updated files to the FSx file system. Amazon FSx does not delete files from the file system that are deleted from the linked S3 bucket.
    Import objects that are added to or changed in my bucket - Amazon FSx automatically imports any new objects added to the S3 bucket and any existing objects that are changed after file system creation, or after you set the import preferences to this option. Amazon FSx does not delete objects from the file system that are deleted from the S3 bucket. 
    Do not import any objects - Amazon FSx only imports files from the linked S3 bucket when the file system is created. FSx does not import any new or changed objects after choosing this option.


Enter an optional Import prefix if you want to import only some of the data in your S3 bucket into your file system. The import prefix defines where in your S3 bucket to import data from. For more information, see Automatically import updates from your S3 bucket.


Choose one of the three Export prefix options:
    A unique prefix that Amazon FSx creates in your bucket – Choose this option to export new and changed objects using a prefix generated by Amazon FSx for Lustre. The prefix looks like the following: /FSxLustrefile-system-creation-timestamp. The timestamp is in UTC format, for example FSxLustre20181105T222312Z. This option is the default. 
    The same prefix that you imported from (replace existing objects with updated ones) – Choose this option to replace existing objects with updated ones.
    A prefix you specify – Choose this option to preserve your imported data and to export new and changed objects using a prefix that you specify. 


(Optional) Set Maintenance preferences or use the system defaults.


Choose Next and review the file system settings. Make any changes if needed.


Choose Create file system.


To create a file system linked to an S3 bucket (AWS CLI)
This example creates an Amazon FSx file system linked to the lustre-export-test-bucket, with an import preferences that imports any new or changed files in the linked data repository after the file system is created.
 To create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, use the Amazon FSx CLI command https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/fsx/create-file-system.html as shown following. The corresponding API operation is CreateFileSystem.
$ aws fsx create-file-system \
        --client-request-token CRT1234 \
        --file-system-type LUSTRE \
        --lustre-configuration AutoImportPolicy=NEW_CHANGED,DeploymentType=PERSISTENT_1,ImportPath=s3://lustre-export-test-bucket/,ExportPath=s3://lustre-export-test-bucket/export \
        --storage-capacity 3600 \
        --subnet-ids subnet-123456 \
        --tags Key=Name,Value=Lustre-TEST-1 \
        --region us-east-2
After successfully creating the file system, Amazon FSx returns the file system description as JSON, as shown in the following example.
```

Working with Server-Side Encrypted Amazon S3 Buckets
Amazon FSx for Lustre supports Amazon S3 buckets that use server-side encryption with S3-managed keys (SSE-S3), and with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS). 
If you want Amazon FSx to encrypt data when writing to your S3 bucket, you need to set the default encryption on your S3 bucket to either SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS. For more information, see  How Do I Enable Default Encryption for an Amazon S3 Bucket? in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide. When writing files to your S3 bucket, Amazon FSx will follow the default encryption policy of your S3 bucket.
By default, Amazon FSx supports S3 buckets encrypted using SSE-S3. If you want to link your Amazon FSx file system to an S3 bucket encrypted using SSE-KMS encryption, you need to add a statement to your customer-managed KMS key policy that allows Amazon FSx to encrypt and decrypt objects in your S3 bucket using your Customer Master Key (CMK).
The following statement allows a specific Amazon FSx file system to encrypt and decrypt objects for a specific S3 bucket, bucket-name.
{
    "Sid": "Allow access through S3 for the FSx SLR to use the KMS CMK on the objects in the given S3 bucket",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::aws_account_id:role/aws-service-role/s3.data-source.lustre.fsx.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForFSxS3Access_fsx_file_system_id"
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "kms:CallerAccount": "aws_account_id",
            "kms:ViaService": "s3.bucket-region.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "StringLike": {
            "kms:EncryptionContext:aws:s3:arn": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/*"
        }
    }
}
The following policy statement allows all Amazon FSx file systems in your account to link to a specific S3 bucket.
{
    "Sid": "Allow access through S3 for the FSx SLR to use the KMS CMK on the objects in the given S3 bucket",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "kms:CallerAccount": "aws_account_id",
            "kms:ViaService": "s3.bucket-region.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "StringLike": {
            "aws:userid": "*:FSx",
            "kms:EncryptionContext:aws:s3:arn": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/*"
        }
    }
}
Viewing a File System's Export Path
You can view a file system's export path using the Amazon FSx for Lustre console, the AWS CLI, and the API.
To View a File System's Export Path (Console)


Open the Amazon FSx console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/.


Choose File system name or File system ID for the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that you want to view the export path for. The file system details page appears for that file system. 


Choose the Data repository tab. The Data repository integration panel appears, showing the import and export paths.



To View a File System's Export Path (CLI)

To determine the export path for your file system, use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/fsx/describe-file-systems.html command.

aws fsx describe-file-systems
Look for the ExportPath property under LustreConfiguration in the response.
