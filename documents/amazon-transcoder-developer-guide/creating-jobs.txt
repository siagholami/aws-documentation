Creating a Job in Elastic Transcoder
You can create a job using the AWS Management Console or using the Elastic Transcoder Create Job API action. The following procedure explains how to create a job by using the console. For information about how to create a job using the API, see Create Job.
You can configure Elastic Transcoder to notify you when the status of a job changes, including when Elastic Transcoder starts and finishes processing a job, and when it encounters a warning or error condition. For more information, see Creating a Pipeline in Elastic Transcoder.
You cannot update a job after you have created it. If you need to change settings in a job, cancel it, create a new job based on the one that you canceled, update the applicable values, and create the new job. 
Note
Before you can create a job, you must create the pipeline (the queue) that will manage the job. For more information about creating a pipeline, see Creating a Pipeline in Elastic Transcoder. In addition, if you want to transcode a file using settings other than those provided in the Elastic Transcoder default presets, you must create a new preset. For more information about creating a preset, see Creating a Preset in Elastic Transcoder.
To create a job using the Elastic Transcoder console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Elastic Transcoder console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/.


In the navigation bar of the Elastic Transcoder console, select the region corresponding to the pipeline that you want to use for the transcoding job. Pipelines are available only in the regions where they were created.


In the navigation (left) pane of the console, click Pipelines. (You create the job in the pipeline—the queue—that you want to use to transcode the file.)


On the Pipelines page, click Create New Job.


Enter the applicable values. For more information about each field, see Settings that You Specify When You Create an Elastic Transcoder Job.


Click Create Job. Jobs start as soon as they are created.
Note
If a job fails with an Access Denied error, we recommend that you run the Test Role API action to determine what is causing the error. For more information, see Test Role.
