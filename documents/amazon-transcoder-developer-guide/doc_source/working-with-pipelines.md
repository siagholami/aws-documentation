Pipelines are queues that manage your transcoding jobs\. When you create a job, you specify the pipeline to which you want to add the job\. Elastic Transcoder starts processing the jobs in a pipeline in the order in which you added them\.

One common configuration is to create two pipelinesâ€”one for standard\-priority jobs, and one for high\-priority jobs\. Most jobs go into the standard\-priority pipeline; you use the high\-priority pipeline only when you need to transcode a file immediately\.

If there are other jobs in a pipeline when you create a job, Elastic Transcoder starts processing the new job when resources are available\. A pipeline can process more than one job simultaneously, and the time required to complete a job varies significantly based on the size of the file you're converting and the job specifications\. As a result, jobs don't necessarily complete in the order in which you create them\.

You can temporarily pause a pipeline so it stops processing jobs\. This is useful if you want to cancel one or more jobs, which you can do only until Elastic Transcoder starts processing the jobs\.
