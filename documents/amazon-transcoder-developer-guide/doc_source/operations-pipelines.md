Pipelines are queues that manage your transcoding jobs\. When you create a job, you specify which pipeline you want to add the job to\. Elastic Transcoder starts processing the jobs in a pipeline in the order in which you added them\.

This section describes operations that you can perform on pipelines using the Elastic Transcoder API\. For more information about pipelines, including how to perform the same operations using the Elastic Transcoder console, see [Working with Pipelines](working-with-pipelines.md)\.
