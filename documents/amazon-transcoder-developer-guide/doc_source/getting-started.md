# Getting Started with Elastic Transcoder<a name="getting-started"></a>

The example in this topic gives you a quick overview of how to use Amazon Elastic Transcoder to transcode media files from one media format into another\. You only need to perform a few basic steps to start transcoding your media files using Elastic Transcoder\. The first step is signing up for AWS\. After that, you create an Amazon S3 bucket and upload a media file that you want to transcode\. You then create a pipeline to process your jobs, and create a job to transcode a specific file into a specific format\. If you want to transcode to a format for which we don't provide a preset \(a template\), you can create a custom preset before you create the job\.

**Note**  
If you aren't already acquainted with jobs, pipelines, and presets—the basic concepts behind Elastic Transcoder—take a quick look at the short overview topic: [What is Amazon Elastic Transcoder?](introduction.md)
