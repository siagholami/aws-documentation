Description
To pause or reactivate a pipeline, so the pipeline stops or restarts processing jobs, update the status for the pipeline. Send a POST request to the /2012-09-25/pipelines/pipelineId/status resource. 
Changing the pipeline status is useful if you want to cancel one or more jobs. You can't cancel jobs after Elastic Transcoder has started processing them; if you pause the pipeline to which you submitted the jobs, you have more time to get the job IDs for the jobs that you want to cancel, and to send a Delete Job request.
