Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch
You can monitor pipelines and operations using CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from Elastic Transcoder into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing. By default, Elastic Transcoder metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch in 1-minute periods. For more information, see What Are Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon CloudWatch Events, and Amazon CloudWatch Logs? in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
