Pausing and Reactivating Pipelines in Elastic Transcoder
If you want to cancel a job, we recommend that you first pause the corresponding pipeline so Elastic Transcoder doesn't start processing the job. After the status of a job changes from Submitted to Progressing, you can't cancel it.
The following procedure explains how to pause and reactivate a pipeline by using the console. For information about how to pause and reactivate a pipeline by using the API, see Update Pipeline Status.
To pause or reactivate a pipeline using the Elastic Transcoder console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Elastic Transcoder console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/.


In the navigation bar of the Elastic Transcoder console, select the region in which you want to pause or reactivate a pipeline.


In the navigation (left) pane, click Pipelines.


Select the check box next to the pipeline that you want to pause or reactivate.


Click Pause or Activate as applicable.
