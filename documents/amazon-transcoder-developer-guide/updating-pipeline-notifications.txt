Updating Pipeline Notifications in Elastic Transcoder
When you create a pipeline, you can optionally configure Elastic Transcoder to send a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the status of a job changes, including when Elastic Transcoder starts or finishes processing a job, and when Elastic Transcoder encounters a warning or error condition while processing a job. You can change whether you want Elastic Transcoder to send a message, and, if so, you can change which SNS topic to send the message to. 
Amazon SNS offers a variety of notification options, including the ability to send Amazon SNS messages to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues. For more information, see the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide.
The following procedure explains how to update notifications using the console. For information about how to update notifications using the API, see Update Pipeline Notifications.
