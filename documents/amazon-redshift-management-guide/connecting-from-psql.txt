Connect to your cluster by using the psql tool
After you create an Amazon Redshift cluster, you can use psql, a terminal-based front end from PostgreSQL, to query the data in your cluster. You can type the queries interactively or read them from a file. To connect from psql, you must specify the cluster endpoint, database, and port.
Note
 Amazon Redshift does not provide the psql tool; it is installed with PostgreSQL. For information about using psql, go to https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/app-psql.html. For information about installing the PostgreSQL client tools, select your operating system from the PostgreSQL binary downloads page at https://www.postgresql.org/download/.
If you have trouble connecting from a Microsoft Windows prompt due to an invalid client_encoding, set the PGCLIENTENCODING environment variable to UTF-8 before running psql.   
set PGCLIENTENCODING=UTF8
Connect by using the psql defaults
By default, psql does not validate the Amazon Redshift service; it makes an encrypted connection by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
To connect by using psql defaults


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.


Choose one of the following steps depending on which Amazon Redshift console you are using:
    (New console) In the navigation pane, choose CLUSTERS. Then choose the cluster name from the list to open its details. On the Properties tab, in the Database configurations section, record the Database name and Port. View the Connection details section and record the Endpoint which is in the following form: 
endpoint:port/databasename
    (Original console) In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. Choose your cluster to open it. Under Cluster Database Properties, record the values of Endpoint, Port, and Database Name.



At a command prompt, specify the connection information by using either command line parameters or a connection information string. To use parameters:


psql -h <endpoint> -U <userid> -d <databasename> -p <port>
Where:


 is the Endpoint you recorded in the previous step.
 is a user ID with permissions to connect to the cluster.
 is the Database Name you recorded in the previous step.
 is the Port you recorded in the previous step.

For example:
psql -h examplecluster.<XXXXXXXXXXXX>.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com -U masteruser -d dev -p 5439

At the psql password prompt, enter the password for the  user.

You are connected to the cluster, and you can interactively enter commands.
Connect by using a certificate
To control whether psql authenticates the service using a certificate, you must use a connection information string to specify connection information, and specify the sslmode keyword. By default, psql operates with sslmode=prefer. To specify that psql opens an encrypted connection and uses an Amazon Redshift certificate to verify the service, download an Amazon Redshift certificate to your computer. Specify verify-full unless you use a DNS alias. If you use a DNS alias, select verify-ca. Specify sslrootcert with the location of the certificate. For more information about sslmode, see Configuring security options for connections. 
For more information about connection information string parameters, see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/libpq-connect.html.
To connect by using a certificate


Save the download the Redshift certificate authority bundle a .crt file to your computer. If you do a File\Save as using Internet Explorer, specify the file type as Text file (*.txt) and delete the .txt extension. For example, save it as the file C:\MyDownloads\redshift-ca-bundle.crt.


Choose one of the following steps depending on which Amazon Redshift console you are using:
    (New console) In the navigation pane, choose CLUSTERS. Then choose the cluster name from the list to open its details. On the Properties tab, in the Database configurations section, record the Database name and Port. View the Connection details section and record the Endpoint which is in the following form: 
endpoint:port/databasename
    (Original console) In the navigation pane, choose Clusters. Choose your cluster to open it. Under Cluster Database Properties, record the values of Endpoint, Port, and Database Name.



At a command prompt, specify the connection information using a connection information string:


psql "host=<endpoint> user=<userid> dbname=<databasename> port=<port> sslmode=verify-ca sslrootcert=<certificate>"
Where:


 is the Endpoint you recorded in the previous step.
 is a user ID with permissions to connect to the cluster.
 is the Database Name you recorded in the previous step.
 is the Port you recorded in the previous step.

 is the full path to the certificate file. On Windows systems, the certificate path must be specified using Linux-style / separators instead of the Windows \ separator.
On Linux and macOS X operating systems, the path is 
~/.postgresql/root.crt
On Microsoft Windows, the path is 
%APPDATA%/postgresql/root.crt


For example:
psql "host=examplecluster.<XXXXXXXXXXXX>.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com user=masteruser dbname=dev port=5439 sslmode=verify-ca sslrootcert=C:/MyDownloads/redshift-ca-bundle.crt"

At the psql password prompt, enter the password for the  user.

You are connected to the cluster, and you can interactively enter commands.
