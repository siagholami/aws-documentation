Possible solutions
Generally, when you receive an error message indicating that there is a failure to establish a connection, it is an issue with permission to access the cluster. 
To connect to the cluster from a client tool outside of the network that the cluster is in, add an ingress rule. Add the rule to the cluster security group for the CIDR/IP that you are connecting from: 
 If you created your Amazon Redshift cluster in a virtual private cloud (VPC) based on Amazon VPC, add your client CIDR/IP address to the VPC security group in Amazon VPC. For more information about configuring VPC security groups for your cluster, see Managing clusters in a VPC .
  If you created your Amazon Redshift cluster outside a VPC, add your client CIDR/IP address to the cluster security group in Amazon Redshift. For more information about configuring cluster security groups, see Amazon Redshift cluster security groups.
If you attempt to connect to the cluster from a client tool in an Amazon EC2 instance, you also add an ingress rule. In this case, add the rule to the cluster security group for the Amazon EC2 security group that is associated with the Amazon EC2 instance. For more information about configuring cluster security groups, see Amazon Redshift cluster security groups. 
In some cases, you might have a layer between your client and server, such as a firewall. In these cases, make sure that the firewall accepts inbound connections over the port that you configured for your cluster.
