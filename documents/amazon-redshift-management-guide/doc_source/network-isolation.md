To route traffic between Amazon Redshift and clients and applications on a corporate network:
+ Set up a private connection between your virtual private cloud \(VPC\) and your corporate network\. Set up either an IPsec VPN connection over the internet or a private physical connection using AWS Direct Connect connection\. AWS Direct Connect enables you to establish a private virtual interface from your on\-premises network directly to your Amazon VPC, providing you with a private, high\-bandwidth network connection between your network and your VPC\. With multiple virtual interfaces, you can even establish private connectivity to multiple VPCs while maintaining network isolation\. For more information, see [What is AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) and [What is AWS Direct Connect?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) 

To route traffic between an Amazon Redshift cluster in a VPC and Amazon S3 buckets in the same AWS Region:
+ Set up an Amazon S3 private VPC endpoint to privately access Amazon S3 data from an ETL load or unload\. For more information, see [Endpoints for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html)\. 
+ Enable “Enhanced VPC routing” for an Amazon Redshift cluster, specifying a target Amazon S3 VPC endpoint\. Traffic generated by Amazon Redshift COPY, UNLOAD, or CREATE LIBRARY commands are then routed through the private endpoint\.
