# What is Amazon Redshift?<a name="welcome"></a>

Welcome to the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*\. Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte\-scale data warehouse service in the cloud\. You can start with just a few hundred gigabytes of data and scale to a petabyte or more\. This enables you to use your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers\.

The first step to create a data warehouse is to launch a set of nodes, called an Amazon Redshift cluster\. After you provision your cluster, you can upload your data set and then perform data analysis queries\. Regardless of the size of the data set, Amazon Redshift offers fast query performance using the same SQL\-based tools and business intelligence applications that you use today\.

 There are several ways to manage clusters\. If you prefer a more interactive way of managing clusters, you can use the Amazon Redshift console or the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. If you are an application developer, you can use the Amazon Redshift Query API or the AWS Software Development Kit \(SDK\) libraries to manage clusters programmatically\. If you use the Amazon Redshift Query API, you must authenticate every HTTP or HTTPS request to the API by signing it\. For more information about signing requests, go to [Signing an HTTP request](amazon-redshift-signing-requests.md)\.
