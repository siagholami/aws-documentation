# Configuration and vulnerability analysis in Amazon Redshift<a name="security-vulnerability-analysis-and-management"></a>

AWS handles basic security tasks like guest operating system \(OS\) and database patching, firewall configuration, and disaster recovery \(DR\)\. These procedures have been reviewed by certified third parties\. For more information, see [Compliance validation for Amazon Redshift](security-compliance.md), the [Shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/), and the [Amazon web services: Overview of security processes](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper\.

Amazon Redshift automatically applies upgrades and patches your data warehouse so you can focus on your application and not on its administration\. Patches and upgrades are applied during a configurable maintenance window\. For more information, see [Maintenance windows](working-with-clusters.md#rs-maintenance-windows)\.
