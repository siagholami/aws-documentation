The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones \(AZs\)\. AWS Regions provide multiple, physically separated and isolated Availability Zones that are connected with low latency, high throughput, and highly redundant networking\. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption\. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single data center infrastructures or multiple data center infrastructures\. 

Almost all AWS Regions have multiple Availability Zones and data centers\. You can deploy your applications across multiple Availability Zones in the same Region for fault tolerance and low latency\. 

For more information on AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see [AWS global infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)\.
