# Enabling enhanced VPC routing<a name="enhanced-vpc-enabling-cluster"></a>

You can enable enhanced VPC routing when you create a cluster, or you can modify an existing cluster to enable enhanced VPC routing\.

To work with enhanced VPC routing, your cluster must meet the following requirements and constraints:
+ Your cluster must be in a VPC\. 

  If you attach an Amazon S3 VPC endpoint, your cluster uses the VPC endpoint only for access to Amazon S3 buckets in the same AWS Region\. To access buckets in another AWS Region \(not using the VPC endpoint\) or to access other AWS services, make your cluster publicly accessible or use a [network address translation \(NAT\) gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html)\. For more information, see [Creating a cluster in a VPC](getting-started-cluster-in-vpc.md)\.
+ You must enable Domain Name Service \(DNS\) resolution in your VPC\. Alternatively, if you're using your own DNS server, make sure that DNS requests to Amazon S3 are resolved correctly to the IP addresses that are maintained by AWS\. For more information, see [Using DNS with Your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide\.*
+ DNS hostnames must be enabled in your VPC\. DNS hostnames are enabled by default\.
+ Your VPC endpoint policies must allow access to any Amazon S3 buckets used with COPY, UNLOAD, or CREATE LIBRARY calls in Amazon Redshift, including access to any manifest files involved\. For COPY from remote hosts, your endpoint policies must allow access to each host machine\. For more information, see [IAM Permissions for COPY, UNLOAD, and CREATE LIBRARY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/copy-usage_notes-access-permissions.html#copy-usage_notes-iam-permissions) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide\.*

**Note**  
A new console is available for Amazon Redshift\. Choose either the **New console** or the **Original console** instructions based on the console that you are using\. The **New console** instructions are open by default\.

**To create a cluster with enhanced VPC routing**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/)\.

1. On the navigation menu, choose **CLUSTERS**, then choose **Create cluster** and enter the **Cluster details** properties\. 

1. To display the **Additional configurations** section, choose to switch off **Use defaults**\. 

1. To enable **Enhanced VPC routing** select **Enabled** to force cluster traffic through the VPC\. 

1. Choose **Create cluster** to create the cluster\. The cluster might take several minutes to be ready to use\.

You can create a cluster with enhanced VPC routing enabled by using the AWS Management Console\. To do so, choose **Yes** for the **Enhanced VPC Routing** option in the Launch Cluster wizardâ€™s **Configure Networking Options** section, as shown following\. For more information, see [Creating a cluster](managing-clusters-console.md#create-cluster)\.

To modify a cluster to enable enhanced VPC routing using the console, choose the cluster\. Then choose **Modify Cluster**, and choose **Yes** for the **Enhanced VPC Routing** option in the **Modify Cluster** dialog box\. For more information, see [Modifying a cluster](managing-clusters-console.md#modify-cluster)\.

**Note**  
When you modify a cluster to enable enhanced VPC routing, the cluster automatically restarts to apply the change\.

You can use the following AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) operations for Amazon Redshift to enable enhanced VPC routing:
+ [create\-cluster ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/redshift/create-cluster.html)
+ [modify\-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/redshift/modify-cluster.html)

 You can use the following Amazon Redshift API actions to enable enhanced VPC routing:
+ [CreateCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCluster.html)
+ [ModifyCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyCluster.html)
