# Managing snapshots using the console<a name="managing-snapshots-console"></a>

Amazon Redshift takes automatic, incremental snapshots of your data periodically and saves them to Amazon S3\. Additionally, you can take manual snapshots of your data whenever you want\. In this section, you can find how to manage your snapshots from the Amazon Redshift console\. For more information about snapshots, see [Amazon Redshift snapshots](working-with-snapshots.md)\.

All snapshot tasks in the Amazon Redshift console start from the snapshot list\. You can filter the list by using a time range, the snapshot type, and the cluster associated with the snapshot\. In addition, you can sort the list by date, size, and snapshot type\.  Depending on the snapshot type that you select, you might have different options available for working with the snapshot\.

## Creating a snapshot schedule<a name="snapshot-schedule-create"></a>

To precisely control when snapshots are taken, you can create a snapshot schedule and attach it to one or more clusters\. You can attach a schedule when you create a cluster or by modifying the cluster\. For more information, see [Automated snapshot schedules](working-with-snapshots.md#automated-snapshot-schedules)\.

**Note**

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/images/restore-from-snapshot-list.png)

1. In the **Restore Cluster from Snapshot** dialog box, do the following:

   1. In the **Cluster Identifier** box, type a cluster identifier for the restored cluster\. 

      Cluster identifiers must meet the following conditions:
      + They must contain from 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens\.
      + Alphabetic characters must be lowercase\.
      + The first character must be a letter\.
      + They cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens\.

      This option only appears if you restore the cluster into the EC2\-VPC platform\.

   1. For **Publicly Accessible**, select **Yes** if you want the cluster to have a public IP address that can be accessed over a public connection to the Internet\. Select **No** if you want the cluster to have a private IP address that can only be accessed from within the VPC\. If your AWS account allows you to create EC2\-Classic clusters, the default is **No**\. Otherwise, the default is **Yes**\. 

      This option only appears if you restore the cluster into the EC2\-VPC platform\.

## Configuring cross\-Region snapshot copy for a nonencrypted cluster<a name="snapshot-crossregioncopy-configure"></a>

You can configure Amazon Redshift to copy snapshots for a cluster to another AWS Region\. To configure cross\-Region snapshot copy, you need to enable this copy feature for each cluster and configure where to copy snapshots and how long to keep copied automated snapshots in the destination AWS Region\. When cross\-Region copy is enabled for a cluster, all new manual and automated snapshots are copied to the specified AWS Region\. Copied snapshot names are prefixed with **copy:**\.

**Note**

1. Choose **Save**\.

## Configure cross\-Region snapshot copy for an AWS KMSâ€“encrypted cluster<a name="xregioncopy-kms-encrypted-snapshot"></a>

 When you launch an Amazon Redshift cluster, you can choose to encrypt it with a master key from the AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\)\. AWS KMS keys are specific to an AWS Region\. If you want to enable cross\-Region snapshot copy for an AWS KMSâ€“encrypted cluster, you must configure a *snapshot copy grant* for a master key in the destination AWS Region\. By doing this, you enable Amazon Redshift to perform encryption operations in the destination AWS Region\.

The following procedure describes the process of enabling cross\-Region snapshot copy for an AWS KMS\-encrypted cluster\. For more information about encryption in Amazon Redshift and snapshot copy grants, see [Copying AWS KMSâ€“encrypted snapshots to another AWS Region](working-with-db-encryption.md#configure-snapshot-copy-grant)\. 

**Note**  
A new console is available for Amazon Redshift\. Choose either the **New console** or the **Original console** instructions based on the console that you are using\. The **New console** instructions are open by default\.

### New console<a name="snapshot-crossregion-encrypt-configure"></a>

**To configure a cross\-Region snapshot for an AWS KMSâ€“encrypted cluster**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/)\.

1. On the navigation menu, choose **CLUSTERS**, then choose the cluster that you want to move snapshots for\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **Configure cross\-region snapshot** to display the configuration page\. 

1. Enter the properties of the new configuration, then **Save**\. 

### Original console<a name="snapshot-crossregion-encrypt-configure-originalconsole"></a><a name="xregioncopy-kms-encrypted-snapshot-task"></a>

**To configure cross\-Region snapshot copy for an AWS KMS\-encrypted cluster**

1. Open the Amazon Redshift console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Clusters**\.

1. In the cluster list, choose a cluster name to open the **Configuration** view for the cluster\.

   1. Choose **Yes** to choose an existing snapshot copy grant from the destination AWS Region\. Then choose a grant from **Snapshot Copy Grant**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

## Modifying the retention period for cross\-Region snapshot copy<a name="snapshot-crossregioncopy-modify"></a>

After you configure cross\-Region snapshot copy, you might want to change the settings\. You can easily change the retention period by selecting a new number of days and saving the changes\. 

**Warning**  
You can't modify the destination AWS Region after cross\-Region snapshot copy is configured\.   
If you want to copy snapshots to a different AWS Region, first disable cross\-Region snapshot copy\. Then re\-enable it with a new destination AWS Region and retention period\. Any copied automated snapshots are deleted after you disable cross\-Region snapshot copy\. Thus, you should determine if there are any that you want to keep and copy them to manual snapshots before disabling cross\-Region snapshot copy\.

**Note**  
A new console is available for Amazon Redshift\. Choose either the **New console** or the **Original console** instructions based on the console that you are using\. The **New console** instructions are open by default\.

If you select a larger number of days to retain snapshots in the destination AWS Region, the retention period for existing automated snapshots is extended\. It lengthens by the difference between the old value and the new value\.

1. Choose **Save Configuration**\.
