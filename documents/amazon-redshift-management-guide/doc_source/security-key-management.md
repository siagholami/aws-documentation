# Key management<a name="security-key-management"></a>

You can configure your environment to protect data with keys:
+ Amazon Redshift automatically integrates with AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) for key management\. AWS KMS uses envelope encryption\. For more information, see [Envelope Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping)\. 
+ When encryption keys are managed in AWS KMS, Amazon Redshift uses a four\-tier, key\-based architecture for encryption\. The architecture consists of randomly generated AES\-256 data encryption keys, a database key, a cluster key, and a master key\. For more information, see [How Amazon Redshift Uses AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/services-redshift.html)\. 
+ You can create your own customer Master Key \(CMK\) in KMS\. For more information, see [Creating Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html)\. 
+ You can also import your own key material for new CMKs\. For more information, see [Importing Key Material in AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html)\. 
+ Amazon Redshift supports management of encryption keys in external hardware security modules \(HSMs\)\. The HSM can be on\-premises or can be AWS CloudHSM\. When you use an HSM, you must use client and server certificates to configure a trusted connection between Amazon Redshift and your HSM\. Amazon Redshift supports only AWS CloudHSM Classic for key management\. For more information, see [Encryption for Amazon Redshift using hardware security modules](working-with-db-encryption.md#working-with-HSM)\. For information about AWS CloudHSM, see [What is AWS CloudHSM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/introduction.html)\. 
+ You can rotate encryption keys for encrypted clusters\.\. For more information, see [Encryption key rotation in Amazon Redshift](working-with-db-encryption.md#working-with-key-rotation)\.
