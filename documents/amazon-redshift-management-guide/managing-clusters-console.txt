One way to learn about creating a cluster is to create a cluster using the console. 
To create a cluster


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.


On the navigation menu, choose CLUSTERS. The clusters for your account in the current AWS Region are listed. A subset of properties of each cluster is displayed in columns in the list. 


Choose Create cluster to create a cluster. 


Follow the instructions on the console page to enter the properties for Cluster configuration. 


Choose one of the following methods to size your cluster:
Note
The following step describes an Amazon Redshift console that is running in an AWS Region that supports RA3 node types. For a list of AWS Regions that support RA3 node types, see Overview of RA3 node types in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide. 
    If your AWS Region supports RA3 node types, choose either Production or Free trial to answer the question What are you planning to use this cluster for? 
 If your organization is eligible, you might be able to create a cluster under the Amazon Redshift free trial program\. To do this, choose **Free trial** to create a configuration with the dc2\.large node type\. For more information about choosing a free trial, see [Amazon Redshift free trial](http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/free-trial/)\.



If you don't know how large to size your cluster, choose Help me choose. Doing this starts a sizing calculator that asks you questions about the size and query characteristics of the data that you plan to store in your data warehouse. 
If you know the required size of your cluster (that is, the node type and number of nodes), choose I'll choose. Then choose the Node type and number of Nodes to size your cluster for the proof of concept.




Follow the instructions on the console page to enter the properties for Cluster details. 
Note
If you are behind a firewall, the database port must be an open port that accepts inbound connections. 


(Optional) Follow the instructions on the console page to enter properties for Cluster permissions. Provide cluster permissions if your cluster needs to access other AWS services for you, for example to load data from Amazon S3. 


Choose Create cluster to create the cluster. The cluster might take several minutes to be ready to use.


Additional configurations
When you create a cluster, you can specify additional properties to customize it. You can find more details about some of these properties in the following list. 
Virtual private cloud (VPC)
Choose a VPC that has a subnet group. After the cluster is created, the subnet group can't be changed. 
Parameter groups
Choose a cluster parameter group to associate with the cluster. If you don't choose one, the cluster uses the default parameter group. 
Encryption
Choose whether you want to encrypt all data within the cluster and its snapshots. If you leave the default setting, None, encryption is not enabled. If you want to enable encryption, choose whether you want to use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) or a hardware security module (HSM), and then configure the related settings. For more information about encryption in Amazon Redshift, see Amazon Redshift database encryption.
 KMS
Choose KMS if you want to enable encryption and use AWS KMS to manage your encryption key. In Master Key, choose (default) aws/redshift to use a default customer master key (CMK) or choose another key from your AWS account.
Note
If you want to use a key from another AWS account, choose Enter a key ARN from Master Key. Then type the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key to use. You must have permission to use the key. For more information about access to keys in AWS KMS, see Controlling access to your keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
For more information about using AWS KMS encryption keys in Amazon Redshift, see Database encryption for Amazon Redshift using AWS KMS.
 HSM
Choose HSM if you want to enable encryption and use a hardware security module (HSM) to manage your encryption key.
If you choose HSM, choose values from HSM Connection and HSM Client Certificate. These values are required for Amazon Redshift and the HSM to form a trusted connection over which the cluster key can be passed. The HSM connection and client certificate must be set up in Amazon Redshift before you launch a cluster. For more information about setting up HSM connections and client certificates, see Encryption for Amazon Redshift using hardware security modules.
Maintenance track
You can choose whether the cluster version used is the Current, Trailing, or sometimes Preview track. 
Monitoring
You can choose whether to create CloudWatch alarms. 
Configure cross-region snapshot
You can choose whether to enable cross-Region snapshots. 
Original console
You can create a cluster in the AWS Management Console in two ways: 
 If you're new to Amazon Redshift or just need a basic cluster, use Quick launch cluster. With this approach, you specify only the node type, number of nodes, user name, password, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to use for access. For more information, see Creating a cluster by using quick launch cluster.
 If you're an existing user or want to customize your cluster, use Launch cluster. For example, use Launch cluster to use a specific virtual private cloud (VPC) or encrypt data in your cluster. For more information, see Creating a cluster by using a launch cluster.
Creating a cluster by using quick launch cluster

In the CloudWatch Alarms section, choose the alarm that you want to edit. 


The default disk space alarm that was created when you launched your cluster is named percentage-disk-space-used-default-<string>. The string is randomly generated by Amazon Redshift. 



In the Edit Alarm window, edit any values that you want to change, such as the percentage or minutes. 



To change the Amazon SNS topic that the alarm is associated with, do one of the following: 
     If you want to choose another existing topic, choose a topic from the Send a notification to list. 
     If you want to create a new topic, choose create topic and specify a new topic name and the email addresses for recipients. 


Choose Save.
