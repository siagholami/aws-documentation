Connecting to an Amazon Redshift cluster using SQL client tools
You can connect to Amazon Redshift clusters from SQL client tools over Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) connections. Amazon Redshift doesn't provide or install any SQL client tools or libraries. To use these tools or libraries to work with data in your clusters, install them on your client computer or Amazon EC2 instance. You can use most SQL client tools that support JDBC or ODBC drivers. 
You can use the following sections to walk through the process of configuring your client computer or Amazon EC2 instance to use a JDBC or ODBC connection. They also discuss related security options for the client connection to the server. Additionally, following you can find information about setting up and connecting from two example third-party SQL client tools, SQL Workbench/J and psql. You can try these tools if you don't have a business intelligence tool to use yet. You can also use this section to learn about connecting to your cluster programmatically. Finally, if you encounter issues when attempting to connect to your cluster, you can review the troubleshooting information in this section to identify possible solutions.
