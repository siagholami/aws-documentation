Viewing query details
You can analyze query details on the Amazon Redshift console. With a query identifier, you can view details of a query. Details can include, for example, the query's completion status, duration, SQL statement and whether it's a user query or one that was rewritten by Amazon Redshift. A user query is a query that is submitted to Amazon Redshift, either from an SQL client or generated by a business intelligence tool. Amazon Redshift might rewrite the query to optimize it, and this can result in multiple rewritten queries. Although the process is done by Amazon Redshift, you see the rewritten queries on the query details page along with the user query. 
Note
A new console is available for Amazon Redshift. Choose either the New console or the Original console instructions based on the console that you are using. The New console instructions are open by default.

To view a query


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/.


On the navigation menu, choose QUERIES, and then choose Queries to display the list of queries for your account. You might need to change settings on this page to find your query. 


Choose the Query identifier in the list to display Query details. 


The Query details page includes Query details and Query plan tabs with metrics about the query. 
Metrics include details about a query such as start time, query ID, status, and duration. Other details include whether a query ran on a main cluster or a concurrency scaling cluster, and if it's a parent or rewritten query.
Original console
You can view details for a particular query by choosing an individual query in the table on the Queries* page to open the *Query ID view. The following list describes the information available for individual queries:
 Query Properties. Displays a summary of information about the query such as the query ID, the database user who ran the query, the duration, and its status. The Executed on property indicates whether the query ran on a main cluster or a concurrency scaling cluster.
 SQL. Displays the query text in a friendly, human-readable format.
 Query Execution Details. Displays information about how the query was processed. This section includes both planned and actual execution data for the query. Query execution details aren't available for queries that ran on a concurrency scaling cluster. For information on using the Query Execution Details section, see Analyzing query execution.
 Cluster Performance During Query Execution. Displays performance metrics from CloudWatch. For information on using the Cluster Performance During Query Execution section, see Viewing cluster performance during query execution.
The Query view looks similar to the following when you open it.
