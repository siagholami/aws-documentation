Step 5: Configure a JDBC or ODBC connection to use IAM credentials
You can configure your SQL client with an Amazon Redshift JDBC or ODBC driver. This driver manages the process of creating database user credentials and establishing a connection between your SQL client and your Amazon Redshift database. 
If you use an identity provider for authentication, specify the name of a credential provider plugin. The Amazon Redshift JDBC and ODBC drivers include plugins for the following SAML-based identity providers: 
 Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 
 PingOne
 Okta
 Microsoft Azure AD
For the steps to set up Microsoft Azure AD as an identity provider, see Setting up JDBC or ODBC single sign-on authentication with Microsoft Azure AD. 
To configure a JDBC connection to use IAM credentials


Download the latest Amazon Redshift JDBC driver from the Configuring a JDBC connection page.
Important
The Amazon Redshift JDBC driver must be version 1.2.7.1003 or later.


Create a JDBC URL with the IAM credentials options in one of the following formats. To use IAM authentication, add iam: to the Amazon Redshift JDBC URL following jdbc:redshift: as shown in the following example.


jdbc:redshift:iam://
Replace region, account-id, and cluster-name with the values for your AWS Region, account, and cluster. The JDBC driver uses your IAM account information and cluster name to retrieve the cluster ID, AWS Region, and port number. To do so, your IAM user or role must have permission to call the redshift:DescribeClusters operation with the specified cluster.
jdbc:redshift:iam://cluster-name:region/dbname
If your IAM user or role doesn't have permission to call the redshift:DescribeClusters operation, include the cluster ID, AWS Region, and port as shown in the following example. The port number is optional. The default port is 5439.
jdbc:redshift:iam://cluster-name:port/dbname

Add JDBC options to provide IAM credentials. You use different combinations of JDBC options to provide IAM credentials. For details, see JDBC and ODBC Options for Creating Database User Credentials.

The following URL specifies AccessKeyID and SecretAccessKey for an IAM user.
jdbc:redshift:iam://examplecluster:us-west-2/dev?AccessKeyID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE&SecretAccessKey=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
The following example specifies a named profile that contains the IAM credentials\.

jdbc:redshift:iam://examplecluster:us-west-2/dev?Profile=user2

Add JDBC options that the JDBC driver uses to call the GetClusterCredentials API operation. Don't include these options if you call the GetClusterCredentials API operation programmatically.

The following example includes the JDBC GetClusterCredentials options.
jdbc:redshift:iam://examplecluster:us-west-2/dev?plugin_name=com.amazon.redshift.plugin.AzureCredentialsProvider&UID=user&PWD=password&idp_tenant=my_tenant&client_secret=my_secret&client_id=my_id
To configure an ODBC connection to use IAM credentials
In the following procedure, you can find steps only to configure IAM authentication. For steps to use standard authentication, using a database user name and password, see Configuring an ODBC connection.


Install and configure the latest Amazon Redshift OBDC driver for your operating system. For more information, see Configuring an ODBC connection page.
Important
The Amazon Redshift ODBC driver must be version 1.3.6.1000 or later.


Follow the steps for your operating system to configure connection settings.


For more information, see one of the following:
    Install and configure the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver on Microsoft Windows
    Configure the ODBC driver on Linux and macOS X operating systems 


On Microsoft Windows operating systems, access the Amazon Redshift ODBC Driver DSN Setup window.


Under Connection Settings, enter the following information:

Data Source Name 
Server (optional) 
Port (optional) 
Database 

If your IAM user or role has permission to call the redshift:DescribeClusters operation, only Data Source Name and Database are required. Amazon Redshift uses ClusterId and Region to get the server and port by calling the DescribeCluster operation. 
If your IAM user or role doesn't have permission to call the redshift:DescribeClusters operation, specify Server and Port. The default port is 5439.


Under Authentication, choose a value for Auth Type.
For each authentication type, enter values as listed following:
AWS Profile
Enter the following information: 
   ClusterID 
   Region 
   Profile name 
Enter the name of a profile in an AWS config file that contains values for the ODBC connection options\. For more information, see [Using a Configuration Profile](options-for-providing-iam-credentials.md#using-configuration-profile)\.

(Optional) Provide details for options that the ODBC driver uses to call the GetClusterCredentials API operation: 
   DbUser
   User AutoCreate
   DbGroups
For more information, see [JDBC and ODBC Options for Creating Database User Credentials](jdbc-and-odbc-options-for-database-credentials.md)\.

IAM Credentials
Enter the following information: 
   ClusterID 
   Region 
   AccessKeyID and SecretAccessKey 
The access key ID and secret access key for the IAM role or IAM user configured for IAM database authentication\.



SessionToken 
SessionToken is required for an IAM role with temporary credentials. For more information, see Temporary Security Credentials. 
Provide details for options that the ODBC driver uses to call the GetClusterCredentials API operation:
       DbUser (required) 
       User AutoCreate (optional)
