# Downloading Reports in AWS Artifact<a name="downloading-documents"></a>

You can download reports from the AWS Artifact console\. When you download a report from AWS Artifact, the report is generated specifically for you, and every report has a unique watermark\. For this reason, you should share the reports only with those you trust\. Don't email the reports as attachments, and don't share them online\. To share a report, use a secure sharing service such as Amazon WorkDocs\. Some reports require you to sign a nondisclosure agreement \(NDA\) before you can download them\.

To download a report, you must have the appropriate permissions\. For more information about permissions, see [Controlling Access](getting-started.md)\.<a name="download-a-document"></a>

**To download a document**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Artifact console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/artifact/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/artifact/)\.

1. On the **AWS Artifact** dashboard, choose **Reports**\.

1. Locate the report, and then choose **Get this artifact**\.

1. Read the **Terms and conditions** for the document\. You might be asked to sign a nondisclosure agreement \(NDA\) to download the document\.
**Note**  
The NDA is a legally binding contract\. We recommend that you read it closely\.

1. After you have read the **Terms and Conditions**, select the check box at the bottom of the page and then choose **Accept and download**\. AWS Artifact generates your file and opens it in another window\.

1. In the document window choose **Save File** or **Open with** **Adobe Acrobat Reader**, and then choose **OK**\. Your document is downloaded to the specified location on your computer or opened in Adobe Reader\.
