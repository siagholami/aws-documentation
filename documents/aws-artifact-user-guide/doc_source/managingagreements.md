# Managing Your Agreements in AWS Artifact<a name="managingagreements"></a>

AWS Artifact Agreements enable you to use the AWS Management Console to review, accept, and manage agreements for your account or organization\. For example, a Business Associate Addendum \(BAA\) agreement typically is required for companies that are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \(HIPAA\) to ensure that protected health information \(PHI\) is appropriately safeguarded\. You can use AWS Artifact to accept an agreement such as the BAA with AWS, and designate an AWS account that can legally process PHI\. If you use AWS Organizations, you can accept agreements such as the AWS BAA on behalf of all accounts in your organization\. All existing and subsequent member accounts are automatically covered by the agreement and can legally process PHI\.

You can also use AWS Artifact to confirm that your AWS account or organization accepted an agreement and to review the terms of the accepted agreement to understand your obligations\. If your account or organization no longer needs to use the accepted agreement, you can use AWS Artifact Agreements to terminate the agreement\. If you terminate the agreement but later realize that you want to use it, you can activate it again\.
