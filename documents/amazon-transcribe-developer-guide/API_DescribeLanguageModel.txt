DescribeLanguageModel
Gets information about a single custom language model. Use this information to see details about the language model in your AWS account. You can also see whether the base language model used to create your custom language model has been updated. If Amazon Transcribe has updated the base model, you can create a new custom language model using the updated base model. If the language model wasn't created, you can use this operation to understand why Amazon Transcribe couldn't create it.
