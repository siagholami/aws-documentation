Key Management
Amazon Transcribe works with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to provide enhanced encryption for your data. Amazon S3 already enables you to encrypt your input audio when creating a transcription job. Integration with KMS enables you to encrypt the output of the StartTranscriptionJob operation. 
If you don't specify an encryption key, the output of the transcription job is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).
KMS Encryption with the AWS Console
To encrypt the output of your transcription job, you can choose between using an encryption key for the account that is making the request, or you can use an encryption key from another account.
If you don't specify an encryption key, the output of the transcription job is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).
To enable output result encryption


Under Output data choose Encryption.



Choose whether the KMS customer-managed key (CMK) is from the account you're currently using or from a different account. If you want to use a key from the current account, choose the key from KMS key ID. If you're using a key from a different account, you need to enter the key's ARN. To use a key from a different account, the caller must have kms:Encrypt permissions for the KMS key.


KMS Encryption with the API
To use output encryption with the API, you set the OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId parameter of the StartTranscriptionJob operation. You can use an encryption key from the current account, or you can use a key from another account. The account that you are using to create the job must have kms:Encrypt permissions for the KMS key.
You can use either of the following to identify a KMS key in the current account:
 KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
 KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"
You can use either of the following to identify a KMS key in the current account or another account:
 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key: "arn:aws:kms:region:account ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
 ARN of a KMS Key Alias: "arn:aws:kms:region:account ID:alias/ExampleAlias"
