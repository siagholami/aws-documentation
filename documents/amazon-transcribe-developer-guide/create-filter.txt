Step 2: Creating a Vocabulary Filter
You can create a vocabulary filter with either the CreateVocabularyFilter operation or the Amazon Transcribe console.
If you use the CreateVocabularyFilter operation, you can enter the words in your vocabulary filter as an array of strings into the Words parameter. Although this method is more convenient, if you create a text file, you can edit your word list later and reuse it in another vocabulary filter. 
Console
Creating a Vocabulary Filter (Console)
To use the console to create a vocabulary filter, you must have a plain text file that contains the words that you want to filter, formatted as described in Step 1: Creating a List of Unwanted Words . Your file can be saved locally or in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 
To create a vocabulary filter (console)


Sign in to AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Transcribe console at Amazon Transcribe console.


In the navigation pane, choose Vocabulary filtering.


Choose Create vocabulary filter.


For Name, enter a vocabulary filter name that is unique within your AWS account.


For Language, choose the language code for the language of your vocabulary filter. 


For Vocabulary input source, choose one of the following:
    If you saved the file that contains the word that you want to filter locally, choose File upload, then choose Choose file and choose the file. 
    If you saved the file in Amazon S3, for S3 location, enter the URI of the text file or choose Browse S3 and browse to the file and choose it.


Choose Create vocabulary filter.


API
To create a vocabulary filter (API)
 In the CreateVocabularyFilter operation, specify the following:


A name for your vocabulary filter that is unique in your AWS account for the VocabularyFilterName parameter


The language code for the language of your source audio in the LanguageCode parameter


The words for your vocabulary filter using one of the following options:

Specify the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location of the text file in the VocabularyFilterFileUri parameter using this format: s3://AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1/vocabulary-filter-example.txt.
Enter the words as an array of strings in the Words parameter, for example ["word", "banana", "potato", "chair"].



To see all of the vocabulary filters that you've created, use the ListVocabularyFilters operation. You can then use that information with the GetVocabularyFilter operation to retrieve the download URI for your vocabulary filter and learn more about that filter.
AWS CLI
The following is an example AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) request to create a vocabulary filter with a text file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The commands are followed by the response elements in JSON format.
```
aws transcribe create-vocabulary-filter \ 
    --vocabulary-filter-name your-filter-name  \ 
    --language-code en-US \ 
    --vocabulary-filter-file-uri s3://AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1/vocabulary-filter-example.txt
{                
    "VocabularyFilterName": "your-filter-name",
    "LanguageCode": "en-US"
}
```
