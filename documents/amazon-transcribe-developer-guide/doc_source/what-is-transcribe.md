To use Amazon Transcribe you store your audio file in an Amazon S3 bucket\. The output from the transcription job is also stored in an S3 bucket\. Content delivered to Amazon S3 buckets might contain customer content\. For more information about removing sensitive data, see [How Do I Empty an S3 Bucket?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/empty-bucket.html) or [How Do I Delete an S3 Bucket?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/delete-bucket.html)\.

## Recognizing Voices<a name="what-speaker-recognition"></a>

Amazon Transcribe can identify the individual speakers in an audio clip, a technique known as *diarization* or *speaker identification*\. When you activate speaker identification, Amazon Transcribe includes an attribute that identifies each speaker in the audio clip\. You can use speaker identification to:
+ identify the customer and the support representative in a recorded customer support call
+ identify characters for closed captions
+ identify the speaker and questioners in a recorded press conference or lecture

You can specify the number of voices that you want Amazon Transcribe to recognize in an audio clip\.

## Transcribing Separate Audio Channels<a name="what-channel-id"></a>

To create a transcript for each channel, or single stream of recorded sound, in an audio file, use *channel identification*\. With channel identification, Amazon Transcribe returns two or more transcriptions: a combined transcription of all of the audio channels and a transcription of each audio channel\.

Use channel identification when your audio is on multiple channels\. For example, use channel identification:
+ When your recording has a customer service representative on one channel and a customer on another
+ When you transcribe a podcast where the host is recorded on one channel and the guest on another

For more information about channel identification, see [Channel Identification](how-channel-id.md)\.

## Transcribing Streaming Audio<a name="what-streaming-transcription"></a>

You can use Amazon Transcribe to transcribe streaming audio in real\-time\. You send Amazon Transcribe a stream of audio and Amazon Transcribe returns a stream of JSON objects containing the transcription of the audio\.

For more information about processing audio streams, see [Streaming Transcription](streaming.md)\.

## Custom Vocabulary<a name="what-custom-vocabulary"></a>

Create a custom vocabulary to help Amazon Transcribe recognize words that are specific to your use case and improve its accuracy in converting speech to text\. For example, you might create a custom vocabulary that includes industry\-specific words and phrases\. 

Use a custom vocabulary to help Amazon Transcribe recognize:
+ words that are not being recognized
+ unfamiliar words that are specific to your domain

For more information about creating a custom vocabulary, see [Custom Vocabularies](how-vocabulary.md)\.
