# Transcribing Numbers<a name="how-numbers"></a>

When you are transcribing US English, Australian English, British English, or Indian English audio using the [StartTranscriptionJob](API_StartTranscriptionJob.md) operation, numbers are transcribed as digits instead of words\. For streaming transcription, numbers are transcribed as digits for US English and British English only\. For example, the spoken number "one thousand two hundred forty\-two" is transcribed as 1242\. 

In all other languages numbers are transcribed into their word forms\.

Numbers are transcribed according to the following rules:
