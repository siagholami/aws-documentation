Request Parameters
For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see Common Parameters.
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 LanguageCode  
The language code for the language spoken in the input media file. US English (en-US) is the valid value for medical transcription jobs. Any other value you enter for language code results in a BadRequestException error.
Type: String
Valid Values:af-ZA | ar-AE | ar-SA | cy-GB | da-DK | de-CH | de-DE | en-AB | en-AU | en-GB | en-IE | en-IN | en-US | en-WL | es-ES | es-US | fa-IR | fr-CA | fr-FR | ga-IE | gd-GB | he-IL | hi-IN | id-ID | it-IT | ja-JP | ko-KR | ms-MY | nl-NL | pt-BR | pt-PT | ru-RU | ta-IN | te-IN | tr-TR | zh-CN 
Required: Yes
 Media  
Describes the input media file in a transcription request.
Type: Media object
Required: Yes
 MediaFormat  
The audio format of the input media file.
Type: String
Valid Values:mp3 | mp4 | wav | flac 
Required: No
 MediaSampleRateHertz  
The sample rate, in Hertz, of the audio track in the input media file.
If you do not specify the media sample rate, Amazon Transcribe Medical determines the sample rate. If you specify the sample rate, it must match the rate detected by Amazon Transcribe Medical. In most cases, you should leave the MediaSampleRateHertz field blank and let Amazon Transcribe Medical determine the sample rate.
Type: Integer
Valid Range: Minimum value of 8000. Maximum value of 48000.
Required: No
 MedicalTranscriptionJobName  
The name of the medical transcription job. You can't use the strings "." or ".." by themselves as the job name. The name must also be unique within an AWS account. If you try to create a medical transcription job with the same name as a previous medical transcription job, you get a ConflictException error.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 200.
Pattern: ^[0-9a-zA-Z._-] 
Required: Yes
 OutputBucketName  
The Amazon S3 location where the transcription is stored.
You must set OutputBucketName for Amazon Transcribe Medical to store the transcription results. Your transcript appears in the S3 location you specify. When you call the GetMedicalTranscriptionJob, the operation returns this location in the TranscriptFileUri field. The S3 bucket must have permissions that allow Amazon Transcribe Medical to put files in the bucket. For more information, see Permissions Required for IAM User Roles.
You can specify an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt the output of your transcription using the OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId parameter. If you don't specify a KMS key, Amazon Transcribe Medical uses the default Amazon S3 key for server-side encryption of transcripts that are placed in your S3 bucket.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 64.
Pattern: [a-z0-9][\.\-a-z0-9]{1,61}[a-z0-9] 
Required: Yes
 OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key used to encrypt the output of the transcription job. The user calling the StartMedicalTranscriptionJob operation must have permission to use the specified KMS key.
You use either of the following to identify a KMS key in the current account:
 KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
 KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"
You can use either of the following to identify a KMS key in the current account or another account:
 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key in the current account or another account: "arn:aws:kms:region:account ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
 ARN of a KMS Key Alias: "arn:aws:kms:region:account ID:alias/ExampleAlias"
If you don't specify an encryption key, the output of the medical transcription job is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).
If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also specify an output location in the OutputBucketName parameter.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.
Pattern: ^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9:_/=,@.-]{0,2048}$ 
Required: No
 Settings  
Optional settings for the medical transcription job.
Type: MedicalTranscriptionSetting object
Required: No
 Specialty  
The medical specialty of any clinician speaking in the input media.
Type: String
Valid Values:PRIMARYCARE 
Required: Yes
 Type  
The type of speech in the input audio. CONVERSATION refers to conversations between two or more speakers, e.g., a conversations between doctors and patients. DICTATION refers to single-speaker dictated speech, e.g., for clinical notes.
Type: String
Valid Values:CONVERSATION | DICTATION 
Required: Yes
