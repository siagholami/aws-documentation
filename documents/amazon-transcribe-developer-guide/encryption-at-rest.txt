Encryption at Rest
Amazon Transcribe uses the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3) for server-side encryption of transcripts placed in your S3 bucket.
When you use the StartTranscriptionJob operation, you can specify your own AWS Key Management Service key to encrypt the output from a transcription job.
Amazon Transcribe uses an Amazon EBS volume encrypted with the default key.
