Working with Amazon Inspector agents on Linux-based operating systems
You can install, remove, verify, and modify the behavior of Amazon Inspector agents. Sign in to your Amazon EC2 instance running a Linux-based operating system, and run any of the following procedures. For more information about the operating systems that are supported for Amazon Inspector, see Amazon Inspector supported operating systems and Regions.
Important
The Amazon Inspector agent relies on Amazon EC2 instance metadata to function correctly. It accesses instance metadata using version 1 or version 2 of the Instance Metadata Service (IMDSv1 or IMDSv2). See Instance Metadata and User Data to learn more about EC2 instance metadata and access methods.
Note
The commands in this section function in all AWS Regions that are supported by Amazon Inspector.

Verifying that the Amazon Inspector agent is running

To verify that the agent is installed and running, sign in to your EC2 instance and run the following command:

sudo /opt/aws/awsagent/bin/awsagent status
This command returns the status of the currently running agent, or an error stating that the agent cannot be contacted.
Stopping the Amazon Inspector agent

To stop the agent, run the following command:

sudo /etc/init.d/awsagent stop
Starting the Amazon Inspector agent

To start the agent, run the following command:

sudo /etc/init.d/awsagent start
Modifying Amazon Inspector agents settings
After the Amazon Inspector agent is installed and running on your EC2 instance, you can modify the settings in the agent.cfg file to alter the agent's behavior. On Linux-based operating systems, the agent.cfg file is located in the /opt/aws/awsagent/etc directory. After you modify and save the agent.cfg file, you must stop and start the agent for the changes to take effect.
Important
We highly recommend that you modify the agent.cfg file only with the guidance of AWS Support.
Configuring proxy support for an Amazon Inspector agent
To get proxy support for an agent on a Linux-based operating system, use an agent-specific configuration file with specific environment variables. For more information, see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/proxy_settings.
Complete one of the following procedures:
To install an agent on an EC2 instance that uses a proxy server


Create a file called awsagent.env and save it in the /etc/init.d/ directory.


Edit awsagent.env to include these environment variables in the following format:
    export https_proxy=hostname:port
    export http_proxy=hostname:port
    export no_proxy=169.254.169.254
Note
Substitute values in the preceding examples with valid hostname and port number combinations only. Specify the IP address of the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254) for the no_proxy variable. 


Install the Amazon Inspector agent by completing the steps in the Installing the agent on a Linux-based EC2 instance procedure.


To configure proxy support on an EC2 instance with a running agent


To configure proxy support, the version of the agent that is running on your EC2 instance must be 1.0.800.1 or later. If you enabled the auto-update process for the agent, you can verify that your agent's version is 1.0.800.1 or later by using the Verifying that the Amazon Inspector agent is running procedure. If you didn't enable the auto-update process for the agent, you must install the agent on this EC2 instance again by following the Installing the agent on a Linux-based EC2 instance procedure.


Create a file called awsagent.env, and save it in the /etc/init.d/ directory.


Edit awsagent.env to include these environment variables in the following format:
    export https_proxy=hostname:port
    export http_proxy=hostname:port
    export no_proxy=169.254.169.254
Note
Substitute values in the preceding examples with valid hostname and port number combinations only. Specify the IP address of the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254) for the no_proxy variable. 


Restart the agent by first stopping it using the following command:


sudo /etc/init.d/awsagent restart
Proxy settings are picked up and used by both the agent and the auto-update process.
Uninstalling the Amazon Inspector agent
To uninstall the agent


Sign in to your EC2 instance running a Linux-based operating system where you want to uninstall the agent.
Note
For more information about the operating systems that are supported for Amazon Inspector, see Amazon Inspector supported operating systems and Regions.


To uninstall the agent, use one of the following commands:
    On Amazon Linux, CentOS, and Red Hat, run the following command:
sudo yum remove 'AwsAgent*'
    On Ubuntu Server, run the following command:
sudo apt-get purge 'awsagent*'
