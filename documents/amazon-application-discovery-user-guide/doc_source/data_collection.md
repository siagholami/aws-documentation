# Data Collection Tools<a name="data_collection"></a>

The Discovery Connector and Discovery Agent are the data collection tools that Application Discovery Service uses to help you discover your existing infrastructure\. You can download and deploy discovery connectors and discovery agents as explained in [AWS Agentless Discovery Connector](discovery-connector.md) and [ AWS Application Discovery Agent](discovery-agent.md)\.

These data collection tools store their data in the Application Discovery Service's repository, providing details about each server and the processes running on them\. When either of these tools is deployed, you can start, stop, and view the collected data from the Migration Hub console\.
