Data Collected by the Discovery Agent
Following, you can find an inventory of the information collected by the Discovery Agent.
Table legend for Discovery Agent collected data:
 The term host refers to either a physical server or a VM.
 Collected data is in measurements of kilobytes (KB) unless stated otherwise.
 Equivalent data in the Migration Hub console is reported in megabytes (MB).
 Data fields denoted with an asterisk (*) are only available in the .csv files produced from the agent's API export function.
 The polling period is in intervals of approximately 15 minutes.
