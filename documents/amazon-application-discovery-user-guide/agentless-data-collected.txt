Data Collected by the Discovery Connector
The Discovery Connector collects information about your VMware vCenter Server hosts and VMs. However, you can capture this data only if VMware vCenter Server tools are installed. To make sure the AWS account you are using has the required permission for this task, see AWS Managed (Predefined) Policies for Application Discovery Service. 
Following, you can find an inventory of the information collected by the Discovery Connector.
Table legend for Discovery Connector collected data:
 Collected data is in measurements of kilobytes (KB) unless stated otherwise.
 Equivalent data in the Migration Hub console is reported in megabytes (MB).
 Data fields denoted with an asterisk (*) are only available in the .csv files produced from the connector's API export function.
 The polling period is in intervals of approximately 60 minutes.
 Data fields denoted with a double asterisk (**) currently return a null value.
