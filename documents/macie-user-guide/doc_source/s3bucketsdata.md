## Analyzing S3 Buckets Properties Search Results<a name="s3bucketssearchresults"></a>

The following section describes the elements of the search results that appear when you use the **Research** tab to investigate your S3 bucket properties data that Macie monitors\.

Complete the following steps in the **Research** tab\.

1. Select **S3 bucket properties** in the first filter dropdown\.

1. For this example, select **Top 10** in the second filter dropdown\.

1. For this example, select **Past 90** days in the third filter dropdown\.

1. Choose the button with the looking glass icon to start the search\.

Your search results contain the following elements:
+ The **total number of results** that matched your S3 bucket properties data search for the selected time range\.
+ The **graphical representation** of the S3 bucket properties data search results for the selected time range\.
**Note**  
If your dataset is very large and you specify a very wide time range, your data might not render properly, and this graph might not appear as one of the resulting elements of your search\.
**Important**  
You can use the graph to further narrow your search and generate and run a query that produces a subset of the results generated by your original selections in the preceding steps\. Double\-click any of the graph's results, and your selection is translated into a new query that automatically appears in the query parser, and the **Research** tab is refreshed with the results of this new query\. 
+ **Search results summary** – A list of the most significant fields from your search\. The first line includes the top \(or bottom\) three values for each field\. The second line includes the top \(or bottom\) 10 values for each field\.
**Important**  
You can use the fields in the search results summary to further narrow your search and generate and run a query that produces a subset of the results generated by your original selections in the preceding steps\. Choose the first or the second line of results for any field, and in the expanded results breakdown, choose the looking glass icon next to any of the results\. Your choices are translated into a new query that automatically appears in the query parser, and the **Research** tab is refreshed with the results of this new query\.
+ A list of S3 buckets that match your search criteria\. Choose any bucket to expand it and view its details\.

## S3 Bucket Properties Data Fields and Example Queries<a name="s3bucketsfields"></a>

The following tables include the fields that can appear in the results of your S3 buckets metadata searches: 
+ The first table includes the fields that Macie extracts from the Amazon S3 bucket API metadata\. For example, `acl.Grants.Grantee.DisplayName` in Macie corresponds to `Grants.Grantee.DisplayName` in the Amazon S3 `getbucket-acl` API response\.
+ The second table includes the fields that Macie generates to provide further security intelligence and context based on the examined S3 buckets metadata\. For example, `s3_world_readability` describes a true/false/unknown state condition of whether an S3 bucket is readable by everyone as part of evaluating its Amazon S3 ACL and bucket \(IAM\) policy\.
