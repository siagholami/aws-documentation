Analyzing S3 Objects Search Results
The following section describes the elements of the search results that get displayed when you use the Research tab to investigate your S3 objects that Macie monitors. 
Complete the following steps in the Research tab.


Select S3 objects in the first filter pull-down list.


For this sample procedure, select Top 10 in the second filter dropdown.


For this sample procedure, select Past 90 days in the third filter dropdown.


Choose the button with the looking glass icon to start the search.


Your search results include the following elements:
 The total number of results that matched your S3 objects search for the selected time range.
 The graphical representation of the S3 objects search results for the selected time range.
Note
If your dataset is very large and you specify a very wide time range, your data might not render properly, and this graph might not appear as one of the resulting elements of your search.
Important
You can use the graph to further narrow your search and generate and run a query that produces a subset of the results generated by your original selections in the preceding steps. Double-click any of the graph's results, and your selection is translated into a new query that automatically appears in the query parser, and the Research tab is refreshed with the results of this new query. 
 Search results summary â€“ A list of the most significant fields from your search. The first line includes the top (or bottom) three values for each field. The second line includes the top (or bottom) 10 values for each field.
Important
You can use the fields in the search results summary to further narrow your search and generate and run a query that produces a subset of the results generated by your original selections in the preceding steps. Choose the first or the second line of results for any field, and in the expanded results breakdown, choose the looking glass icon next to any of the results. Your choices are translated into a new query that automatically appears in the query parser, and the Research tab is refreshed with the results of this new query.
 A list of S3 objects that match your search criteria. Choose any S3 object to expand it and view its details.
S3 Objects Data Fields and Sample Queries
The following tables include the fields that can appear in the results of your S3 object searches:
 The first table includes the fields that Macie extracts from the Amazon S3 object API metadata. These are Macie fields that are also found in S3 API metadata. For example, filesystem_metadata.ETag describes the entity tag of an S3 object based on the checksum or hash of its content.
 The second table includes the fields that Macie generates to provide further security intelligence and context based on the examined S3 objects content and metadata. For example, dlp_risk represents a weighted score describing the risk profile of an S3 object metadata and its content, and pii_types describes any personal identifiable information contained in an S3 object.
