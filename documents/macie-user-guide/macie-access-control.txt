Controlling Access to Amazon Macie
AWS uses security credentials to identify you and to grant you access to your AWS resources. You can use features of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to allow other users, services, and applications to use your AWS resources fully or in a limited way. You can do this without sharing your security credentials.
By default, IAM users don't have permission to create, view, or modify AWS resources. To allow an IAM user to access resources such as a load balancer, and to perform tasks, you:


Create an IAM policy that grants the IAM user permission to use the specific resources and API actions they need.


Attach the policy to the IAM user or the group that the IAM user belongs to.


When you attach a policy to a user or group of users, it allows or denies the users permission to perform the specified tasks on the specified resources.
For example, you can use IAM to create users and groups under your AWS account. An IAM user can be a person, a system, or an application. Then you grant permissions to the users and groups to perform specific actions on the specified resources using an IAM policy.
For more information, see the IAM User Guide.
Granting Administrator Access to Macie
The master account users have access to the Macie console, where they can configure Macie and use it to monitor and protect the resources in both master and member accounts. For more information about master and member accounts, see Concepts and Terminology and Integrating Member Accounts and Amazon S3 with Amazon Macie. 
For the master account users to be able to use the Macie console, they must be granted the required permissions. To ensure this, use the following policy document to create and attach an IAM policy to any user identity type that belongs to your master Macie account. This policy grants master account users permissions to use the Macie console in its full capacity.
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": "*",
         "Action":[
            "macie:*"
         ]
      },
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
         "Resource": "*",
         "Condition": {
            "StringLike": {
               "iam:AWSServiceName": "macie.amazonaws.com"
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}
Granting Read-Only Access to Macie
For a user to view any data in the Macie console, they must be granted the required permissions. To grant read-only access, create a custom policy using the following policy document and attach it to a IAM user, group, or role. This policy grants users permissions to only view information in the Macie console.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "macie:Get*",
                "macie:List*",
                "macie:Describe*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
Predefined AWS Managed Policies for Macie
The managed policies created by AWS grant the required permissions for common use cases. You can attach these policies to IAM users in your AWS account, based on the access to Macie that they require:
 AmazonMacieFullAccess – Grants full access to Macie
 AmazonMacieHandshakeRole – Grants permission to create the service-linked role for Macie
The following are legacy policies that have been replaced by a service-linked role. For more information, see Legacy Roles for Macie.
 AmazonMacieServiceRole – Grants Macie read-only access to resource dependencies in your account in order to enable data analysis
 AmazonMacieSetupRole – Grants Macie access to your AWS account
Creating a Handshake Role
You can create a role that grants the permissions in the AmazonMacieHandshakeRole policy to Macie from the master account as follows.
To create AWSMacieServiceCustomerHandshakeRole using the IAM console


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles.


Choose Create role and do the following:


For Select type of trusted entity, choose AWS service.


For Choose a use case, select EC2.


Choose Next: Permissions.


On the Attach permissions policies page, select the checkbox for the AmazonMacieHandshakeRole policy and choose Next: Tags.


(Optional) Add tags to your role and then choose Next: Review.


On the Review page, do the following:


For Role name, enter AWSMacieServiceCustomerHandshakeRole.


For Role description, enter the following: Allows the master account to create service-linked roles in the member accounts.


Choose Create role.


Edit the trust policy as follows:


Select AWSMacieServiceCustomerHandshakeRole, which you just created.


On the Trust relationships tab, choose Edit trust relationship.


Enter the following trust policy:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": { 
          "Service": "macie.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "sts:ExternalId": "master-account-id"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }


Choose Update Trust Policy.


To create AWSMacieServiceCustomerHandshakeRole using the AWS CLI

Create the following trust policy and save it in a text file named macie-handshake-trust-policy.json.

{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": { 
           "Service": "macie.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
           "StringEquals": {
             "sts:ExternalId": "master-account-id"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }

Create the role and specify the trust policy that you created in the previous step using the create-role command.

aws iam create-role --role-name AWSMacieServiceCustomerHandshakeRole --assume-role-policy-document file://macie-handshake-trust-policy.json

Attach the AmazonMacieHandshakeRole policy to the role using the attach-role-policy command.

aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name AWSMacieServiceCustomerHandshakeRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonMacieHandshakeRole
