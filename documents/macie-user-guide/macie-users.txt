Analyzing Amazon Macie–Monitored Data by User Activity
The Users tab can help you draw a comprehensive picture of all of the data and activity monitored by Macie for a particular selected user. This topic describes how to search for the users whose activity you want to investigate further in the Users tab. It also describes the views that you can use in this tab to see the selected users' monitored data grouped by various interest points. Each view provides you with one or more ways of navigating to the Macie console's Research tab. There you can construct and run queries in the query parser and conduct in-depth investigative research of the data and activity monitored by Macie for the selected users.

MacieUniqueID
In the context of Macie, a user is the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity that makes a particular request. Macie uses the AWS CloudTrail userIdentity element to distinguish the following user types. For more information, see CloudTrail userIdentity Element. 
 Root – The request was made with your AWS account credentials.
 IAM user – The request was made with the credentials of an IAM user. 
 Assumed role – The request was made with temporary security credentials that were obtained with a role via a call to the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) AssumeRole API operation. 
 Federated user – The request was made with temporary security credentials that were obtained via a call to the AWS STS GetFederationToken API operation.
 AWS account – The request was made by another account. 
 AWS service – The request was made by an account that belongs to an AWS service. 
When specifying a user in the Macie console, you must use a special Macie format called macieUniqueId. Examples of specifying a user include searching for a user in the Users tab, constructing a query in the Research tab, and whitelisting a user in a basic alert with the index of CloudTrail data. The macieUniqueId is a combination of the IAM UserIdentity element and the recipientAccountId. For more information, see CloudTrail userIdentity Element and the definition of recipientAccountId in CloudTrail Record Contents. 
The following examples list various structures of macieUniqueId, depending on the user identity type.

User Categories in Macie
Based on their activity (API calls), users in Macie are grouped into the following categories:
 Platinum – These IAM users or roles have a history of making high-risk API calls indicative of an administrator or root user, such as creating users, authorizing security group ingress, or updating policies. These accounts should be monitored closely for signs of account compromise. 
 Gold – These IAM users or roles have a history of making infrastructure-related API calls indicative of a power user, such as running instances or writing data to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). These accounts should be monitored closely for signs of account compromise. 
 Silver – These IAM users or roles have a history of issuing high quantities of medium-risk API calls, such as Describe* and List* operations, or read-only access requests to Amazon S3.
 Bronze – These IAM users or roles typically execute lower quantities of Describe* and List* API calls in the AWS environment.
Investigating Users
Follow this procedure to generate a comprehensive picture of all of the data and activity monitored by Macie for the specified user.


In the Macie console's Users tab, specify a user name in the Search field and press Enter.
Note
When specifying a user, you must use a special Macie format called macieUniqueId: for example, 123456789012:root, 123456789012:user/Bob, or 123456789012:assumed-role/Accounting-Role/Mary, depending on the identity type of the user that you want to whitelist. For more information, see the definition of user in Concepts and Terminology.


When the user data is generated, choose the corresponding icon to select any of the following views to display various subsets of this user's data and activity that Macie monitors:
    High-risk CloudTrail events
    High-risk CloudTrail errors
    Activity location
    CloudTrail events
    Activity ISPs
    CloudTrail user identity types


If present in the selected view, locate and move the Minimum risk slider to the desired value. The Minimum risk slider enables you to view only items with the assigned risk equal to and greater than the selected value. 


High-Risk CloudTrail Events
This view provides a visual representation of the top 20 (by assigned risk and based on the value selected on the Minimum risk slider) CloudTrail data and management events that occurred during the last 60 days for the selected user.
