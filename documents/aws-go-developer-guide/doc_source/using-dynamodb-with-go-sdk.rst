|DDBlong| Examples Using the |sdk-go|

   :description: Use DynamoDB code examples to write your own Go applications.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Go examples, DynamoDB

|DDBlong| is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with
seamless scalability. The |sdk-go| examples can integrate |DDBlong| into your Go applications.
The examples assume you have already set up and configured the SDK (that
is, you have imported all required packages and set your credentials and region). For more information, see :doc:`setting-up` and :doc:`configuring-sdk`.

The topic also provides a link to a downloadable version of |DDB|, which includes an interactive web
interface so you can experiment with |DDB| offline.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the :doc-examples-go:`aws-doc-sdk-examples <dynamodb>` repository on GitHub.
