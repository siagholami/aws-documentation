Creating App Mesh resources with AWS CloudFormation
App Mesh is integrated with AWS CloudFormation, a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time creating and managing your resources and infrastructure. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want, for example an App Mesh mesh, and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. 
When you use AWS CloudFormation, you can reuse your template to set up your App Mesh resources consistently and repeatedly. Just describe your resources once, and then provision the same resources over and over in multiple AWS accounts and Regions.
App Mesh and AWS CloudFormation templates
To provision and configure resources for App Mesh and related services, you must understand AWS CloudFormation templates. Templates are formatted text files in JSON or YAML. These templates describe the resources that you want to provision in your AWS CloudFormation stacks. If you're unfamiliar with JSON or YAML, you can use AWS CloudFormation Designer to help you get started with AWS CloudFormation templates. For more information, see What is AWS CloudFormation Designer? in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
App Mesh supports creating meshes, routes, virtual nodes, virtual routers, and virtual services  in AWS CloudFormation. For more information, including examples of JSON and YAML templates for your App Mesh resources, see App Mesh resource type reference in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
