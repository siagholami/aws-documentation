Troubleshooting AWS App Mesh identity and access
Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might encounter when working with App Mesh and IAM.
Topics
 I am not authorized to perform an action in App Mesh
 I want to view my access keys
 I'm an administrator and want to allow others to access App Mesh
 I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my App Mesh resources
I am not authorized to perform an action in App Mesh
If the AWS Management Console tells you that you're not authorized to perform an action, then you must contact your administrator for assistance. Your administrator is the person that provided you with your user name and password.
The following error occurs when the mateojackson IAM user tries to use the console to create a virtual node named my-virtual-node in the mesh named my-mesh but does not have the appmesh:CreateVirtualNode permission.
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: appmesh:CreateVirtualNode on resource: arn:aws:appmesh:us-east-1:123456789012:mesh/my-mesh/virtualNode/my-virtual-node
In this case, Mateo asks his administrator to update his policies to allow him to create a virtual node using the appmesh:CreateVirtualNode action.
Note
Since a virtual node is created within a mesh, Mateo's account also requires the appmesh:DescribeMesh and appmesh:ListMeshes actions to create the virtual node in the console.
I want to view my access keys
After you create your IAM user access keys, you can view your access key ID at any time. However, you can't view your secret access key again. If you lose your secret key, you must create a new access key pair. 
Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (for example, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY). Like a user name and password, you must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests. Manage your access keys as securely as you do your user name and password.
Important
 Do not provide your access keys to a third party, even to help find your canonical user ID. By doing this, you might give someone permanent access to your account. 
When you create an access key pair, you are prompted to save the access key ID and secret access key in a secure location. The secret access key is available only at the time you create it. If you lose your secret access key, you must add new access keys to your IAM user. You can have a maximum of two access keys. If you already have two, you must delete one key pair before creating a new one. To view instructions, see Managing Access Keys in the IAM User Guide.
I'm an administrator and want to allow others to access App Mesh
To allow others to access App Mesh, you must create an IAM entity (user or role) for the person or application that needs access. They will use the credentials for that entity to access AWS. You must then attach a policy to the entity that grants them the correct permissions in App Mesh.
To get started right away, see Creating Your First IAM Delegated User and Group in the IAM User Guide.
I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my App Mesh resources
You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant people access to your resources.
