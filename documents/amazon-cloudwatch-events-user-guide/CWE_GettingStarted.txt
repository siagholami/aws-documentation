 Some target types might not be available in every region. For more information, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
 Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console.
 If you create a rule with an encrypted Amazon SQS queue as a target, you must have the following section included in your KMS key policy. It allows the event to be successfully delivered to the encrypted queue.
