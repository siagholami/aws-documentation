Handling Exceptions
An AWS Certificate Manager command might fail for several reasons. For information about each exception, see the table below. 
Private Certificate Exception Handling
The following exceptions can occur when you attempt to renew a private PKI certificate issued by ACM Private CA. 



ACM failure code
Comment




PCA_ACCESS_DENIED
The private CA has not granted ACM permissions. This triggers a PCA AccessDeniedException failure code. To remedy the problem, grant the necessary permissions to the ACM service principal using the PCA CreatePermission operation.


PCA_INVALID_DURATION
The validity period of the requested certificate excedes the validity period of the issuing private CA. This triggers a PCA ValidationException failure code. To remedy the problem, install a new CA certificate with an appropriate validity period.


PCA_INVALID_STATE
The private CA being called is not in the correct state to perform the requested ACM operation. This triggers a PCA InvalidStateException failure code.  Resolve the issue as follows: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


PCA_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
The private CA has reached an issuance quota. This triggers a PCA LimitExceededException failure code. Try repeating your request before proceeding with this help. If the error persists, contact AWS Support to request a quota increase.


PCA_REQUEST_FAILED
A network or system error occurred. This triggers a PCA RequestFailedException failure code. Try repeating your request before proceeding with this help. If the error persists, contact AWS Support.


PCA_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND
The private CA has been permanently deleted. This triggers a PCA ResourceNotFoundException failure code. Verify that you used the correct ARN. If that fails, you won't be able to use this CA. To remedy the problem, create a new CA.


SLR_NOT_FOUND
In order to renew a certificate signed by a private CA that resides in another account, ACM requires a Service Linked Role (SLR) on the account where the certificate resides. If you need to recreate a deleted SLR, see Creating the SLR for ACM.
