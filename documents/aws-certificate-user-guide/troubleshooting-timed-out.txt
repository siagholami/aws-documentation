Certificate Request Times Out
Requests for ACM certificates time out if they are not validated within 72 hours. To correct this condition, delete your request and choose Request a certificate to begin again. For more information, see Using DNS to Validate Domain Ownership or Using Email to Validate Domain Ownership. We recommend that you use DNS validation if possible.
