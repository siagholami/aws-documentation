# Certificate Request Times Out<a name="troubleshooting-timed-out"></a>

Requests for ACM certificates time out if they are not validated within 72 hours\. To correct this condition, delete your request and choose **Request a certificate** to begin again\. For more information, see [Using DNS to Validate Domain Ownership](gs-acm-validate-dns.md) or [Using Email to Validate Domain Ownership](gs-acm-validate-email.md)\. We recommend that you use DNS validation if possible\.
