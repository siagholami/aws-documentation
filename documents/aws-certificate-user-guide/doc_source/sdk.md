# Using the ACM API<a name="sdk"></a>

You can use the AWS Certificate Manager API to interact with the service programmatically by sending HTTP requests\. For more information, see the [AWS Certificate Manager API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/APIReference/)\.

In addition to the web API \(or HTTP API\), you can use the AWS SDKs and command line tools to interact with ACM and other services\. For more information, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)\.

The following topics show you how to use one of the AWS SDKs, the [AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/), to perform some of the available operations in the AWS Certificate Manager API\.
