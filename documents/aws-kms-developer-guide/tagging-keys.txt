Tagging keys
A tag is a metadata label that you can assign (or AWS can assign) to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value, both of which are case-sensitive strings. The tag value can be an empty (null) string. Each tag on a resource must have a different tag key, but you can add the same tag to multiple AWS resources. Each resource can have up to 50 user-created tags. 
In AWS KMS, you can add tags to a customer managed CMK when you create the CMK, and add or edit tags on existing CMKs unless they are pending deletion. You cannot tag aliases, AWS managed CMKs, or AWS owned CMKs.
For example, you can add a "Project"="Alpha" tag to all CMKs and Amazon S3 buckets that you use for the Alpha project.
TagKey   = "Project"
TagValue = "Alpha"
For more information, see Creating keys and Editing keys. For general information about tags, including the format and syntax, see Tagging AWS resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
Tags help you do the following:
 Identify and organize your AWS resources. Many AWS services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can assign the same tag to an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) and an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or AWS Secrets Manager secret. You can also use tags to identify CMK for automation.
 Track your AWS costs. When you add tags to your AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags. You can use this feature to track AWS KMS costs for a project, application, or cost center.
For more information about using tags for cost allocation, see Using Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide. For information about the rules for tag keys and tag values, see User-Defined Tag Restrictions in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
AWS KMS writes an entry to your AWS CloudTrail log when you use the TagResource, UntagResource, or ListResourceTags operations.

Managing CMK tags (console)
You can add tags to a CMK when you create the CMK in the AWS KMS console. You can also use the console to add, edit, and delete tags on customer managed CMKs. 
To add, edit, or delete a tag for an existing CMK


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.


To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.


In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys. (You cannot manage the tags of an AWS managed CMK.)


Select the check box next to the alias of a CMK.


Choose Key actions, Add or edit tags.


On the details page for CMK, choose the Tags tab.
    To create your first tag, choose Create tag, type a tag name (required) and tag value (optional), and then choose Save.
If you leave the tag value blank, the actual tag value is a null or empty string.
    To add a tag, choose Edit, choose Add tag, type a tag name and tag value, and then choose Save.
    To change the name or value of a tag, choose Edit, make your changes, and then choose Save.
    To delete a tag, choose Edit. On the tag row, choose Remove, and then choose Save.


To save your changes, choose Save changes.


Managing CMK Tags (AWS KMS API)
You can use the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) API to add, delete, and list tags for the CMKs that you manage. These examples use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any supported programming language. 
You cannot tag AWS managed CMKs.

 CreateKey: Add tags to a new CMK
 TagResource: Add or change tags for a CMK
 ListResourceTags: Get the tags for a CMK
 UntagResource: Delete tags from a CMK
CreateKey: Add tags to a new CMK
You can add tags when you create a customer managed CMK. To specify the tags, use the Tags parameter of the CreateKey operation. The value of the Tags parameter is a collection of case-sensitive tag key and tag value pairs. 
Each tag on a CMK must have a different tag name. The tag value can be a null or empty string.
For example, the following AWS CLI command creates a symmetric CMK with a Project:Alpha tag. When specifying more than one key-value pair, use a space to separate each pair. 
$ aws kms create-key --tags TagKey=Project,TagValue=Alpha
When this command is successful, it returns a KeyMetadata object with information about the new CMK. However, the KeyMetadata does not include tags. To get the tags, use the ListResourceTags operation.
TagResource: Add or change tags for a CMK
The TagResource operation adds one or more tags to a CMK. 
To add a tag, specify a new tag key and a tag value. To edit a tag, specify an existing tag key and a new tag value. Each tag on a CMK must have a different tag name. The tag value can be a null or empty string.
For example, the following command adds Purpose and Department tags to an example CMK.
$ aws kms tag-resource \
         --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
         --tags TagKey=Purpose,TagValue=Pretest TagKey=Department,TagValue=Finance
When this command is successful, it does not return any output. To view the tags on a CMK, use the ListResourceTags operation.
You can also use TagResource to change the tag value of an existing tag. To replace a tag value, specify the same tag key with a different value.
For example, this command changes the value of the Purpose tag from Pretest to Test.
$ aws kms tag-resource \
         --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
         --tags TagKey=Purpose,TagValue=Test
ListResourceTags: Get the tags for a CMK
The ListResourceTags operation gets the tags for a CMK. The key-id parameter is required.
For example, the following command gets the tags for an example CMK.
```
$ aws kms list-resource-tags --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
"Truncated": false,
"Tags": [
    {
        "TagKey": "Project",
        "TagValue": "Alpha"
    }
    {
        "TagKey": "Purpose",
        "TagValue": "Test"
    },
    {
        "TagKey": "Department",
        "TagValue": "Finance"
    }
]

}
```
UntagResource: Delete tags from a CMK
The UntagResource operation deletes tags from a CMK. The key-id and tag-keys parameters are required.
When it succeeds, the UntagResource operation doesn't return any output. Also, if the specified tag key isn't found on the CMK, it doesn't throw an exception or return a response. To confirm that the operation worked, use the ListResourceTags operation.
For example, this command deletes the Purpose tag and its value from the specified CMK.
$ aws kms untag-resource --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab --tag-keys Purpose
When this command is successful, it does not return any output.
