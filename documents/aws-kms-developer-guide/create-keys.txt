Creating keys
You can create symmetric and asymmetric customer master keys (CMKs) in the AWS Management Console or by using the CreateKey operation. During this process, you determine the cryptographic configuration of your CMK and the origin of its key material. You cannot change these properties after the CMK is created. You also set the key policy for the CMK, which you can change at any time.
If you are creating a CMK to encrypt data you store or manage in an AWS service, create a symmetric CMK. AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS use symmetric CMKs to encrypt your data. These services do not support encryption with asymmetric CMKs. For help deciding which type of CMK to create, see How to choose your CMK configuration.
When you create a CMK in the AWS KMS console, you are required to give it an alias (friendly name). The CreateKey operation does not create an alias for the new CMK. To create an alias for a new or existing CMK, use the CreateAlias operation. For detailed information about aliases in AWS KMS, see Using aliases.
To create a CMK, in the console or by using the APIs, you must have kms:CreateKey permission in an IAM policy. To add tags while creating a key, you must have kms:TagResource permission. If you're using the console where an alias is required for every new CMK, you need kms:CreateAlias permission on the CMK and the alias. For details, including example policies, see [Allow a user to create CMKs The following IAM policy allows a user to create CMKs. The value of the Resource element is * because the CreateKey operation does not use any particular AWS KMS resources (CMKs or aliases). 
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "kms:CreateKey",
    "Resource": "*"
  }
} Principals who create keys might need some related permissions.   kms:PutKeyPolicy — Principals who have kms:CreateKey permission can set the initial key policy for the CMK. However, the CreateKey caller must have kms:PutKeyPolicy permission, which lets them change the CMK's key policy, or they must specify the BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck parameter of CreateKey, which is not recommended. The CreateKey caller can get kms:PutKeyPolicy permission for the CMK from an IAM policy or they can include this permission in the key policy of the CMK that they're creating.   kms:TagResource — To add tags to the CMK during the CreateKey operation, the CreateKey caller must have kms:TagResource permission in an IAM policy. Including this permission in the key policy of the new CMK isn't sufficient. However, if the CreateKey caller includes kms:TagResource in the initial key policy, they can add tags in a separate call after the CMK is created.   kms:CreateAlias — Principals who create a CMK in the AWS KMS console must have kms:CreateAlias permission on the CMK and on the alias. (The console makes two calls; one to CreateKey and one to CreateAlias). You must provide the alias permission in an IAM policy. You can provide the CMK permission in a key policy or IAM policy. For details, see Controlling access to aliases.   In addition to kms:CreateKey, the following IAM policy provides kms:TagResource permission on all CMKs in the AWS account and kms:CreateAlias permission on all aliases that the account. It also includes some useful read-only permissions that can be provided only in an IAM policy.  This IAM policy does not include kms:PutKeyPolicy permission or any other permissions that can be set in a key policy. It's a best practice to set these permissions in the key policy where they apply exclusively to one CMK.

Creating symmetric CMKs
You can create symmetric CMKs in the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS KMS API. Symmetric key encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. 
Creating symmetric CMKs (console)
You can use the AWS Management Console to create customer master keys (CMKs).


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.


To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.


In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.


Choose Create key.


To create a symmetric CMK, for Key type choose Symmetric.


For information about how to create an asymmetric CMK in the AWS KMS console, see Creating asymmetric CMKs (console).


Choose Next.


Type an alias for the CMK. The alias name cannot begin with aws/. The aws/ prefix is reserved by Amazon Web Services to represent AWS managed CMKs in your account.


An alias is a display name that you can use to identify the CMK. We recommend that you choose an alias that indicates the type of data you plan to protect or the application you plan to use with the CMK.
Aliases are required when you create a CMK in the AWS Management Console. They are optional when you use the CreateKey operation.

(Optional) Type a description for the CMK.

Enter a description that explains the type of data you plan to protect or the application you plan to use with the CMK. Don't use the description format that's used for AWS managed CMKs. The Default master key that protects my ... when no other key is defined description format is reserved for AWS managed CMKs.
You can add a description now or update it any time unless the key state is Pending Deletion. To add, change, or delete the description of an existing customer managed CMK, edit the CMK in the AWS Management Console or use the UpdateKeyDescription operation.


Choose Next.


(Optional) Type a tag key and an optional tag value. To add more than one tag to the CMK, choose Add tag.


When you add tags to your AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags. For information about tagging CMKs, see Tagging keys.


Choose Next.


Select the IAM users and roles that can administer the CMK.
Note
IAM policies can give other IAM users and roles permission to manage the CMK.


(Optional) To prevent the selected IAM users and roles from deleting this CMK, in the Key deletion section at the bottom of the page, clear the Allow key administrators to delete this key check box.


Choose Next.


Select the IAM users and roles that can use the CMK for cryptographic operations.
Note
The AWS account (root user) has full permissions by default. As a result, any IAM policies can also give users and roles permission use the CMK for cryptographic operations.


(Optional) You can allow other AWS accounts to use this CMK for cryptographic operations. To do so, in the Other AWS accounts section at the bottom of the page, choose Add another AWS account and enter the AWS account identification number of an external account. To add multiple external accounts, repeat this step.
Note
To allow principals in the external accounts to use the CMK, Administrators of the external account must create IAM policies that provide these permissions. For more information, see Allowing users in other accounts to use a CMK.

Choose Finish to create the CMK.


Creating symmetric CMKs (AWS KMS API)
You can use the CreateKey operation to create a new symmetric customer master key (CMK). These examples use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any supported programming language. 
This operation has no required parameters. However, you might also want to use the Policy parameter to specify a key policy. You can change the key policy (PutKeyPolicy) and add optional elements, such as a description and tags at any time. Also, if you are creating a CMK for imported key material or a CMK in a custom key store, the Origin parameter is required. 
The following is an example of a call to the CreateKey operation with no parameters. This command uses all of the default values. It creates a symmetric CMK for encrypting and decrypting with key material generated by AWS KMS.
$ aws kms create-key
{
    "KeyMetadata": {
        "Origin": "AWS_KMS",
        "KeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
        "Description": "",
        "KeyManager": "CUSTOMER",
        "Enabled": true,
        "CustomerMasterKeySpec": "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT",
        "KeyUsage": "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT",
        "KeyState": "Enabled",
        "CreationDate": 1502910355.475,
        "Arn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
        "AWSAccountId": "111122223333"
        "EncryptionAlgorithms": [
            "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT"
        ]
    }
}
If you do not specify a key policy for your new CMK, the default key policy that CreateKey applies differs from the default key policy that the console applies when you use it to create a new CMK. 
For example, this call to the GetKeyPolicy operation returns the key policy that CreateKey applies. It gives the AWS account access to the CMK and allows it to create AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for the CMK. For detailed information about IAM policies and key policies for CMKs, see Authentication and access control for AWS KMS

Creating asymmetric CMKs
You can create asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS KMS API. An asymmetric CMK represents a public and private key pair that can be used for encryption or signing. 
If you are creating a CMK to encrypt data that you store or manage in an AWS service, use a symmetric CMK. AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS do not support asymmetric CMKs. For help deciding whether to create a symmetric or asymmetric CMK, see How to Choose Your CMK Configuration. 
Creating asymmetric CMKs (console)
You can use the AWS Management Console to create asymmetric customer master keys (CMKs). Each asymmetric CMK represents a public and private key pair.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.


To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.


In the navigation pane, choose Customer managed keys.


Choose Create key.


To create an asymmetric CMK, in Key type, choose Asymmetric.


For information about how to create an symmetric CMK in the AWS KMS console, see Creating symmetric CMKs (console).

To create an asymmetric CMK for public key encryption, in Key usage, choose Encrypt and decrypt. Or, to create an asymmetric CMK for signing messages and verifying signatures, in Key usage, choose Sign and verify.

For help choosing a key usage value, see Selecting the key usage.

Select a specification (Key spec) for your asymmetric CMK. 

Often the key spec that you select is determined by regulatory, security, or business requrirements. It might also be influenced by the size of messages that you need to encrypt or sign. In general, longer encryption keys are more resistant to brute-force attacks.
For help choosing a key spec, see Selecting the key spec.

Creating asymmetric CMKs (AWS KMS API)
You can use the CreateKey operation to create an asymmetric customer master key (CMK). These examples use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any supported programming language. 
When you create an asymmetric CMK, you must specify the CustomerMasterKeySpec parameter, which determines the type of keys you create. Also, you must specify a KeyUsage value of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT or SIGN_VERIFY. You cannot change these properties after the CMK is created.
The following example uses the CreateKey operation to create an asymmetric CMK of 4096-bit RSA keys designed for public key encryption.
$ aws kms create-key --customer-master-key-spec RSA_4096 --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT
{
    "KeyMetadata": {
        "KeyState": "Enabled",
        "KeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
        "CustomerMasterKeySpec": "RSA_4096",
        "KeyManager": "CUSTOMER",
        "Description": "",
        "KeyUsage": "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
        "CreationDate": 1569973196.214,
        "EncryptionAlgorithms": [
            "RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1",
            "RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256"
        ],
        "AWSAccountId": "111122223333",
        "Origin": "AWS_KMS",
        "Enabled": true
    }
}
The following example command creates an asymmetric CMK that represents a pair of ECDSA keys used for signing and verification. You cannot create an elliptic curve key pair for encryption and decryption.
$ aws kms create-key --customer-master-key-spec ECC_NIST_P521 --key-usage SIGN_VERIFY
{
    "KeyMetadata": {
        "KeyState": "Enabled",
        "KeyId": "0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321",
