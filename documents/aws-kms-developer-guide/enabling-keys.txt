Enabling and disabling keys
You can disable and reenable the customer master keys (CMKs) that you manage. You cannot enable or disable AWS managed CMKs.
When you create a CMK, it is enabled by default. If you disable a CMK, it cannot be used to encrypt or decrypt data until you re-enable it. AWS managed CMKs are permanently enabled for use by services that use AWS KMS. You cannot disable them.
You can also delete CMKs. For more information, see Deleting customer master keys.
Note
AWS KMS does not rotate the backing keys of customer managed CMKs while they are disabled. For more information, see How automatic key rotation works.

Enabling and disabling CMKs (AWS KMS API)
The EnableKey operation enables a disabled AWS KMS customer master key (CMK). These examples use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), but you can use any supported programming language. The key-id parameter is required.
This operation does not return any output. To see the key status, use the DescribeKey operation.
$ aws kms enable-key --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
The DisableKey operation disables an enabled CMK. The key-id parameter is required.
$ aws kms disable-key --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
This operation does not return any output. To see the key status, use the DescribeKey operation, and see the Enabled field.
$ aws kms describe-key --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
