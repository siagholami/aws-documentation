# Using CMKs in a custom key store<a name="use-cmk-keystore"></a>

After you [create a symmetric CMK in a custom key store](create-cmk-keystore.md), you can use it for the following cryptographic operations:
+ [Encrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html)
+ [Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html)
+ [GenerateDataKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKey.html)
+ [GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext.html)
+ [ReEncrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ReEncrypt.html)

Asymmetric CMKs and asymmetric data key pairs are not supported in a custom key store\. As a result, you cannot use the operations that are specific to asymmetric CMKs â€” [Sign](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Sign.html), [Verify](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Verify.html), and [GetPublicKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html)\. Also, the operations that generate asymmetric data key pairs, [GenerateDataKeyPair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKeyPair.html) and [GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext.html), are not supported in a custom key store\.

When you use your CMK in a request, identify the CMK by its ID or alias; you do not need to specify the custom key store or AWS CloudHSM cluster\. The response includes the same fields that are returned for any symmetric CMK\.

However, when you use a CMK in a custom key store, the cryptographic operation is performed entirely within the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store\. The operation uses the key material in the cluster that is associated with the CMK that you chose\.

To make this possible, the following conditions are required\.
+ The [key state](key-state.md) of the CMK must be `Enabled`\. To find the key state, use the **Status** field in the [AWS Management Console](view-cmk-keystore.md) or the `KeyState` field in the [DescribeKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html) response\.
+ The custom key store must be connected to its AWS CloudHSM cluster\. Its **Status** in the [AWS Management Console](view-keystore.md) or `ConnectionState` in the [DescribeCustomKeyStores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCustomKeyStores.html) response must be `CONNECTED`\.
+ The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must contain at least one active HSM\. To find the number of active HSMs in the cluster, use the [AWS KMS console](view-keystore.md), the AWS CloudHSM console, or the [DescribeClusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html) operation\.
+ The AWS CloudHSM cluster must contain the key material for the CMK\. If the key material was deleted from the cluster, or an HSM was created from a backup that did not include the key material, the cryptographic operation will fail\.

If these conditions are not met, the cryptographic operation fails, and AWS KMS returns a `KMSInvalidStateException` exception\. Typically, you just need to [reconnect the custom key store](disconnect-keystore.md)\. For additional help, see [How to fix a failing CMK](fix-keystore.md#fix-cmk-failed)\.

When using the CMKs in a custom key store, be aware that the CMKs in each custom key store share a [per\-second quota](requests-per-second.md#rps-key-stores) on requests for cryptographic operations\. If you exceed the quota, AWS KMS returns a `ThrottlingException`\. If the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store is processing numerous commands, including those unrelated to the custom key store, you might get a `ThrottlingException` at an even lower rate\. If you get a `ThrottlingException` for any request, lower your request rate and try the commands again\. For details about the request quota for cryptographic operations in a custom key store, see [Custom key store quota](requests-per-second.md#rps-key-stores)\.
