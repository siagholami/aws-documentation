# Quotas<a name="limits"></a>

To make AWS KMS responsive and performant for all users, AWS KMS applies two types of quotas\. Each quota is calculated independently for each Region of each AWS account\.

**Important**  
If you need to exceed a quota, you can request a quota increase in Service Quotas\. Use the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas) or the [RequestServiceQuotaIncrease](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/2019-06-24/apireference/API_RequestServiceQuotaIncrease.html) operation\. For details, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\. If Service Quotas for AWS KMS are not available in the AWS Region, please visit the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) and create a case\.   
For help requesting an increase in an AWS KMS quota, see [Request an AWS KMS Quota Increase](increase-quota.md)\.
