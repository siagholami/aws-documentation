Enabling CloudWatch Query Metrics
When you create a workgroup in the console, the setting for publishing query metrics to CloudWatch is selected by default.
To enable or disable query metrics in the Athena console for a workgroup


Open the Athena console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/.


Choose the Workgroup tab.


Choose the workgroup that you want to modify, and then choose View details.


Choose Edit workgroup.


On the Edit workgroup page, under Metrics, select or clear the Publish query metrics to AWS CloudWatch option.


If you use API operations, the command line interface, or the client application with the JDBC driver to create workgroups, to enable publishing of query metrics, set PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled to true in WorkGroupConfiguration. The following example shows only the metrics configuration and omits other configuration:
"WorkGroupConfiguration": { 
      "PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled": "true"
     ....
     }
