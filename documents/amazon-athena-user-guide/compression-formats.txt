Compression Formats
The compression formats listed in this section are used for CREATE TABLE queries. For CTAS queries, Athena supports GZIP and SNAPPY (for data stored in Parquet and ORC). If you omit a format, GZIP is used by default. For more information, see CREATE TABLE AS.
Athena supports the following compression formats:
 SNAPPY – The default compression format for files in the Parquet data storage format. 
 ZLIB – The default compression format for files in the ORC data storage format.
 LZO
 GZIP
 BZIP2
Notes and Resources

For data in CSV, TSV, and JSON, Athena determines the compression type from the file extension. If no file extension is present, Athena treats the data as uncompressed plain text. If your data is compressed, make sure the file name includes the compression extension, such as gz.
The ZIP file format is not supported. 
For querying Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose logs from Athena, supported formats include GZIP compression or ORC files with SNAPPY compression. 
For more information on using compression, see section 3 ("Compress and split files") of the AWS Big Data Blog post Top 10 Performance Tuning Tips for Amazon Athena.
