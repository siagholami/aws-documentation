Using Apache Hive Metastore as a Metacatalog with Amazon Athena
You can now connect Athena to one or more Apache Hive metastores in addition to the AWS Glue Data Catalog with Athena.
To connect to a self-hosted Hive metastore, you need an Athena Hive metastore connector. Athena provides a reference implementation connector that you can use. The connector runs as an AWS Lambda function in your account. 
For more information, see Using Athena Data Connector for External Hive Metastore.
