Creating a Table from Query Results (CTAS)
A CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) query creates a new table in Athena from the results of a SELECT statement from another query. Athena stores data files created by the CTAS statement in a specified location in Amazon S3. For syntax, see CREATE TABLE AS.
Use CTAS queries to: 
 Create tables from query results in one step, without repeatedly querying raw data sets. This makes it easier to work with raw data sets.
 Transform query results into other storage formats, such as Parquet and ORC. This improves query performance and reduces query costs in Athena. For information, see Columnar Storage Formats.
 Create copies of existing tables that contain only the data you need.
