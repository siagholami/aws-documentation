Amazon Athena DocumentDB Connector
The Amazon Athena Amazon DocumentDB connector enables Amazon Athena to communicate with your Amazon DocumentDB instances so that you can query your Amazon DocumentDB data with SQL. The connector also works with any endpoint that is compatible with MongoDB.
For information about how the connector generates schemas, configuration options, permissions, deployment, and performance considerations, see Amazon Athena DocumentDB Connector on GitHub.
