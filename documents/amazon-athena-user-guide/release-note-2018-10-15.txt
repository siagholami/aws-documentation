If you have upgraded to the AWS Glue Data Catalog, there are two new features that provide support for: 
 Encryption of the Data Catalog metadata. If you choose to encrypt metadata in the Data Catalog, you must add specific policies to Athena. For more information, see Access to Encrypted Metadata in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
 Fine-grained permissions to access resources in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. You can now define identity-based (IAM) policies that restrict or allow access to specific databases and tables from the Data Catalog used in Athena. For more information, see Fine-Grained Access to Databases and Tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
Note
Data resides in the Amazon S3 buckets, and access to it is governed by the Amazon S3 Permissions. To access data in databases and tables, continue to use access control policies to Amazon S3 buckets that store the data.
