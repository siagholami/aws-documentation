Key Management
Amazon Athena supports AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt datasets in Amazon S3 and Athena query results. AWS KMS uses customer master keys (CMKs) to encrypt your Amazon S3 objects and relies on envelope encryption. 
In AWS KMS, you can perform the following actions:
  Create keys 
  Import your own key material for new CMKs 
Note
Athena supports only symmetric keys for reading and writing data.
For more information, see What is AWS Key Management Service in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide, and How Amazon Simple Storage Service Uses AWS KMS. To view the keys in your account that AWS creates and manages for you, in the navigation pane, choose AWS managed keys.
If you are uploading or accessing objects encrypted by SSE-KMS, use AWS Signature Version 4 for added security. For more information, see Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
