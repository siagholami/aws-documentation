Using a Default Catalog in External Hive Metastore Queries
When you run DML and DDL queries on external Hive metastores, you can simplify your query syntax by omitting the catalog name if that name is selected in the query editor. Certain restrictions apply to this functionality.
DML Statements
To run queries with registered catalogs

You can put the catalog name before the database using the syntax [[catalog_name].database_name].table_name, as in the following example.

select * from  "hms-catalog-1".hms_tpch.customer limit 10;


When the catalog that you want to use is already selected as your data source, you can omit the catalog name from the query, as in the following example.

select * from hms_tpch.customer limit 10:


For multiple catalogs, you can omit only the default catalog name. Specify the full name for any non-default catalogs. For example, the FROM statement in the following query omits the catalog name for AWS Glue catalog, but it fully qualifies the first two catalog names.

...
   FROM ehms01.hms_tpch.customer,
            "hms-catalog-1".hms_tpch.orders,
            hms_tpch.lineitem
   ...

DDL Statements
The following Athena DDL statements support catalog name prefixes. Catalog name prefixes in other DDL statements cause syntax errors.
```
SHOW TABLES [IN [catalog_name.]database_name] ['regular_expression']
SHOW TBLPROPERTIES [[catalog_name.]database_name.]table_name [('property_name')]
SHOW COLUMNS IN [[catalog_name.]database_name.]table_name
SHOW PARTITIONS [[catalog_name.]database_name.]table_name
SHOW CREATE TABLE [[catalog_name.][database_name.]table_name
DESCRIBE [EXTENDED | FORMATTED] [[catalog_name.][database_name.]table_name [PARTITION partition_spec] [col_name ( [.field_name] | [.'$elem$'] | [.'$key$'] | [.'$value$'] )]
```
As with DML statements, when you select the catalog and the database in the Data source panel, you can omit the catalog prefix from the query.
In the following example, the data source and database are selected in the query editor. The show create table customer statement succeeds when the hms-catalog-1 prefix and the hms_tpch database name are omitted from the query.
