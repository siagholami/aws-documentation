# DML Queries, Functions, and Operators<a name="functions-operators-reference-section"></a>

Athena DML query statements are based on [Presto 0\.172](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.172/index.html)\. For more information about these functions, see [Presto 0\.172 Functions and Operators](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.172/functions.html) in the open source Presto documentation\. We provide links to specific subsections of that documentation in the [Presto Functions](presto-functions.md) topic\.

Athena does not support all of Presto's features, and there are some significant differences\. For more information, see the reference topics for specific statements in this section and [Considerations and Limitations](other-notable-limitations.md)\.
