# Querying Amazon CloudFront Logs<a name="cloudfront-logs"></a>

You can configure Amazon CloudFront CDN to export Web distribution access logs to Amazon Simple Storage Service\. Use these logs to explore usersâ€™ surfing patterns across your web properties served by CloudFront\.

Before you begin querying the logs, enable Web distributions access log on your preferred CloudFront distribution\. For information, see [Access Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*\.

Make a note of the Amazon S3 bucket to which to save these logs\.

**Note**  
This procedure works for the Web distribution access logs in CloudFront\. It does not apply to streaming logs from RTMP distributions\.

## Creating the Table for CloudFront Logs<a name="create-cloudfront-table"></a>

### To create the CloudFront table<a name="to-create-the-cf-table"></a>

1. Copy and paste the following DDL statement into the Athena console\. Modify the `LOCATION` for the Amazon S3 bucket that stores your logs\.

   This query uses the [LazySimpleSerDe](lazy-simple-serde.md) by default and it is omitted\. 

   The column `date` is escaped using backticks \(`\) because it is a reserved word in Athena\. For information, see [Reserved Keywords](reserved-words.md)\.

   ```
   CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS default.cloudfront_logs (
     `date` DATE,
     time STRING,
     location STRING,
     bytes BIGINT,
     request_ip STRING,
     method STRING,
     host STRING,
     uri STRING,
     status INT,
     referrer STRING,
     user_agent STRING,
     query_string STRING,
     cookie STRING,
     result_type STRING,
     request_id STRING,
     host_header STRING,
     request_protocol STRING,
     request_bytes BIGINT,
     time_taken FLOAT,
     xforwarded_for STRING,
     ssl_protocol STRING,
     ssl_cipher STRING,
     response_result_type STRING,
     http_version STRING,
     fle_status STRING,
     fle_encrypted_fields INT,
     c_port INT,
     time_to_first_byte FLOAT,
     x_edge_detailed_result_type STRING,
     sc_content_type STRING,
     sc_content_len BIGINT,
     sc_range_start BIGINT,
     sc_range_end BIGINT
   )
   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
   FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
   LOCATION 's3://CloudFront_bucket_name/CloudFront/'
   TBLPROPERTIES ( 'skip.header.line.count'='2' )
   ```

1. Run the query in Athena console\. After the query completes, Athena registers the `cloudfront_logs` table, making the data in it ready for you to issue queries\.

## Example Query for CloudFront Logs<a name="query-examples-cloudfront-logs"></a>

The following query adds up the number of bytes served by CloudFront between June 9 and June 11, 2018\. Surround the date column name with double quotes because it is a reserved word\.

```
SELECT SUM(bytes) AS total_bytes
FROM cloudfront_logs
WHERE "date" BETWEEN DATE '2018-06-09' AND DATE '2018-06-11'
LIMIT 100;
```

To eliminate duplicate rows \(for example, duplicate empty rows\) from the query results, you can use the `SELECT DISTINCT` statement, as in the following example\. 

```
SELECT DISTINCT * 
FROM cloudfront_logs 
LIMIT 10;
```
