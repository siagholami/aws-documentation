# SQL Reference for Amazon Athena<a name="ddl-sql-reference"></a>

Amazon Athena supports a subset of Data Definition Language \(DDL\) and Data Manipulation Language \(DML\) statements, functions, operators, and data types\. With some exceptions, Athena DDL is based on [HiveQL DDL](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL) and Athena DML is based on [Presto 0\.172](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.172/index.html)\.
