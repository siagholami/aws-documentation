# Access to Workgroups and Tags<a name="workgroups-access"></a>

A workgroup is a resource managed by Athena\. Therefore, if your workgroup policy uses actions that take `workgroup` as an input, you must specify the workgroup's ARN as follows, where `workgroup-name` is the name of your workgroup:

```
"Resource": [arn:aws:athena:region:AWSAcctID:workgroup/workgroup-name]
```

For example, for a workgroup named `test_workgroup` in the `us-west-2` region for AWS account `123456789012`, specify the workgroup as a resource using the following ARN:

```
"Resource":["arn:aws:athena:us-east-2:123456789012:workgroup/test_workgroup"]
```
