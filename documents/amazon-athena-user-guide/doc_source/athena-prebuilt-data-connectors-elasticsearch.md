# Amazon Athena Elasticsearch Connector<a name="athena-prebuilt-data-connectors-elasticsearch"></a>

The Amazon Athena Elasticsearch connector enables Amazon Athena to communicate with your Elasticsearch instances so that you can use SQL to query your Elasticsearch data\. This connector works with the Amazon Elasticsearch Service or any Elasticsearch\-compatible endpoint that is configured with `Elasticsearch version 7.0` or higher\.

For information about configuration options, databases and tables, data types, deployment, and performance considerations, see [Amazon Athena Elasticsearch Connector](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/tree/master/athena-elasticsearch) on GitHub\.
