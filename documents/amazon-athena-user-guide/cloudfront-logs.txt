Querying Amazon CloudFront Logs
You can configure Amazon CloudFront CDN to export Web distribution access logs to Amazon Simple Storage Service. Use these logs to explore usersâ€™ surfing patterns across your web properties served by CloudFront.
Before you begin querying the logs, enable Web distributions access log on your preferred CloudFront distribution. For information, see Access Logs in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.
Make a note of the Amazon S3 bucket to which to save these logs.
Note
This procedure works for the Web distribution access logs in CloudFront. It does not apply to streaming logs from RTMP distributions.

Creating the Table for CloudFront Logs
To create the CloudFront table

Copy and paste the following DDL statement into the Athena console. Modify the LOCATION for the Amazon S3 bucket that stores your logs.

This query uses the LazySimpleSerDe by default and it is omitted. 
The column date is escaped using backticks (`) because it is a reserved word in Athena. For information, see Reserved Keywords.
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS default.cloudfront_logs (
     `date` DATE,
     time STRING,
     location STRING,
     bytes BIGINT,
     request_ip STRING,

   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
   FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
   LOCATION 's3://CloudFront_bucket_name/CloudFront/'
   TBLPROPERTIES ( 'skip.header.line.count'='2' )

Run the query in Athena console. After the query completes, Athena registers the cloudfront_logs table, making the data in it ready for you to issue queries.

Example Query for CloudFront Logs
The following query adds up the number of bytes served by CloudFront between June 9 and June 11, 2018. Surround the date column name with double quotes because it is a reserved word.
SELECT SUM(bytes) AS total_bytes
FROM cloudfront_logs
WHERE "date" BETWEEN DATE '2018-06-09' AND DATE '2018-06-11'
LIMIT 100;
To eliminate duplicate rows (for example, duplicate empty rows) from the query results, you can use the SELECT DISTINCT statement, as in the following example. 
SELECT DISTINCT * 
FROM cloudfront_logs 
LIMIT 10;
