LazySimpleSerDe for CSV, TSV, and Custom-Delimited Files
Specifying this SerDe is optional. This is the SerDe for data in CSV, TSV, and custom-delimited formats that Athena uses by default. This SerDe is used if you don't specify any SerDe and only specify ROW FORMAT DELIMITED. Use this SerDe if your data does not have values enclosed in quotes.
For reference documentation about the LazySimpleSerDe, see the Hive SerDe section of the Apache Hive Developer Guide.
Library Name
The Class library name for the LazySimpleSerDe is org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe. For information about the LazySimpleSerDe class, see LazySimpleSerDe. 
Ignoring Headers
To ignore headers in your data when you define a table, you can use the skip.header.line.count table property, as in the following example.
TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1")
For examples, see the CREATE TABLE statements in Querying Amazon VPC Flow Logs and Querying Amazon CloudFront Logs.
Examples
The following examples show how to create tables in Athena from CSV and TSV, using the LazySimpleSerDe. To deserialize custom-delimited files using this SerDe, use the FIELDS TERMINATED BY clause to specify a single-character delimiter, as in the following examples. LazySimpleSerDe does not support multi-character delimiters.

  TSV Example 
Note
Replace myregion in s3://athena-examples-myregion/path/to/data/ with the region identifier where you run Athena, for example, s3://athena-examples-us-west-1/path/to/data/.
Note
The flight table data comes from Flights provided by US Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Desaturated from original.
CSV Example
Use the CREATE TABLE statement to create an Athena table from the underlying data in CSV stored in Amazon S3.

Run MSCK REPAIR TABLE to refresh partition metadata each time a new partition is added to this table:
MSCK REPAIR TABLE flight_delays_csv;
Query the top 10 routes delayed by more than 1 hour:

TSV Example
This example presumes source data in TSV saved in s3://mybucket/mytsv/. 
Use a CREATE TABLE statement to create an Athena table from the TSV data stored in Amazon S3. Notice that this example does not reference any SerDe class in ROW FORMAT because it uses the LazySimpleSerDe, and it can be omitted. The example specifies SerDe properties for character and line separators, and an escape character:
