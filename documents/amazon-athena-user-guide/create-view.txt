CREATE VIEW
Creates a new view from a specified SELECT query. The view is a logical table that can be referenced by future queries. Views do not contain any data and do not write data. Instead, the query specified by the view runs each time you reference the view by another query.

This topic provides summary information for reference. For more detailed information about using views in Athena, see Working with Views.
Synopsis
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] VIEW view_name AS query
The optional OR REPLACE clause lets you update the existing view by replacing it. For more information, see Creating Views.
Examples
To create a view test from the table orders, use a query similar to the following:
CREATE VIEW test AS
SELECT 
orderkey, 
orderstatus, 
totalprice / 2 AS half
FROM orders;
To create a view orders_by_date from the table orders, use the following query:
CREATE VIEW orders_by_date AS
SELECT orderdate, sum(totalprice) AS price
FROM orders
GROUP BY orderdate;
To update an existing view, use an example similar to the following:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW test AS
SELECT orderkey, orderstatus, totalprice / 4 AS quarter
FROM orders;
