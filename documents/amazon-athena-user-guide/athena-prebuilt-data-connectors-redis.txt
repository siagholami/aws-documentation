Amazon Athena Redis Connector
The Amazon Athena Redis connector enables Amazon Athena to communicate with your Redis instances so that you can query your Redis data with SQL. You can use the AWS Glue Data Catalog to map your Redis key-value pairs into virtual tables.
For information about configuration options, setting up databases and tables, data types, permissions, deployment, performance, and licensing, see Amazon Athena Redis Connector on GitHub.
