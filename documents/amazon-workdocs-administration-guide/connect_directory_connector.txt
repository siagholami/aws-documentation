Getting started with AD Connector
In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to set up an Amazon WorkDocs site using an AWS Directory Service AD Connector directory to connect to your on-premises directory. 
Topics
 Before you begin
 Step 1: Launch the Amazon WorkDocs site
 Step 2: Connect directory
 Step 3: Complete admin control panel setup
Before you begin

You must meet the prerequisites identified in AD Connector Prerequisites in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide.
When you launch a new Amazon WorkDocs site, you must specify profile information for the administrator. This information includes first name, last name, and email address. Do not use Admin for your Amazon WorkDocs account user name. Admin is a reserved user role in Amazon WorkDocs.

Step 1: Launch the Amazon WorkDocs site
Follow the steps below to launch your Amazon WorkDocs site and connect to your on-premises directory.
To launch the Amazon WorkDocs site

Open the Amazon WorkDocs console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/zocalo/.

If you have never created or connected a directory in the selected Region, you see the Amazon WorkDocs start page. After you create a directory in a particular Region, the start page is no longer available and you see the Manage Your WorkDocs Sites page instead.


Choose Get Started Now from the Amazon WorkDocs start page or choose Create a New WorkDocs Site from the Manage Your WorkDocs Sites page.


On the Get Started with WorkDocs page, next to Standard Setup, choose Launch.


Step 2: Connect directory
Follow the steps below to connect to your on-premises directory using an AWS Directory Service AD Connector directory.
To connect your directory


On the Set up a Directory page, under AD Connector choose Create AD Connector.


For Directory Details, enter the following values and choose Continue.
Directory DNS
The fully-qualified name of the on-premises directory, such as corp.example.com. Amazon WorkDocs can only access user accounts in this directory. User accounts cannot be contained in a parent directory, such as example.com.
NetBIOS Name
The NetBIOS name of the on-premises directory, such as CORP.
Account Username
The username of a user in the on-premises directory. 
Account Password
The password for the on-premises user account.
Confirm Password
Re-enter the password for the on-premises user account. This is required to prevent typing errors before the directory is connected.
DNS Address
The IP address of a DNS server or domain controller in your on-premises directory. This server must be accessible from each subnet specified below.


For Access Point, enter the following values:
Region
Verify the Region.
Site URL
Enter the URL for your Amazon WorkDocs site.


For VPC Configuration, enter the following values:
VPC
The VPC that the directory is connected to.
Subnets
The subnets in the VPC to use to connect to your on-premises directory. The two subnets must be in different Availability Zones.


Confirm that the directory information is correct, then choose Connect Directory.


It takes several minutes for the directory to be connected and the Amazon WorkDocs site to be created. When the directory has been successfully connected, the Status value of the site changes to Active.
All the users in the directory are added to your account as active Amazon WorkDocs users by default. They can sign in and start using Amazon WorkDocs at any time. For more information about user roles, see User roles overview.
Step 3: Complete admin control panel setup
After you receive the administrator registration email, connect to the Amazon WorkDocs site using the client of your choice and complete setup from your admin control panel.
To complete admin control panel setup


In the administrator registration email, use the link to sign in to Amazon WorkDocs.


Under My account, choose Open admin control panel.


Change settings for preferred language, storage, security, and recovery bin. For more information, see Managing site settings.


(Optional) Under Manage Users, choose Invite Users. You can also edit user settings. 


For more information, see Inviting and managing Amazon WorkDocs users.
