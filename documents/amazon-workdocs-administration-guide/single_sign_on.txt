Enabling single sign-on
AWS Directory Service allows users to access Amazon WorkDocs from a computer joined to the same directory with which Amazon WorkDocs is registered, without entering credentials separately. Amazon WorkDocs administrators can enable single sign-on using the AWS Directory Service console. For more information, see Single sign-on in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide.
After the Amazon WorkDocs administrator enables single sign-on, the Amazon WorkDocs site users might also need to modify their web browser settings to allow single sign-on. For more information, see Single sign-on for IE and Chrome and Single sign-on for Firefox in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide.
