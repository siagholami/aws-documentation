Disabling users
You can disable a user's access by changing their status to Inactive.
To change user status to *Inactive*


From the admin control panel, under Manage Users, choose the pencil icon () next to the user's name.


Choose Inactive, and choose Save Changes


The inactivated user no longer has access to your Amazon WorkDocs site.
Note
Changing a user to Inactive status does not delete their files, folders, or feedback from your Amazon WorkDocs site. However, you can transfer files and folders to an active user. For more information, see Transferring document ownership.
Deleting pending users (Simple AD only)
You can only delete Simple AD users that are in Pending status. To delete one of these users, choose the trash can icon () next to the user's name.
Your Amazon WorkDocs site must always have at least one active user that is not a guest user. If you want to delete all users, you must delete your entire Amazon WorkDocs site.
We do not recommend that you delete registered users. Instead, you should switch a user from Active to Inactive status, so that they do not have access to your Amazon WorkDocs site.
