RegionOfInterest
Specifies a location within the frame that Rekognition checks for text. Uses a BoundingBox object to set a region of the screen.
A word is included in the region if the word is more than half in that region. If there is more than one region, the word will be compared with all regions of the screen. Any word more than half in a region is kept in the results.
