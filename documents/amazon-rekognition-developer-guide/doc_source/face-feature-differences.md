# Overview of Face Detection and Face Comparison<a name="face-feature-differences"></a>

There are two primary applications of machine learning that analyze images containing faces: face detection and face comparison\. A face detection system is designed to answer the question: is there a face in this picture? A face detection system determines the presence, location, scale, and \(possibly\) orientation of any face present in a still image or video frame\. This system is designed to detect the presence of faces regardless of attributes such as gender, age, and facial hair\. 

A face comparison system is designed to answer the question: does the face in an image match the face in another image? A face comparison system takes an image of a face and makes a prediction about whether the face matches other faces in a provided database\. Face comparison systems are designed to compare and predict potential matches of faces regardless of their expression, facial hair, and age\.

Both face detection and face comparison systems can provide an estimate of the confidence level of the prediction in the form of a probability or confidence score\. For example, a face detection system may predict that an image region is a face at a confidence score of 90%, and another image region is a face at a confidence score of 60%\. The region with the higher confidence score should be more likely to contain a face\. If a face detection system does not properly detect a face, or provides a low confidence prediction of an actual face, this is known as a missed detection or false negative\. If a facial detection system incorrectly predicts the presence of a face at a high confidence level, this is a false alarm or false positive\. Similarly, a facial comparison system may not match two faces belonging to the same person \(missed detection/false negative\), or may incorrectly predict that two faces from different people are the same person \(false alarm/false positive\)\.

Confidence scores are a critical component of face detection and comparison systems\. These systems make predictions of whether a face exists in an image or matches a face in another image, with a corresponding level of confidence in the prediction\. Users of these systems should consider the confidence score/similarity threshold provided by the system when designing their application and making decisions based on the output of the system\. For example, in a photo application used to identify similar looking family members, if the confidence threshold is set at 80%, then the application will return matches when predictions reach an 80% confidence level, but will not return matches below that level\. This threshold may be acceptable because the risk of missed detections or false alarms is low for this type of use case\. However, for use cases where the risk of missed detection or false alarm is higher, the system should use a higher confidence level\. You should use a 99% confidence/similarity threshold in scenarios where highly accurate facial matches are important\.
