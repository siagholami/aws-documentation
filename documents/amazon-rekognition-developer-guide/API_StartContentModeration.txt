StartContentModeration
Starts asynchronous detection of unsafe content in a stored video.
Amazon Rekognition Video can moderate content in a video stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Video to specify the bucket name and the filename of the video. StartContentModeration returns a job identifier (JobId) which you use to get the results of the analysis. When unsafe content analysis is finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in NotificationChannel.
To get the results of the unsafe content analysis, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetContentModeration and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartContentModeration.

Request Parameters
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 ClientRequestToken  
Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use the same token with multiple StartContentModeration requests, the same JobId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from being accidently started more than once. 
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]$ 
Required: No
 JobTag  
An identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notification that's published to your Amazon Simple Notification Service topic. For example, you can use JobTag to group related jobs and identify them in the completion notification.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9_.\-:] 
Required: No
 MinConfidence  
Specifies the minimum confidence that Amazon Rekognition must have in order to return a moderated content label. Confidence represents how certain Amazon Rekognition is that the moderated content is correctly identified. 0 is the lowest confidence. 100 is the highest confidence. Amazon Rekognition doesn't return any moderated content labels with a confidence level lower than this specified value. If you don't specify MinConfidence, GetContentModeration returns labels with confidence values greater than or equal to 50 percent.
Type: Float
Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 100.
Required: No
 NotificationChannel  
The Amazon SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon Rekognition Video to publish the completion status of the unsafe content analysis to.
Type: NotificationChannel object
Required: No
 Video  
The video in which you want to detect unsafe content. The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.
Type: Video object
Required: Yes

}
Response Elements
If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.
The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.
 JobId  
The identifier for the unsafe content analysis job. Use JobId to identify the job in a subsequent call to GetContentModeration.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]$ 
Errors
AccessDeniedException 
You are not authorized to perform the action.
HTTP Status Code: 400
IdempotentParameterMismatchException 
A ClientRequestToken input parameter was reused with an operation, but at least one of the other input parameters is different from the previous call to the operation.
HTTP Status Code: 400
InternalServerError 
Amazon Rekognition experienced a service issue. Try your call again.
HTTP Status Code: 500
InvalidParameterException

InvalidS3ObjectException 
Amazon Rekognition is unable to access the S3 object specified in the request.
HTTP Status Code: 400
LimitExceededException 
An Amazon Rekognition service limit was exceeded. For example, if you start too many Amazon Rekognition Video jobs concurrently, calls to start operations (StartLabelDetection, for example) will raise a LimitExceededException exception (HTTP status code: 400) until the number of concurrently running jobs is below the Amazon Rekognition service limit. 
HTTP Status Code: 400
ProvisionedThroughputExceededException 
The number of requests exceeded your throughput limit. If you want to increase this limit, contact Amazon Rekognition.
HTTP Status Code: 400
