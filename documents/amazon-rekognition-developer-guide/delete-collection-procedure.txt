   import com.amazonaws.services.rekognition.AmazonRekognitionClientBuilder;
   import com.amazonaws.services.rekognition.model.DeleteCollectionRequest;
   import com.amazonaws.services.rekognition.model.DeleteCollectionResult;
public class DeleteCollection {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

     AmazonRekognition rekognitionClient = AmazonRekognitionClientBuilder.defaultClient();

     String collectionId = "MyCollection";

     System.out.println("Deleting collections");

     DeleteCollectionRequest request = new DeleteCollectionRequest()
        .withCollectionId(collectionId);
     DeleteCollectionResult deleteCollectionResult = rekognitionClient.deleteCollection(request);
