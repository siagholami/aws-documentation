StartProjectVersion
Starts the running of the version of a model. Starting a model takes a while to complete. To check the current state of the model, use DescribeProjectVersions.
Once the model is running, you can detect custom labels in new images by calling DetectCustomLabels.
Note
You are charged for the amount of time that the model is running. To stop a running model, call StopProjectVersion.
This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:StartProjectVersion action.
