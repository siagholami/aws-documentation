Added support for resource groups that are configured for AWS services
You can now create resource groups that are associated with an AWS service and that configure how the service can interact with the resources that are in the group. In this first release of the feature, you can create a resource group that contains Amazon EC2 capacity reservations and then launch Amazon EC2 instances into the group. If there's capacity in one or more of the group's reservations that match your instance, then that instance uses the reservation. If the instance doesn't match any available reservations in the group, then it launches as an on-demand instance. For more information, see Working with capacity reservation groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

View operations data for AWS Resource Groups
In the AWS Systems Manager console, the AWS Resource Groups page displays operations data for a selected group on four tabs: Details, Config, CloudTrail, OpsItems. These tabs are not available when viewing a group in the Resource Groups console. You can use the information on these tabs to help you understand which resources in a group are compliant and working correctly and which resources require action. If you need to take action on a resource, you can use Systems Manager Automation runbooks to perform common operations maintenance and troubleshooting tasks. For more information, see Viewing operations data for AWS Resource Groups in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
