Consult your security best practices for how to proceed\. You might want to:

1. Provision a new certificate and attach it to the device\. 

1. Verify that the new certificate is valid and the device is able to use it to connect\.

1. Use [UpdateCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_UpdateCertificate.html) to mark the old certificate as INACTIVE in AWS IoT\. You can also use mitigation actions to:
   + Apply the `UPDATE_DEVICE_CERTIFICATE` mitigation action on your audit findings to make this change\. 
   + Apply the `ADD_THINGS_TO_THING_GROUP` mitigation action to add the device to a group where you can take action on it\.
   + Apply the `PUBLISH_FINDINGS_TO_SNS` mitigation action if you want to implement a custom response in response to the Amazon SNS message\. 

   For more information, see [Mitigation actions](device-defender-mitigation-actions.md)\. 

1. Detach the old certificate from the device\. \(See [DetachThingPrincipal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_DetachThingPrincipal.html)\.\)
