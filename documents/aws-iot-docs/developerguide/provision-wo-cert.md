# Provisioning devices that don't have device certificates using fleet provisioning<a name="provision-wo-cert"></a>

By using AWS IoT fleet provisioning, AWS IoT can generate and securely deliver device certificates and private keys to your devices when they connect to AWS IoT for the first time\.

There are two ways to use fleet provisioning:
+ By claim
+ By trusted user

## Provisioning by claim<a name="claim-based"></a>

Devices can be manufactured with a provisioning claim certificate and private key \(which are special purpose credentials\) embedded in them\. If these certificates are registered with AWS IoT, the service can exchange them for unique device certificates that the device can use for regular operations\. This process includes the following steps:

**Before you deliver the device**

1. Call [ `CreateProvisioningTemplate`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_CreateProvisioningTemplate.html) to create a provisioning template\. This API returns a template ARN\. For more information, see [Device provisioning MQTT API](fleet-provision-api.md)\.

   You can also create a fleet provisioning template in the AWS IoT console\. 

   1. From the navigation pane, choose **Onboard**, then choose **Fleet provisioning templates**\.

   1. Choose **Create** and follow the prompts\.

1. Create certificates and associated private keys to be used as provisioning claim certificates\.

1. Register these certificates with AWS IoT and associate an IoT policy that restricts the use of the certificates\. The following example IoT policy restricts the use of the certificate associated with this policy to provisioning devices\.

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": ["iot:Connect"],
               "Resource": "*"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": ["iot:Publish","iot:Receive"],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:topic/$aws/certificates/create/*",
                   "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:topic/$aws/provisioning-templates/templateName/provision/*"
               ]
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "iot:Subscribe",
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:topicfilter/$aws/certificates/create/*",
                   "arn:aws:iot:aws-region:aws-account-id:topicfilter/$aws/provisioning-templates/templateName/provision/*"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. Give the AWS IoT service permission to create or update IoT resources such as things and certificates in your account when provisioning devices\. Do this by attaching the `AWSIoTThingsRegistration` managed policy to an IAM role \(called the provisioning role\) that trusts the AWS IoT service principal\.

1. Manufacture the device with the provisioning claim certificate securely embedded in it\.

The device is now ready to be delivered to where it will be installed for use\.

**Important**  
Provisioning claim private keys should be secured at all times, including on the device\. We recommend that you use AWS IoT CloudWatch metrics and logs to monitor for indications of misuse\. If you detect misuse, disable the provisioning claim certificate so it cannot be used for device provisioning\.

**To initialize the device for use**

1. The device uses the [AWS IoT Device and Mobile SDKs](iot-sdks.md) to connect to and authenticate with AWS IoT using the provisioning claim certificate that is installed on the device\.

1. The device obtains a permanent certificate and private key by using one of these options\. The device will use the certificate and key for all future authentication with AWS IoT\.

   1. Call [ `CreateKeysAndCertificate`](fleet-provision-api.md#create-keys-cert) to create a new certificate and private key using the AWS certificate authority\.

      Or

   1. Call [ `CreateCertificateFromCsr`](fleet-provision-api.md#create-cert-csr) to generate a certificate from a certificate signing request that keeps its private key secure\.

1. From the device, call [`RegisterThing`](fleet-provision-api.md#register-thing) to register the device with AWS IoT and create cloud resources\.

   The Fleet Provisioning service creates cloud resources such as things, thing groups, and attributes, as defined in the provisioning template\.

1. After saving the permanent certificate on the device, the device must disconnect from the session that it initiated with the provisioning claim certificate and reconnect using the permanent certificate\. 

The device is now ready to communicate normally with AWS IoT\.

## Provisioning by trusted user<a name="trusted-user"></a>

In many cases, a device connects to AWS IoT for the first time when a trusted user, such as an end user or installation technician, uses a mobile app to configure the device in its deployed location\.

**Important**  
You must manage the trusted user's access and permission to perform this procedure\. One way to do this is to provide and maintain an account for the trusted user that authenticates them and grants them access to the AWS IoT features and APIs required to perform this procedure\. 

**Before you deliver the device**

1. Call [ `CreateProvisioningTemplate`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_CreateProvisioningTemplate.html) to create a provisioning template and return its *templateArn* and *templateName*\.

1. Create an IAM role that is used by a trusted user to initiate the provisioning process\. The provisioning template allows only that user to provision a device\. For example:

   ```
   {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": [
           "iot:CreateProvisioningClaim",
       ],
       "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:aws-region:aws-account-id:provisioningtemplate/templateName"
       ]
   }
   ```

1. Give the AWS IoT service permission to create or update IoT resources, such as things and certificates in your account when provisioning devices\. You do this by attaching the `AWSIoTThingsRegistration` managed policy to an IAM role \(called the *provisioning role*\) that trusts the AWS IoT service principal\.

1. Provide the means to identify your trusted users, such as by providing them with an account that can authenticate them and authorize their interactions with the AWS APIs necessary to register their devices\.

**To initialize the device for use**

1. A trusted user signs in to your provisioning mobile app or web service\.

1. The mobile app or web application uses the IAM role and calls [ `CreateProvisioningClaim`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_CreateProvisioningClaim.html) to obtain a temporary provisioning claim certificate from AWS IoT\.
**Note**  
For security, the temporary provisioning claim certificate returned by `CreateProvisioningClaim` is valid for only five minutes\. The following steps must successfully return a valid certificate before the temporary provisioning claim certificate expires\. Temporary provisioning claim certificates do not appear in your account's list of certificates\.

1. The mobile app or web application supplies the temporary provisioning claim certificate to the device along with any required configuration information, such as Wi\-Fi credentials\.

1. The device uses the temporary provisioning claim certificate to connect to AWS IoT using the [AWS IoT Device and Mobile SDKs](iot-sdks.md)\.
**Note**  
The device must perform the following steps such that it calls [`RegisterThing`](fleet-provision-api.md#register-thing) within five minutes of connecting to AWS IoT with the temporary provisioning claim certificate\.

1. The device obtains a permanent certificate and private key by using one of these options\. The device will use the certificate and key for all future authentication with AWS IoT\.

   1. Call [ `CreateKeysAndCertificate`](fleet-provision-api.md#create-keys-cert) to create a new certificate and private key using the AWS certificate authority\.

      Or

   1. Call [ `CreateCertificateFromCsr`](fleet-provision-api.md#create-cert-csr) to generate a certificate from a certificate signing request that keeps its private key secure\.

1. The device calls [`RegisterThing`](fleet-provision-api.md#register-thing) to register the device with AWS IoT and create cloud resources\. Remember that this must occur within five minutes of connecting to AWS IoT with the temporary provisioning claim certificate\.

   The Fleet Provisioning service creates cloud resources such as IoT things, thing groups, and attributes, as defined in the provisioning template\.

1. After saving the permanent certificate on the device, the device must disconnect from the session that it initiated with the temporary provisioning claim certificate and reconnect using the permanent certificate\. 

The device is now ready to communicate normally with AWS IoT\.

## Using pre\-provisioning hooks with the AWS CLI<a name="hooks-cli-instruc"></a>

The following procedure creates a provisioning template with pre\-provisioning hooks\. The Lambda function used here is an example that can be modified\. 

**To create and apply a pre\-provisioning hook to a provisioning template**

1. Create a Lambda function that has a defined input and output\. Lambda functions are highly customizable the `allowProvisioning` and `parameterOverrides` are required for creating pre\-provisioning hooks\. For more information about creating Lambda functions, see [Using AWS Lambda with the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-awscli.html)\.

   The following is an example of a Lambda function output:

   ```
   {
     "allowProvisioning": True,
     "parameterOverrides": {
       "incomingKey0": "incomingValue0",
       "incomingKey1": "incomingValue1"
     }
   }
   ```

1. AWS IoT uses resource\-based policies to call Lambda, so you must give AWS IoT permission to call your Lambda function\.

   The following is an example using [add\-permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/add-permission.html) give IoT permission to your Lambda\.

   ```
   aws lambda add-permission \
       --function-name myLambdaFunction \
       --statement-id iot-permission \
       --action lambda:InvokeFunction \
       --principal iot.amazonaws.com
   ```

1. Add a pre\-provisioning hook to a template using either the [create\-provisioning\-template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iot/create-provisioning-template.html) or [update\-provisioning\-template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iot/update-provisioning-template.html) command\.

   The following CLI example uses the [create\-provisioning\-template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iot/create-provisioning-template.html) to create a provisioning template that has pre\-provisioning hooks:

   ```
   aws iot create-provisioning template \
       --template-name myTemplate \
       --provisioning-role-arn arn:aws:iam:us-east-1:1234564789012:role/myRole \
       --template-body file://template.json \
       --pre-provisioning-hook file://hooks.json
   ```

   The output of this command looks like the following:

   ```
   {
       "templateArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:1234564789012:provisioningtemplate/myTemplate",
       "defaultVersionId": 1,
       "templateName": myTemplate
   }
   ```

   You can also load a parameter from a file instead of typing it all as a command line parameter value to save time\. For more information, see [Loading AWS CLI Parameters from a File](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-file.html)\. The following shows the `template` parameter in expanded JSON format:

                   "Status" : "Active"
               }
           },
           "policy" : {
               "Type" : "AWS::IoT::Policy",
               "Properties" : {
                   "PolicyDocument" : {
                       "Version": "2012-10-17",
                       "Statement": [{
                           "Effect": "Allow",
                           "Action":["iot:Publish"],
                           "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:504350838278:topic/foo/bar"]
                       }]
                   }
               }
           }
       },
       "DeviceConfiguration": {
           "FallbackUrl": "https://www.example.com/test-site",
           "LocationUrl": {
               "Fn::FindInMap": ["LocationTable",{"Ref": "DeviceLocation"}, "LocationUrl"]}
       }
