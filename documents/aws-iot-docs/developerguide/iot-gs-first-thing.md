# Explore AWS IoT Core services in hands\-on tutorial<a name="iot-gs-first-thing"></a>

In this tutorial, you'll install the software and create the AWS IoT resources necessary to connect a device to AWS IoT so that it can send and receive MQTT messages with AWS IoT Core\. You'll see the messages in the MQTT client in the AWS IoT console\.

You can expect to spend 20\-30 minutes on this tutorial\. If you are using an IoT device or a Raspberry Pi, this tutorial might take longer if, for example, you need to install the operating system and configure the device\.

This tutorial is best for developers who want to get started with AWS IoT so they can continue to explore more advanced features, such as the rules engine and shadows\. This tutorial prepares you to continue learning about AWS IoT Core and how it interacts with other AWS services by explaining the steps in greater detail than the quick start tutorial\. If you are looking for just a quick, *Hello World*, experience, try the [Try the AWS IoT quick connect](iot-quick-start.md)\.

After setting up your AWS account and AWS IoT console, you'll follow these steps to see how to connect a device and have it send messages to AWS IoT\.
