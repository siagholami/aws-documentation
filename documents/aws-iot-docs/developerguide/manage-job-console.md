# Creating and managing jobs \(console\)<a name="manage-job-console"></a>

If you are using Code\-signing for AWS IoT, you must add two placeholder URLs in your job document:

A placeholder for the code file should look like this: `${aws:iot:s3-presigned-url:https://s3.amazonaws.com/<my-s3-bucket>/<my-code-file>}`\. 

**Note**  
Currently, versions are not supported for presigned URL placeholders for jobs\. If you update your code file and copy it to the same Amazon S3 location, you must create a new signature and then reference the new signature version in your job document\.

A placeholder for the signature should look like this: `${aws:iot:code-sign-signature:s3://<region>.<my-s3-bucket>/<my-code-file>@<code-file-version-id>}`\.

1. Create or choose a code\-signing profile\. If you are not code signing your update, you can skip this step\.

1. Under **Pre\-sign resource URLs**, choose **I want to pre\-sign my URLs and have configured my job file**\. If you are not code signing your update, you can skip this step\.

1. Under **Job type**, choose the appropriate option for your update, and then choose **Next**\.

1. Specify values for any advanced configurations, and then choose **Create**\.

After you create the job, the console generates a JSON signature and places it in your job document\.
