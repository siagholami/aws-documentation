# Configure your device<a name="configure-device"></a>

This section describes how to configure your device to connect to AWS IoT\. If you'd like to get started with AWS IoT but don't have a device yet, you can create a virtual device by using Amazon EC2 or you can use your Windows PC or Mac as an IoT device\.

Select the best device option for you to try AWS IoT\. Of course, you can try all of them, but try only one at a time\. If you're not sure which device option is best for you, read about how to choose [which device option is the best](iot-gs-first-thing.md#choosing-a-gs-system), and then return to this page\.
