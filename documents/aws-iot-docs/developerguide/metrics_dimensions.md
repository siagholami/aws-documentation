# AWS IoT metrics and dimensions<a name="metrics_dimensions"></a>

When you interact with AWS IoT, the service sends the following metrics and dimensions to CloudWatch every minute\. You can use the following procedures to view the metrics for AWS IoT\.

**To view metrics \(CloudWatch console\)**

Metrics are grouped first by the service namespace, and then by the various dimension combinations within each namespace\.

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**\.

1. In the **CloudWatch Metrics by Category** pane, under the metrics category for AWS IoT, choose a metrics category, and then in the upper pane, scroll down to view the full list of metrics\.

**To view metrics \(CLI\)**
+ At a command prompt, use the following command:

  ```
  1. aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/IoT"
  ```
