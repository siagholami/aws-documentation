# Dynamic thing groups<a name="dynamic-thing-groups"></a>

Dynamic thing groups update group membership through search queries\. Using dynamic thing groups, you can change the way you interact with things depending on their connectivity, registry, or shadow data\.

Because dynamic thing groups are tied to your fleet index, you must enable the fleet indexing service to use them\. You can preview the things in a dynamic thing group before you create the group with a fleet indexing search query\. For more information, see [Fleet indexing service](iot-indexing.md) and [Query syntax](query-syntax.md)\.

You can specify a dynamic thing group as a target for a job\. Only things that meet the criteria that define the dynamic thing group perform the job\.

For example, suppose that you want to update the firmware on your devices, but, to minimize the chance that the update is interrupted, you only want to update firmware on devices with battery life greater than 80%\. You can create a dynamic thing group that only includes devices with a reported battery life above 80%, and you can use that dynamic thing group as the target for your firmware update job\. Only devices that meet your battery life criteria receive the firmware update\. As devices reach the 80% battery life criteria, they are added to the dynamic thing group and receive the firmware update\.

For more information about specifying thing groups as job targets, see [CreateJob](jobs-api.md#jobs-CreateJob)\.

Dynamic thing groups differ from static thing groups in the following ways:
+ Thing membership is not explicitly defined\. To create a dynamic thing group, you must define a query string that defines group membership\.
+ Dynamic thing groups cannot be part of a hierarchy\.
+ Dynamic thing groups cannot have policies applied to them\.
+ You use a different set of commands to create, update, and delete dynamic thing groups\. For all other operations, the same commands that you use to interact with static thing groups can be used to interact with dynamic thing groups\.
+ The number of dynamic groups that a single account can have is [limited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html#thing-group-limits)\.
+ You should not use personally identifiable information in your thing group name\. The thing group name can appear in unencrypted communications and reports\. 
+  You should not use a colon character \( : \) in a thing group name\. The colon character is used as a delimiter by other AWS IoT services and this can cause them to parse strings with thing group names incorrectly\. 

For more information about static thing groups, see [Static thing groups](thing-groups.md)\.

As an example, suppose we create a dynamic group that contains all rooms in a warehouse whose temperature is greater than 60 degrees Fahrenheit\. When a room's temperature is 61 degrees or higher, it is added to the RoomTooWarm dynamic thing group\. All rooms in the RoomTooWarm dynamic thing group have cooling fans turned on\. When a room's temperature falls to 60 degrees or lower, it is removed from the dynamic thing group and its fan would be turned off\.

## Create a dynamic thing group<a name="create-dynamic-thing-group"></a>

Use the CreateDynamicThingGroup command to create a dynamic thing group\. To create a dynamic thing group for the room too warm scenario you would use the create\-dynamic\-thing\-group CLI command:

```
$ aws iot create-dynamic-thing-group --thing-group-name "RoomTooWarm" --query-string "attributes.temperature>60"
```

**Note**  
We do not recommend using personally identifiable information in your dynamic thing group names\.

The CreateDynamicThingGroup command returns a response that contains the index name, query string, query version, thing group name, thing group ID, and thing group ARN:

```
{
    "indexName": "AWS_Things", 
    "queryVersion": "2017-09-30", 
    "thingGroupName": "RoomTooWarm", 
    "thingGroupArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thinggroup/RoomTooWarm", 
    "queryString": "attributes.temperature>60\n", 
    "thingGroupId": "abcdefgh12345678ijklmnop12345678qrstuvwx"
}
```

Dynamic thing group creation is not instantaneous\. The dynamic thing group backfill takes time to complete\. When a dynamic thing group is created, the status of the group is set to `BUILDING`\. When the backfill is complete, the status changes to `ACTIVE`\. To check the status of your dynamic thing group, use the [DescribeThingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_DescribeThingGroup.html) command\.

## Describe a dynamic thing group<a name="describe-dynamic-thing-group"></a>

Use the DescribeThingGroup command to get information about a dynamic thing group:

```
$ aws iot describe-thing-group --thing-group-name "RoomTooWarm"
```

The DescribeThingGroup command returns information about the specified group:

```
{
    "status": "ACTIVE", 
    "indexName": "AWS_Things", 
    "thingGroupName": "RoomTooWarm", 
    "thingGroupArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thinggroup/RoomTooWarm", 
    "queryString": "attributes.temperature>60\n", 
    "version": 1, 
    "thingGroupMetadata": {
        "creationDate": 1548716921.289
    }, 
    "thingGroupProperties": {}, 
    "queryVersion": "2017-09-30", 
    "thingGroupId": "84dd9b5b-2b98-4c65-84e4-be0e1ecf4fd8"
}
```

Running DescribeThingGroup on a dynamic thing group returns attributes that are specific to dynamic thing groups, such as the queryString and the status\.

The status of a dynamic thing group can take the following values:

`ACTIVE`  
The dynamic thing group is ready for use\.

`BUILDING`  
The dynamic thing group is being created, and thing membership is being processed\.

`REBUILDING`  
The dynamic thing group's membership is being updated, following the adjustment of the group's search query\.

**Note**  
After you create a dynamic thing group, you can use the group, regardless of its status\. Only dynamic thing groups with an `ACTIVE` status include all of the things that match the search query for that dynamic thing group\. Dynamic thing groups with `BUILDING` and `REBUILDING` statuses might not include all of the things that match the search query\. 

## Update a dynamic thing group<a name="update-dynamic-thing-group"></a>

Use the UpdateDynamicThingGroup command to update the attributes of a dynamic thing group, including the group's search query\. The following command updates the thing group description and the query string changing the membership criteria to temperature > 65:

```
$ aws iot update-dynamic-thing-group --thing-group-name "RoomTooWarm" --thing-group-properties "thingGroupDescription=\"This thing group contains rooms warmer than 65F.\"" --query-string "attributes.temperature>65"
```

The UpdateDynamicThingGroup command returns a response that contains the group's version number after the update:

```
{
    "version": 2
}
```

Dynamic thing group updates are not instantaneous\. The dynamic thing group backfill takes time to complete\. When a dynamic thing group is updated, the status of the group changes to `REBUILDING` while the group updates its membership\. When the backfill is complete, the status changes to `ACTIVE`\. To check the status of your dynamic thing group, use the [DescribeThingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_DescribeThingGroup.html) command\.

## Delete a dynamic thing group<a name="delete-dynamic-thing-group"></a>

Use the DeleteDynamicThingGroup command to delete a dynamic thing group:

```
$ aws iot delete-dynamic-thing-group --thing-group-name "RoomTooWarm"
```

The DeleteDynamicThingGroup command does not produce any output\.

  Commands that show which groups a thing belongs to \(for example, ListGroupsForThing\) might continue to show the group while records in the cloud are being updated\.

## Limitations and conflicts<a name="dynamic-thing-group-limitations"></a>

Dynamic thing groups share these limitations with static thing groups:
+ The number of attributes a thing group can have is [limited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html#thing-group-limits)\.
+ The number of groups to which a thing can belong is [limited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html#thing-limits)\.
+ Thing groups cannot be renamed\.
+ Thing group names cannot contain international characters, such as û, é, and ñ\.

When using dynamic thing groups, keep the following in mind\.

### The fleet indexing service must be enabled<a name="indexing-backfill-conflict"></a>

The fleet indexing service must be enabled and the fleet indexing backfill must be complete before you can create and use dynamic thing groups\. Expect a delay after you enable the fleet indexing service\. The backfill can take some time to complete\. The more things that you have registered, the longer the backfill process takes\. After you enable the fleet indexing service for dynamic thing groups, you cannot disable it until you delete all of your dynamic thing groups\.

**Note**  
If you have permissions to query the fleet index, you can access the data of things across the entire fleet\.

### The number of dynamic thing groups is limited<a name="dynamic-thing-groups-limited"></a>

The number of dynamic groups is [limited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html#thing-group-limits)\.

### Successful commands can log errors<a name="log-errors"></a>

When creating or updating a dynamic thing group, it's possible that some things might be eligible to be in a dynamic thing group yet not be added to it\. The command to create or update a dynamic thing group, however, still succeeds in those cases while logging an error and generating an [ `AddThingToDynamicThingGroupsFailed` metric](metrics_dimensions.md#iot-metrics)\. 

An [error log entry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/cwl-format.html#dynamic-group-logs) in the CloudWatch log is created for each thing when an eligible thing cannot be added to a dynamic thing group or a thing is removed from a dynamic thing group to add it to another group\. When a thing cannot be added to a dynamic group, an [ `AddThingToDynamicThingGroupsFailed` metric](metrics_dimensions.md#iot-metrics) is also created; however, a single metric can represent multiple log entries\.

When a thing becomes eligible to be added to a dynamic thing group, the following is considered:
+ Is the thing already in as many groups as it can be? \(See [limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html#thing-limits)\)
  + **NO: **The thing is added to the dynamic thing group\.
  + **YES:** Is the thing a member of any dynamic thing groups?
    + **NO:** The thing can't be added to the dynamic thing group, an error is logged, and an [ `AddThingToDynamicThingGroupsFailed` metric](metrics_dimensions.md#iot-metrics) is generated\.
    + **YES:** Is the dynamic thing group to join older than any dynamic thing group that the thing is already a member of?
      + **NO:** The thing can't be added to the dynamic thing group, an error is logged, and an [ `AddThingToDynamicThingGroupsFailed` metric](metrics_dimensions.md#iot-metrics) is generated\.
      + **YES:** Remove the thing from the most recent dynamic thing group it is a member of, log an error, and add the thing to the dynamic thing group\. This generates an error and an [ `AddThingToDynamicThingGroupsFailed` metric](metrics_dimensions.md#iot-metrics) for the dynamic thing group from which the thing was removed\.

When a thing in a dynamic thing group no longer meets the search query, it is removed from the dynamic thing group\. Likewise, when a thing is updated to meet a dynamic thing group's search query, it is then added to the group as previously described\. These additions and removals are normal and do not produce error log entries\. 

### With `overrideDynamicGroups` enabled, static groups take priority over dynamic groups<a name="membership-limit"></a>

The number of groups to which a thing can belong is [limited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html#thing-limits)\. When you update thing membership by using the [AddThingToThingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_AddThingToThingGroup.html) or [UpdateThingGroupsForThing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_UpdateThingGroupsForThing.html) commands, adding the `--overrideDynamicGroups` parameter gives static thing groups priority over dynamic thing groups\.

When adding a thing to a static thing group, the following is considered:
+ Does the thing already belong to the maximum number of groups?
  + **NO:** The thing is added to the static thing group\.
  + **YES:** Is the thing in any dynamic groups?
    + **NO:** The thing cannot be added to the thing group\. The command raises an exception\.
    + **YES:** Was \-\-overrideDynamicGroups enabled?
      + **NO:** The thing cannot be added to the thing group\. The command raises an exception\.
      + **YES:** The thing is removed from the most recently created dynamic thing group, an error is logged, and an [ `AddThingToDynamicThingGroupsFailed` metric](metrics_dimensions.md#iot-metrics) is generated for the dynamic thing group from which the thing was removed\. Then, the thing is added to the static thing group\.

### Older dynamic thing groups take priority over newer ones<a name="group-priorities"></a>

The number of groups to which a thing can belong is [limited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html#thing-limits)\. When a thing becomes eligible to be added to a dynamic thing group beca a create or update operation, and the thing is already in as many groups as it can be, it can be removed from another dynamic thing group to enable this addition\. For more information about how this occurs, see [Successful commands can log errors](#log-errors) and [With `overrideDynamicGroups` enabled, static groups take priority over dynamic groups](#membership-limit) for examples\.

When a thing is removed from a dynamic thing group, an error is logged, and an event is raised\.

### You cannot apply policies to dynamic thing groups<a name="apply-policy"></a>

 Attempting to apply a policy to a dynamic thing group generates an exception\. 

### Dynamic thing group membership is eventually consistent<a name="update-conflict"></a>

Only the final state of a thing is evaluated for the registry\. Intermediary states can be skipped if states are updated rapidly\. Avoid associating a rule or job, with a dynamic thing group whose membership depends on an intermediary state\.
