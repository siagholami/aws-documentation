# Data protection in AWS IoT Core<a name="data-protection"></a>

AWS IoT conforms to the AWS [shared responsibility model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/), which includes regulations and guidelines for data protection\. AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all the AWS services\. AWS maintains control over data hosted on this infrastructure, including the security configuration controls for handling customer content and personal data\. AWS customers and APN partners, acting either as data controllers or data processors, are responsible for any personal data that they put in the AWS Cloud\. 

For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect AWS account credentials and set up individual user accounts with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\), so that each user is given only the permissions required to fulfill their job duties\. We also recommend that you secure your data in the following ways:
+ Use multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) with each account\.
+ Use SSL/TLS to communicate with AWS resources\.
+ Set up API and user activity logging with AWS CloudTrail\.
+ Use AWS encryption solutions, along with all default security controls in AWS services\.
+ Use advanced managed security services such as Amazon Macie, which assists in discovering and securing personal data that is stored in Amazon S3\.

We strongly recommend that you never put sensitive identifying information, such as your customers' account numbers, into free\-form fields such as a **Name** field\. This includes when you work with AWS IoT or other AWS services using the console, API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs\. Any data that you enter into AWS IoT or other services might get picked up for inclusion in diagnostic logs\. When you provide a URL to an external server, don't include credentials information in the URL to validate your request to that server\.

For more information about data protection, see the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model and GDPR](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/the-aws-shared-responsibility-model-and-gdpr/) blog post on the *AWS Security Blog*\.

AWS IoT devices gather data, perform some manipulation on that data, and then send that data to another web service\. You might choose to store some data on your device for a short period of time\. You are responsible for providing any data protection on that data at rest\. When your device sends data to AWS IoT it does so over a TLS connection as discussed later in this section\. AWS IoT devices can send data to any AWS service\. For more information about each service's data security, see the documentation for that service\. AWS IoT can be configured to write logs to CloudWatch Logs and log AWS IoT API calls to AWS CloudTrail\. For more information about data security for these services, see [ Authentication and Access Control for Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/auth-and-access-control-cw.html) and [Encrypting CloudTrail Log Files with AWS KMS\-Managed Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/encrypting-cloudtrail-log-files-with-aws-kms.html)\.
