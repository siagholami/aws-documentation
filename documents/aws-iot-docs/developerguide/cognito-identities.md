# Amazon Cognito identities<a name="cognito-identities"></a>

Amazon Cognito Identity enables you to create temporary, limited\-priviledge AWS credentials for use in mobile and web applications\. When you use Amazon Cognito Identity, you create identity pools that create unique identities for your users and authenticate them with identity providers like Login with Amazon, Facebook, and Google\. You can also use Amazon Cognito identities with your own developer authenticated identities\. For more information, see [ Amazon Cognito Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html)\.

To use Amazon Cognito Identity, you define a Amazon Cognito identity pool that is associated with an IAM role\. The IAM role is associated with an IAM policy that grants identities from your identity pool permission to access AWS resources like calling AWS services\.

Amazon Cognito Identity creates unauthenticated and authenticated identities\. Unauthenticated identities are used for guest users in a mobile or web application who want to use the app without signing in\. Unauthenticated users are granted only those permissions specified in the IAM policy associated with the identity pool\.

When you use authenticated identities, in addition to the IAM policy attached to the identity pool, you can attach an AWS IoT policy to an Amazon Cognito Identity using the [ AttachPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_AttachPolicy.html) API and give fine\-grained permissions to an individual user of your AWS IoT application\. In this way, you can assign permissions for specific customers and their devices\. For more information about creating policies for Amazon Cognito identities, see [Publish/Subscribe policy examples](pub-sub-policy.md)\.
