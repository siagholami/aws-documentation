# Connecting to AWS IoT Core service endpoints<a name="iot-connect-service"></a>

You can access the features that the AWS IoT Core services provide by using the AWS CLI, the AWS SDK for your preferred language, or by calling the REST API directly\. We recommend using the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK to interact with AWS IoT Core because they incorporate the best practices for calling AWS services\. Calling the REST APIs directly is an option, but you must provide [the necessary security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) that enable access to the API\.

**Note**  
IoT devices should use [AWS IoT Device SDKs](iot-connect-devices.md#iot-connect-device-sdks)\. The Device SDKs are optimized for use on devices, support MQTT communication with AWS IoT, and support the AWS IoT APIs most used by devices\. For more information about the Device SDKs and the features they provide, see [AWS IoT Device SDKs](iot-connect-devices.md#iot-connect-device-sdks)\.  
Mobile devices should use [AWS Mobile SDKs](#iot-connect-mobile-sdks)\. The Mobile SDKs provide support for AWS IoT APIs, MQTT device communications, and the APIs of other AWS services on mobile devices\. For more information about the Mobile SDKs and the features they provide, see [AWS Mobile SDKs](#iot-connect-mobile-sdks)\.

The following sections describe the tools and SDKs that you can use to develop and interact with AWS IoT and other AWS services\. For the complete list of AWS tools and development kits that are available to build and manage apps on AWS, see [Tools to Build on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)\.

## REST APIs of the AWS IoT Core services<a name="iot-connect-rest"></a>

The REST APIs of the AWS IoT Core services can be called directly by using HTTP requests\.
+ 

**Endpoint URL**  
The service endpoints that expose the REST APIs of the AWS IoT Core services vary by Region and are listed in [AWS IoT Core Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html)\. You must use the endpoint for the Region that has the AWS IoT resources that you want to access, because AWS IoT resources are Region specific\.
+ 

**Authentication**  
The REST APIs of the AWS IoT Core services use AWS IAM credentials for authentication\. For more information, see [Signing AWS API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the AWS General Reference\.
+ 

**API reference**  
For information about the specific functions provided by the REST APIs of the AWS IoT Core services, see:
  + [API reference for IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_Operations_AWS_IoT.html)\.
  + [API reference for IoT data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_Operations_AWS_IoT_Data_Plane.html)\.
