# Transport security in AWS IoT<a name="transport-security"></a>

The AWS IoT message broker and Device Shadow service encrypt all communication with [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) [version 1\.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_1.2)\. TLS is used to ensure the confidentiality of the application protocols \(MQTT, HTTP\) supported by AWS IoT\. TLS support is available in a number of programming languages and operating systems\.

For MQTT, TLS encrypts the connection between the device and the broker\. TLS client authentication is used by AWS IoT to identify devices\. For HTTP, TLS encrypts the connection between the device and the broker\. Authentication is delegated to AWS Signature Version 4\. 

AWS IoT requires devices to send the [Server Name Indication \(SNI\) extension](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3546#section-3.1) to the Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) protocol and provide the complete endpoint address in the `host_name` field\. The `host_name` field must contain the endpoint you are calling, and it must be:
+ The `endpointAddress` returned by aws iot [describe\-endpoint](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iot/describe-endpoint.html) \-\-endpoint\-type iot:Data\-ATS

  or
+ The `domainName` returned by aws iot [describe\-domain\-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iot/describe-domain-configuration.html) â€“\-domain\-configuration\-name "*domain\_configuration\_name*"

Connections attempted by devices without the correct `host_name` value will be refused and logged in CloudWatch\.
