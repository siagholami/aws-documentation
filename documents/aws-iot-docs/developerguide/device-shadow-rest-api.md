# Device Shadow REST API<a name="device-shadow-rest-api"></a>

A shadow exposes the following URI for updating state information:

```
https://endpoint/things/thingName/shadow
```

The endpoint is specific to your AWS account\. To find your endpoint, you can:
+ Use the [describe\-endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iot/describe-endpoint.html) command from the AWS CLI\.
+ Use the AWS IoT console settings\. In **Settings**, the endpoint is listed under **Custom endpoint**
+ Use the AWS IoT console thing details\. Open **Manage**\. Under **Manage**, choose **Things** and, in the list of things, select and open a thing\. In the left nav of the Thing detail page, choose **Interact** and view the endpoint URI in the **HTTPS** section of the page\.

The format of the endpoint is as follows:

```
identifier.iot.region.amazonaws.com
```

The shadow REST API follows the same HTTPS protocols/port mappings as described in [Device communication protocols](protocols.md)\.

      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iot:GetThingShadow",

    }
  ]
}
