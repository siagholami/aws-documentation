# SNS<a name="sns-rule-action"></a>

The SNS \(`sns`\) action sends the data from an MQTT message as an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) push notification\.

You can follow a tutorial that shows you how to create and test a rule with an SNS action\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon SNS rule](iot-sns-rule.md)\.

## Requirements<a name="sns-rule-action-requirements"></a>

This rule action has the following requirements:
+ An IAM role that AWS IoT can assume to perform the `sns:Publish` operation\. For more information, see [Granting AWS IoT the required access](iot-create-role.md)\.

  In the AWS IoT console, you can choose or create a role to allow AWS IoT to perform this rule action\.
+ If you use an AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) customer managed key \(CMK\) to encrypt data at rest in Amazon SNS, the service must have permission to use the CMK on the caller's behalf\. For more information, see [Key management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-key-management.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*\.

## Parameters<a name="sns-rule-action-parameters"></a>

When you create an AWS IoT rule with this action, you must specify the following information:

`targetArn`  
The SNS topic or individual device to which the push notification is sent\.  
Supports substitution templates: API and AWS CLI only

`messageFormat`  
\(Optional\) The message format\. Amazon SNS uses this setting to determine if the payload should be parsed and if relevant platform\-specific parts of the payload should be extracted\. Valid values: `JSON`, `RAW`\. Defaults to `RAW`\.  
Supports substitution templates: No

`roleArn`  
The IAM role that allows access to SNS\. For more information, see [Requirements](#sns-rule-action-requirements)\.  
Supports substitution templates: No

## Examples<a name="sns-rule-action-examples"></a>

The following JSON example defines an SNS action in an AWS IoT rule\.

```
{
    "topicRulePayload": {
        "sql": "SELECT * FROM 'some/topic'", 
        "ruleDisabled": false, 
        "awsIotSqlVersion": "2016-03-23",
        "actions": [
            {
                "sns": {
                    "targetArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:my_sns_topic", 
                    "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws_iot_sns"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The following JSON example defines an SNS action with substitution templates in an AWS IoT rule\.

        "ruleDisabled": false,
        "awsIotSqlVersion": "2016-03-23",
        "actions": [
            {

                    "targetArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:${topic()}",
                    "messageFormat": "JSON",
                    "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws_iot_sns"
                }
            }
        ]
