# Certificate policy examples<a name="certificate-policy-examples"></a>

For devices registered in AWS IoT Core registry, the following policy grants permission to connect to AWS IoT Core with a client ID that matches a thing name, and to publish to a topic whose name is equal to the `certificateId` of the certificate the device used to authenticate itself:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:topic/${iot:CertificateId}"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Connect"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}"]
        }
    ]
}
```

For devices not registered in the AWS IoT Core registry, the following policy grants permission to connect to AWS IoT Core with client IDs, `client1`, `client2`, and `client3` and to publish to a topic whose name is equal to the `certificateId` of the certificate the device used to authenticate itself:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:topic/${iot:CertificateId}"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Connect"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client1",
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client2",
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client3"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

For devices registered in AWS IoT Core registry, the following policy grants permission to connect to AWS IoT Core with a client ID that matches the thing name, and to publish to a topic whose name is equal to the subject's `CommonName` field of the certificate the device used to authenticate itself:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:topic/${iot:Certificate.Subject.CommonName}"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Connect"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}"]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Note**  
In this example, the certificate's subject common name is used as the topic identifier, with the assumption that the subject common name is unique for each registered certificate\. If the certificates are shared across multiple devices, the subject common name is the same for all the devices that share this certificate, thereby allowing publish privileges to the same topic from multiple devices \(not recommended\)\.

For devices not registered in AWS IoT Core registry, the following policy grants permission to connect to AWS IoT Core with client IDs, `client1`, `client2`, and `client3` and to publish to a topic whose name is equal to the subject's `CommonName` field of the certificate the device used to authenticate itself:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:topic/${iot:Certificate.Subject.CommonName}"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Connect"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client1",
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client2",
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client3"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Note**  
In this example, the certificate's subject common name is used as the topic identifier, with the assumption that the subject common name is unique for each registered certificate\. If the certificates are shared across multiple devices, the subject common name is the same for all the devices that share this certificate, thereby allowing publish privileges to the same topic from multiple devices \(not recommended\)\.

For devices registered in the AWS IoT Core registry, the following policy grants permission to connect to AWS IoT Core with a client ID that matches the thing name, and to publish to a topic whose name is prefixed with `admin/` when the certificate used to authenticate the device has its `Subject.CommonName.2` field set to `Administrator`:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Connect"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:topic/admin/*"],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "iot:Certificate.Subject.CommonName.2": "Administrator"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

For devices not registered in AWS IoT Core registry, the following policy grants permission to connect to AWS IoT Core with client IDs `client1`, `client2`, and `client3` and to publish to a topic whose name is prefixed with `admin/` when the certificate used to authenticate the device has its `Subject.CommonName.2` field set to `Administrator`:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Connect"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client1",
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client2",
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client3"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:topic/admin/*"],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "iot:Certificate.Subject.CommonName.2": "Administrator"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

For devices registered in AWS IoT Core registry, the following policy allows a device to use its thing name to publish on a specific topic that consists of `admin/` followed by the `ThingName` when the certificate used to authenticate the device has any one of its `Subject.CommonName` fields set to `Administrator`:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Connect"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:topic/admin/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}"],
            "Condition": {
                "ForAnyValue:StringEquals": {
                    "iot:Certificate.Subject.CommonName.List": "Administrator"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

For devices not registered in AWS IoT Core registry, the following policy grants permission to connect to AWS IoT Core with client IDs `client1`, `client2`, and `client3` and to publish to the topic `admin` when the certificate used to authenticate the device has any one of its `Subject.CommonName` fields set to `Administrator`:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Connect"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client1",
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client2",
                "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:client/client3"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:topic/admin"],
            "Condition": {
                "ForAnyValue:StringEquals": {
                    "iot:Certificate.Subject.CommonName.List": "Administrator"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
