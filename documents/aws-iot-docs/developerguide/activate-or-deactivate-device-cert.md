# Activate or deactivate a client certificate<a name="activate-or-deactivate-device-cert"></a>

AWS IoT verifies that a client certificate is active when it authenticates a connection\.

You can create and register client certificates without activating them so they can't be used until you want to use them\. You can also deactivate active client certificates to disable them temporarily\. Finally, you can revoke client certificates to prevent them from any future use\.
