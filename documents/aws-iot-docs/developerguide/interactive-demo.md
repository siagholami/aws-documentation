# Try the AWS IoT Core interactive demo<a name="interactive-demo"></a>

The interactive demo shows the components of a simple IoT solution built on AWS IoT and how they interact with AWS IoT Core services\. It does not create any AWS IoT resources nor does it require that you download any software or do any coding\.

You can expect to spend about 10 minutes with this demo\. The tile in the console says that it takes 5 minutes, and you can probably do it in 5 minutes, but 10 minutes will give you time to explore each of the different steps more thoroughly\.

**To run the AWS IoT Core interactive demo**

1. Open your [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home) and from the left menu, choose **Learn**\.
