# AWS IoT Core policy variables<a name="iot-policy-variables"></a>

AWS IoT Core defines policy variables that can be used in AWS IoT Core policies in the `Resource` or `Condition` block\. When a policy is evaluated, the policy variables are replaced by actual values\. For example, if a device is connected to the AWS IoT Core message broker with a client ID of 100\-234\-3456, the `iot:ClientId` policy variable is replaced in the policy document by 100\-234\-3456\. For more information about policy variables, see [IAM Policy Variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html) and [Multi\-Value Conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_multi-value-conditions.html)\.
