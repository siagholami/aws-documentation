# AWS IoT security<a name="iot-security"></a>

Each connected device or client must have a credential to interact with AWS IoT\. All traffic to and from AWS IoT is sent securely over Transport Layer Security \(TLS\)\. AWS cloud security mechanisms protect data as it moves between AWS IoT and other AWS services\.

+ You are responsible for managing device credentials \(X\.509 certificates, AWS credentials, Amazon Cognito identities, federated identities, or custom authentication tokens\) and policies in AWS IoT\. For more information, see [Key management in AWS IoT](key-management.md)\. You are responsible for assigning unique identities to each device and managing the permissions for each device or group of devices\.
+ Your devices connect to AWS IoT using X\.509 certificates or Amazon Cognito identities over a secure TLS connection\. During research and development, and for some applications that make API calls or use WebSockets, you can also authenticate using IAM users and groups or custom authentication tokens\. For more information, see [IAM users, groups, and roles](iam-users-groups-roles.md)\.
+ When using AWS IoT authentication, the message broker is responsible for authenticating your devices, securely ingesting device data, and granting or denying access permissions you specify for your devices using AWS IoT policies\.
+ When using custom authentication, a custom authorizer is responsible for authenticating your devices and granting or denying access permissions you specify for your devices using AWS IoT or IAM policies\.
+ The AWS IoT rules engine forwards device data to other devices or other AWS services according to rules you define\. It uses AWS Identity and Access Management to securely transfer data to its final destination\. For more information, see [Identity and access management for AWS IoT](security-iam.md)\.
