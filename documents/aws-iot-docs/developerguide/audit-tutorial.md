## Prerequisites<a name="audit-tutorial-prerequisites"></a>

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:
+ An AWS account\. If you don't have this, see [Setting up](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/dd-setting-up.html)\.

## Enable audit checks<a name="audit-tutorial-enable-checks"></a>

In the following procedure, you enable audit checks that look at account and device settings and policies to ensure security measures are in place\. In this tutorial we instruct you to enable all audit checks, but you're able to select whichever checks you wish\.

Audit pricing is per device count per month \(fleet devices connected to AWS IoT\)\. Therefore, adding or removing audit checks would not affect your monthly bill when using this feature\.

1. In the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot), in the navigation pane, expand **Defend** and select **Get started with an audit**\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/audit-findings.png)

1. Use the question marks for guidance on how to make your non\-compliant checks compliant\. For example, you can follow [Enable logging \(optional\)](#enable-logging) to make the "Logging disabled" check compliant\.

## Creating audit mitigation actions<a name="audit-tutorial-mitigation"></a>

In the following procedure, you will create a AWS IoT Device Defender Audit Mitigation Action to enable AWS IoT logging\. Each audit check has mapped mitigation actions that will affect which **Action type** you choose for the audit check you want to fix\. For more information, see [Mitigation actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-defender-mitigation-actions.html#defender-audit-apply-mitigation-actions.html)\.

**To use the AWS IoT console to create mitigation actions**

1. Open the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home)\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Defend**, and then choose **Mitigation Actions**\.

1. On the **Mitigation Actions** page, choose **Create**\.

1. On the **Create a Mitigation Action** page, in **Action name**, enter a unique name for your mitigation action such as *EnableErrorLoggingAction*\.

1. In **Action type**, choose **Enable IoT logging**\.

1. In **Action execution role**, select **Create Role**\. For **Name**, use *IoTMitigationActionErrorLoggingRole*\. Then, choose **Create role**\.

1. In **Parameters**, under **Role for logging**, select AWSIoTLoggingRole\. For **Log level**, choose Error\.
