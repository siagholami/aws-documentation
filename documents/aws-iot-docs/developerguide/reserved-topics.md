# Reserved topics<a name="reserved-topics"></a>

Topics that begin with a dollar sign \($\) are reserved for use by AWS IoT\. You can subscribe and publish to these reserved topics as they allow; however, you can't create new topics that begin with a dollar sign\. Unsupported publish or subscribe operations to reserved topics can result in a terminated connection\.
