### Install the AWS IoT Device SDK for JavaScript<a name="gs-pc-node-intall-sdk"></a>

**To install the AWS IoT Device SDK for JavaScript on your computer**

1. Install aws\-crt, the common runtime library\.

   ```
   npm install aws-crt
   ```

1. Install v2 of the AWS IoT Device SDK for JavaScript\.

   ```
   npm install aws-iot-device-sdk-v2
   ```

1. Clone the AWS IoT Device SDK for JavaScript repository into the aws\-iot\-device\-sdk\-js\-v2 directory of your home directory\. This procedure refers to the base directory for the files to install as *home*\.

   The actual location of the *home* directory depends on your operating system\.

------
#### [ Linux/macOS ]

   In macOS and Linux, the *home* directory is `~`\.

   ```
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2.git
   ```

------
#### [ Windows ]

   In Windows, you can find the *home* directory path by running this command in the `cmd` window\.

   ```
   echo %USERPROFILE%
   cd %USERPROFILE%
   git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2.git
   ```

------

1. Change to the `aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2` directory that was created in the preceding step\.

   ```
   cd aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2
   ```

### Prepare to run the sample applications<a name="gs-pc-node-config-app"></a>

**To prepare your system to run the sample application**
+ Create the `certs` directory\. Into the `certs` directory, copy the private key, device certificate, and root CA certificate files you saved when you created and registered the thing object in [Create AWS IoT resources](create-iot-resources.md)\. The file names of each file in the destination directory should match those in the table\.

   The commands in the next section assume that your key and certificate files are stored on your device as shown in this table\.

------
#### [ Linux/macOS ]

  Run this command to create the `certs` subdirectory that you'll use when you run the sample applications\.

  ```
  mkdir ~/certs
  ```

  Into the new subdirectory, copy the files to the destination file paths shown in the following table\.  
**Certificate file names**    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/using-laptop-as-device.html)

  Run this command to list the files in the `certs` directory and compare them to those listed in the table\.

  ```
  ls -l ~/certs
  ```

------
#### [ Windows ]

  Run this command to create the `certs` subdirectory that you'll use when you run the sample applications\.

  ```
  mkdir %USERPROFILE%\certs
  ```

  Into the new subdirectory, copy the files to the destination file paths shown in the following table\.  
**Certificate file names**    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/using-laptop-as-device.html)

  Run this command to list the files in the `certs` directory and compare them to those listed in the table\.

  ```
  dir %USERPROFILE%\certs
  ```

------

## Install and run the sample application<a name="gs-pc-node-app-run"></a>

In this section, you'll install and run the `pub-sub.js` sample app found in the `aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2/samples/node` directory of the AWS IoT Device SDK for JavaScript\. This app shows how your device uses the MQTT library to publish and subscribe to MQTT messages\.

The `pub-sub.js` sample app subscribes to a topic, `topic_1`, publishes 10 messages to that topic, and displays the messages as they're received from the message broker\. 

To run the `pub-sub.js` sample app, you need the following information: 


**Application parameter values**  

|  Parameter  |  Where to find the value  | 
| --- | --- | 
| your\-iot\-endpoint |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/using-laptop-as-device.html)  | 

The *your\-iot\-endpoint* value has a format of: `endpoint_id-ats.iot.region.amazonaws.com`, for example, `a3qj468EXAMPLE-ats.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`\. 

------
#### [ Linux/macOS ]

**To install and run the example app on Linux/macOS**

1. In your command line window, navigate to the `~/aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2/samples/node/pub_sub` directory that the SDK created and install the sample app by using these commands\.

   ```
   cd ~/aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2/samples/node/pub_sub
   npm install
   ```

1. In your command line window, replace *your\-iot\-endpoint* as indicated and run this command\. 

   ```
   node dist/index.js --topic topic_1 --root-ca ~/certs/Amazon-root-CA-1.pem --cert ~/certs/device.pem.crt --key ~/certs/private.pem.key --endpoint your-iot-endpoint
   ```

------
#### [ Windows ]

**To run the example app on a Windows PC**

1. In your command line window, navigate to the `%USERPROFILE%\aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2\samples\node\pub_sub` directory that the SDK created and install the sample app by using these commands\.

   ```
   cd %USERPROFILE%\aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2\samples\node\pub_sub
   npm install
   ```

1. In your command line window, replace *your\-iot\-endpoint* as indicated and run this command \.

   ```
   node dist\index.js --topic topic_1 --root-ca %USERPROFILE%\certs\Amazon-root-CA-1.pem --cert %USERPROFILE%\certs\device.pem.crt --key %USERPROFILE%\certs\private.pem.key --endpoint your-iot-endpoint
   ```

------

The sample app:

1. Connects to the AWS IoT service for your account\.

1. Subscribes to the message topic, **topic\_1**, and displays the messages it receives on that topic\. 

1. Publishes 10 messages to the topic, **topic\_1**\. 

1. Displays output similar to the following:

```
Publish received on topic topic_1
{"message":"Hello world!","sequence":1}
Publish received on topic topic_1
{"message":"Hello world!","sequence":2}
Publish received on topic topic_1
{"message":"Hello world!","sequence":3}
Publish received on topic topic_1
{"message":"Hello world!","sequence":4}
Publish received on topic topic_1
{"message":"Hello world!","sequence":5}
Publish received on topic topic_1
{"message":"Hello world!","sequence":6}
Publish received on topic topic_1
{"message":"Hello world!","sequence":7}
Publish received on topic topic_1
{"message":"Hello world!","sequence":8}
Publish received on topic topic_1
{"message":"Hello world!","sequence":9}
Publish received on topic topic_1
{"message":"Hello world!","sequence":10}
```

If you're having trouble running the sample app, review [Troubleshooting problems with the sample app](gs-device-troubleshoot.md)\.

You can also add the `--verbosity debug` parameter to the command line so the sample app displays detailed messages about what itâ€™s doing\. That information might provide you the help you need to correct the problem\. 

## View messages from the sample app in the AWS IoT console<a name="gs-pc-view-msg"></a>

You can see the sample app's messages as they pass through the message broker by using the **MQTT client** in the **AWS IoT console**\. 

**To view the MQTT messages published by the sample app**

1. Review [View MQTT messages with the AWS IoT MQTT client](view-mqtt-messages.md)\. This helps you learn how to use the **MQTT client** in the **AWS IoT console** to view MQTT messages as they pass through the message broker

1. Open the **MQTT client** in the **AWS IoT console**\.

1. Subscribe to the topic, **topic\_1**\.

1. In your command line window, run the sample app again and watch the messages in the **MQTT client** in the **AWS IoT console**\.
