**metric**  
AWS IoT Device Defender Detect uses metrics to detect anomalous behavior\. AWS IoT Device Defender Detect compares the reported value of a metric with the expected value you provide\. These metrics can be taken from two sources: cloud\-side metrics and device\-side metrics\.  
Abnormal behavior on the AWS IoT network is detected by using cloud\-side metrics such as the number of authorization failures, or the number or size of messages a device sends or receives through AWS IoT\.   
AWS IoT Device Defender Detect can also collect, aggregate, and monitor metrics data generated by AWS IoT devices \(for example, the ports a device is listening on, the number of bytes or packets sent, or the device's TCP connections\)\.  
You can use AWS IoT Device Defender Detect with cloud\-side metrics alone\. To use device\-side metrics, you must first deploy the AWS IoT SDK on your AWS IoT connected devices or device gateways to collect the metrics and send them to AWS IoT\. See [Sending metrics from devices](DetectMetricsMessages.md)\. 

**dimension**  
You can define a dimension to adjust the scope of a behavior\. For example, you can define a topic filter dimension that applies a behavior to MQTT topics that match a pattern\. For information about defining a dimension for use in a security profile, see [CreateDimension](dd-api-iot-CreateDimension.md)\.

**security profile**  
A security profile defines anomalous behaviors for a group of devices \(a [thing group](thing-groups.md)\) or for all devices in your account, and specifies which actions to take when an anomaly is detected\. You can use the AWS IoT console or API commands to create a security profile and associate it with a group of devices\. AWS IoT Device Defender Detect starts recording security\-related data and uses the behaviors defined in the security profile to detect anomalies in the behavior of the devices\. 

**behavior**  
A behavior tells AWS IoT Device Defender Detect how to recognize when a device is doing something abnormal\. Each behavior consists of a name, a metric, an operator, and a value or a statistical threshold\. For some metrics, a time period \(`durationSeconds`\) is also required\. Any device action that doesn't match a defined behavior statement triggers an alert\. 

**alert**  
When an anomaly is detected, an alert notification can be sent through a CloudWatch metric \(see [Using AWS IoT metrics](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#how_to_use_metrics)\) or an SNS notification\. An alert notification is also displayed in the AWS IoT console along with information about the alert, and a history of alerts for the device\. An alert is also sent when a monitored device stops exhibiting anomalous behavior or when it had been causing an alert but stops reporting for an extended period\.
