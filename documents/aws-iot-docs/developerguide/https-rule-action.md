# HTTPS<a name="https-rule-action"></a>

The HTTPS \(`http`\) action sends data from an MQTT message to a web application or service\.

## Requirements<a name="https-rule-action-requirements"></a>

This rule action has the following requirements:
+ You must confirm and enable HTTPS endpoints before the rules engine can use them\. For more information, see [ Working with topic rule destinations](rule-destination.md)\.

## Parameters<a name="https-rule-action-parameters"></a>

When you create an AWS IoT rule with this action, you must specify the following information:

`url`  
The HTTPS endpoint where the message is sent using the HTTP POST method\. If you use an IP address in place of a host name, it must be an IPv4 address\. IPv6 addresses are not supported\.  
Supports substitution templates: Yes

`confirmationUrl`  
\(Optional\) If specified, AWS IoT uses the confirmation URL to create a matching topic rule destination\. You must enable the topic rule destination before using it in an HTTPS action\. For more information, see [ Working with topic rule destinations](rule-destination.md)\. If you use substitution templates, you must manually create topic rule destinations before the `http` action can be used\. `confirmationUrl` must be a prefix of `url`\.  
The relationship between `url` and `confirmationUrl` is described by the following:  
+ If `url` is hardcoded and `confirmationUrl` is not provided, we implicitly treat the `url` field as the `confirmationUrl`\. AWS IoT creates a topic rule destination for `url`\.
+ If `url` and `confirmationUrl` are hardcoded, `url` must begin with `confirmationUrl`\. AWS IoT creates a topic rule destination for `confirmationUrl`\.
+ If `url` contains a substitution template, you must specify `confirmationUrl` and `url` must begin with `confirmationUrl`\. If `confirmationUrl` contains substitution templates, you must manually create topic rule destinations before the `http` action can be used\. If `confirmationUrl` does not contain substitution templates, AWS IoT creates a topic rule destination for `confirmationUrl`\.
Supports substitution templates: Yes

`headers`  
\(Optional\) The list of headers to include in HTTP requests to the endpoint\. Each header must contain the following information:    
`key`  
The key of the header\.  
Supports substitution templates: No  
`value`  
The value of the header\.  
Supports substitution templates: Yes
The default content type is application/json when the payload is in JSON format\. Otherwise, it is application/octet\-stream\. You can overwrite it by specifying the exact content type in the header with the key content\-type \(case insensitive\)\. 

`auth`  
\(Optional\) The authentication used by the rules engine to connect to the endpoint URL specified in the `url` argument\. Currently, Signature Version 4 is the only supported authentication type\. For more information, see [HTTP Authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_HttpAuthorization.html)\.  
Supports substitution templates: No

## Examples<a name="https-rule-action-examples"></a>

The following JSON example defines an AWS IoT rule with an HTTPS action\.

```
{
    "topicRulePayload": {
        "sql": "SELECT * FROM 'some/topic'", 
        "ruleDisabled": false,
        "awsIotSqlVersion": "2016-03-23", 
        "actions": [
            { 
                "http": { 
                    "url": "https://www.example.com/subpath",
                    "confirmationUrl": "https://www.example.com", 
                    "headers": [
                        { 
                            "key": "static_header_key", 
                            "value": "static_header_value" 
                        },
                        { 
                            "key": "substitutable_header_key", 
                            "value": "${value_from_payload}" 
                        }
                    ] 
                } 
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## HTTP action retry logic<a name="https-rule-action-retry-logic"></a>

The AWS IoT rules engine retries the HTTPS action according to these rules:
+ The rules engine tries to send a message at least once\.
+ The rules engine retries at most twice\. The maximum number of tries is three\.
+ The rules engine does not attempt a retry if:
  + The previous try provided a response larger than 16384 bytes\.
  + The downstream web service or application closes the TCP connection after the try\.
  + The total time to complete a request with retires exceeded the request timeout limit\.
  + The request returns an HTTP status code other than 429, 500\-599\.

**Note**  
[Standard data transfer costs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) apply to retries\.
