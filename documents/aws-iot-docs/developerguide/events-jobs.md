# Jobs events<a name="events-jobs"></a>

The AWS IoT Jobs service publishes to reserved topics on the MQTT protocol when jobs are pending, completed, or canceled, and when a device reports success or failure when executing a job\. Devices or management and monitoring applications can keep track of the status of jobs by subscribing to these topics\. Use the [UpdateEventConfigurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_UpdateEventConfigurations.html) API to control the kinds of job events you receive\.

Because it can take some time to cancel or delete a job, two messages are sent to indicate the start and end of a request\. For example, when a cancellation request starts, a message is sent to the `$aws/events/job/jobID/cancellation_in_progress` topic\. When the cancellation request is complete, a message is sent to the `$aws/events/job/jobID/canceled` topic\. A similar process occurs for a job deletion request\. Management and monitoring applications can subscribe to these topics to keep track of the status of jobs\.

For more information about publishing and subscribing to MQTT topics, see [Device communication protocols](protocols.md)\.

Job Completed/Canceled/Deleted  
The AWS IoT Jobs service publishes a message on an MQTT topic when a job is completed, canceled, deleted, or when cancellation or deletion are in progress:  
+ `$aws/events/job/jobID/completed`
+ `$aws/events/job/jobID/canceled`
+ `$aws/events/job/jobID/deleted`
+ `$aws/events/job/jobID/cancellation_in_progress`
+ `$aws/events/job/jobID/deletion_in_progress`
The `completed` message contains the following example payload:
