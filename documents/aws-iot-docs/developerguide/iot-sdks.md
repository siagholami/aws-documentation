#### [ Java ]

**AWS IoT Device SDK for Java**

The AWS IoT Device SDK for Java makes it possible for Java developers to access the AWS IoT platform through MQTT or MQTT over the WebSocket protocol\. The SDK is built with shadow support\. You can access shadows by using HTTP methods, including GET, UPDATE, and DELETE\. The SDK also supports a simplified shadow access model, which allows developers to exchange data with shadows by just using getter and setter methods, without having to serialize or deserialize any JSON documents\.

### AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C<a name="iot-constrained-device-sdk"></a>

**Note**  
This SDK is intended for use by experienced embedded\-software developers\.

The AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C \(C\-SDK\) is a collection of C source files under the MIT open source license that can be used in embedded applications to securely connect IoT devices to AWS IoT Core\. It includes an MQTT, JSON Parser, and AWS IoT Device Shadow library\. It is distributed in source form and intended to be built into customer firmware along with application code, other libraries and, optionally, an RTOS \(Real Time Operating System\)\.

For Fleet Provisioning, use the `v4_beta_deprecated` version of the AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C at [ https://github\.com/aws/aws\-iot\-device\-sdk\-embedded\-C/tree/v4\_beta\_deprecated](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/v4_beta_deprecated)\. Please review the README in this branch for more details\.

The AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C is generally targeted at resource constrained devices that require an optimized C language runtime\. You can use the SDK on any operating system and host it on any processor type \(for example, MCUs and MPUs\)\. However, if your devices have sufficient memory and processing resources, we recommend that you use one of the higher order [AWS IoT Device SDKs](#iot-device-sdks)\.
