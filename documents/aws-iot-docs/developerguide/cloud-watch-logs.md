# Monitor AWS IoT using CloudWatch Logs<a name="cloud-watch-logs"></a>

When [AWS IoT logging is enabled](configure-logging.md), AWS IoT sends progress events about each message as it passes from your devices through the message broker and rules engine\. In the [CloudWatch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch), CloudWatch logs appear in a log group named **AWSIotLogs**\.

For more information about CloudWatch Logs, see [CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html)\. For information about supported AWS IoT CloudWatch Logs, see [CloudWatch AWS IoT log entries](cwl-format.md)\.

   Find all logs that have a status of `Success` and an event type of `GetThingShadow`\.
