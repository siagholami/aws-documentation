# Using the AWS IoT jobs APIs<a name="jobs-api"></a>

There are two categories of API used in the AWS IoT Jobs service: 
+ Those used for management and control of jobs\.
+ Those used by the devices executing those jobs\.

In general, job management and control uses an HTTPS protocol API\. Devices can use either an MQTT or an HTTPS protocol API\. \(The HTTPS API is designed for a low volume of calls typical when creating and tracking jobs\. It usually opens a connection for a single request, and then closes the connection after the response is received\. The MQTT API allows long polling\. It is designed for large amounts of traffic that can scale to millions of devices\.\)

**Note**  
Each AWS IoT Jobs HTTPS API has a corresponding command that allows you to call the API from the AWS CLI\. The commands are lowercase, with hyphens between the words that make up the name of the API\. For example, you can invoke the `CreateJob` API on the CLI by typing:  

```
aws iot create-job ...
```

## Job management and control API<a name="jobs-http-api"></a>

### Job management and control data types<a name="jobs-control-plane-data-types"></a>

The following data types are used by management and control applications to communicate with the AWS IoT Jobs service\.

#### CreateJob<a name="jobs-CreateJob"></a>

------
#### [ CreateJob command ]

Creates a job\. You can provide the job document as a link to a file in an Amazon S3 bucket \(`documentSource` parameter\) or in the body of the request \(`document` parameter\)\.

A job can be made *continuous* by setting the optional `targetSelection` parameter to `CONTINUOUS`\. \(The default is `SNAPSHOT`\.\) A continuous job can be used to onboard or upgrade devices as they are added to a group because it continues to run and is executed on newly added things, even after the things in the group at the time the job was created have completed the job\.

A job can have an optional [TimeoutConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_TimeoutConfig.html), which sets the value of the in\-progress timer\. The in\-progress timer can't be updated and applies to all executions of the job\.

The following validations are performed on arguments to the `CreateJob` API:
+ The `targets` argument must be a list of valid thing or thing group ARNs\. All things and thing groups must be in your AWS account\.
+ The `documentSource` argument must be a valid Amazon S3 URL to a job document\. Amazon S3 URLs are of the form: `https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketName/objectName`\.
+ The document stored in the URL specified by the `documentSource` argument must be a UTF\-8 encoded JSON document\.
+ The size of a job document is limited to 32 KB due to the limit on the size of an MQTT message\(128 KB\) and encryption\.
+ The `jobId` must be unique in your AWS account\.

`jobId`  
A job identifier, which must be unique for your AWS account\. We recommend using a UUID\. Alphanumeric characters, "\-", and "\_" can be used here\.

`targets`  
A list of thing or thing group ARNs that defines the targets of the job\.

`document`  
Optional\. The job document\.

`documentSource`  
Optional\. An Amazon S3 link to the job document\.

`description`  
Optional\. A short text description of the job\.

`presignedUrlConfigData`  
Optional\. Configuration information for presigned Amazon S3 URLs\.    
`roleArn`  
The ARN of the IAM role that contains permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket\. This is the bucket that contains the data that devices download with the presigned Amazon S3 URLs\. This role must also grant AWS IoT permission to assume the role\. For more information, see [Create jobs](manage-job-cli.md#create-job)\.  
`expiresInSec`  
How long \(in seconds\) presigned URLs are valid\. Valid values are 60 \- 3600\. The default value is 3600 seconds\. Presigned URLs are generated when the AWS IoT Jobs service receives an MQTT request for the job document\. 

`targetSelection`  
Optional\. Specifies whether the job continues to run \(CONTINUOUS\) or is complete after all those things specified as targets have completed the job \(SNAPSHOT\)\. If CONTINUOUS, the job might also be scheduled to run on a thing when a change is detected in a target\. For example, a job is scheduled to run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group, even after the job was completed by all things originally in the group\.

`jobExecutionRolloutConfig`  
Optional\. Allows you to create a staged rollout of a job\.    
`maximumPerMinute`  
The maximum number of things on which the job is sent for execution, per minute\. Valid values are 1 to 1000\. If not specified, the default is 1000\. The actual number of things that receive the job might be less during any particular minute interval \(due to system latency\), but is not more than the specified value\.  
`exponentialRate`  
Allows you to create an exponential rate of rollout for a job\.    
`baseRatePerMinute`  
The minimum number of things that are notified of a pending job, per minute, at the start of job rollout\. This parameter allows you to define the initial rate of rollout\.   
`incrementFactor`  
The exponential factor to increase the rate of rollout for a job\.  
`rateIncreaseCriteria`  
The criteria to initiate the increase in rate of rollout for a job\. Set values for either the `numberOfNotifiedThings` or `numberOfSucceededThings`, but not both\.    
`numberOfNotifiedThings`  
The threshold for number of notified things that initiate the increase in rate of rollout\.   
`numberOfSucceededThings`  
The threshold for number of succeeded things that initiate the increase in rate of rollout\. 

`abortConfig`  
Optional\. Details of abort criteria to abort the job\.    
`criteriaList`  
The list of abort criteria to define rules to abort the job\.    
`action`  
The type of abort action to initiate a job abort\.  
`failureType`  
The type of job execution failure to define a rule to initiate a job abort\.  
`minNumberOfExecutedThings`  
Minimum number of executed things before evaluating an abort rule\.  
`thresholdPercentage`  
The threshold as a percentage of the total number of executed things that initiate a job abort\.

`timeoutConfig`  
Optional\. Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution of the job\. The timer is started when the job execution status is set to `IN_PROGRESS`\. If the job execution status is not set to another terminal state before the time expires, it is set to `TIMED_OUT`\.     
`inProgressTimeoutInMinutes`  
Specifies the amount of time, in minutes, this device has to finish execution of this job\. A timer is started, or restarted, whenever this job's execution status is specified as `IN_PROGRESS` with this field populated\. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state before the timer expires, or before another job execution status update is sent with this field populated, the status is set to `TIMED_OUT`\.

Response:

```
{
    "jobArn": "string",
    "jobId": "string",
    "description": "string"
}
```

`jobArn`  
The ARN of the job\.

`jobId`  
The unique identifier you assigned to this job\.

`description`  
An optional short text description of the job\.

`jobId`  
A job identifier that must be unique for your AWS account\. We recommend using a UUID\. Alphanumeric characters, "\-", and "\_" can be used here\.

`description`  
Optional\. A short text description of the job\.

`presignedUrlConfigData`  
Optional\. Configuration information for presigned Amazon S3 URLs\.    
`roleArn`  
The ARN of the IAM role that contains permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket\. This is the bucket that contains the data that devices download with the presigned Amazon S3 URLs\. This role must also grant AWS IoT permission to assume the role\. For more information, see [Create jobs](manage-job-cli.md#create-job)\.  
`expiresInSec`  
How long \(in seconds\) presigned URLs are valid\. Valid values are 60 \- 3600\. The default value is 3600 seconds\. Presigned URLs are generated when the AWS IoT Jobs service receives an MQTT request for the job document\. 

`jobExecutionRolloutConfig`  
Optional\. Allows you to create a staged rollout of a job\.    
`maximumPerMinute`  
The maximum number of things on which the job is sent for execution, per minute\. Valid values are 1 to 1000\. If not specified, the default is 1000\. The actual number of things that receive the job might be less during any particular minute interval \(due to system latency\), but are not more than the specified value\.  
`exponentialRate`  
Allows you to create an exponential rate of rollout for a job\.    
`baseRatePerMinute`  
The minimum number of things that are notified of a pending job, per minute at the start of job rollout\. This parameter allows you to define the initial rate of rollout\.   
`incrementFactor`  
The exponential factor to increase the rate of rollout for a job\.  
`rateIncreaseCriteria`  
The criteria to initiate the increase in rate of rollout for a job\. Set values for either the `numberOfNotifiedThings` or `numberOfSucceededThings`, but not both\.    
`numberOfNotifiedThings`  
The threshold for number of notified things that initiate the increase in rate of rollout\.   
`numberOfSucceededThings`  
The threshold for number of succeeded things that initiate the increase in rate of rollout\. 

`abortConfig`  
Optional\. Details of abort criteria to abort the job\.    
`criteriaList`  
The list of abort criteria to define rules to abort the job\.    
`action`  
The type of abort action to initiate a job abort\.  
`failureType`  
The type of job execution failure to define a rule to initiate a job abort\.  
`minNumberOfExecutedThings`  
Minimum number of executed things before evaluating an abort rule\.  
`thresholdPercentage`  
The threshold as a percentage of the total number of executed things that initiate a job abort\.

`timeoutConfig`  
Optional\. Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution of the job\. The timer is started when the job execution status is set to `IN_PROGRESS`\. If the job execution status is not set to another terminal state before the time expires, it is set to `TIMED_OUT`\.     
`inProgressTimeoutInMinutes`  
Specifies the amount of time, in minutes, this device has to finish execution of this job\. A timer is started, or restarted, whenever this job's execution status is specified as `IN_PROGRESS` with this field populated\. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state before the timer expires, or before another job execution status update is sent with this field populated, the status is set to `TIMED_OUT`\.

The contents of the request were invalid\. For example, this code is returned when an `UpdateJobExecution` request contains invalid status details\. The message contains details about the error\.  
InvalidStateTransition  
An update attempted to change the job execution to a state that is invalid because of the job execution's current state \(for example, an attempt to change a request in state SUCCEEDED to state IN\_PROGRESS\)\. In this case, the body of the error message also contains the `executionState` field\.  
ResourceNotFound  
The `JobExecution` specified by the request topic does not exist\.

#### StartNextPendingJobExecution<a name="mqtt-startnextpendingjobexecution"></a>

------
#### [ StartNextPendingJobExecution command ]

Gets and starts the next pending job execution for a thing \(status IN\_PROGRESS or QUEUED\)\. 
+ Any job executions with status IN\_PROGRESS are returned first\.
+ Job executions are returned in the order in which they were created\.
+ If the next pending job execution is QUEUED, its state is changed to IN\_PROGRESS and the job execution's status details are set as specified\.
+ If the next pending job execution is already IN\_PROGRESS, its status details are not changed\.
+ If no job executions are pending, the response does not include the `execution` field\.
+ You can optionally create a step timer by setting a value for the `stepTimeoutInMinutes` property\. If you don't update the value of this property by running `UpdateJobExecution`, the job execution times out when the step timer expires\.
