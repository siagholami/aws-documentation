Using Lambda with the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse
The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse provides support for authoring code for AWS Lambda. Lambda is a fully managed compute service that runs your code in response to events generated by custom code or from various AWS services such as Amazon S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, Amazon SNS, and Amazon Cognito. For more information about Lambda, see the AWS Lambda Developer Guide.
