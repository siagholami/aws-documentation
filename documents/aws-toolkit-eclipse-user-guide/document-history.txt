June 16, 2014
The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse now provides support for authoring AWS Lambda functions with Java. For more information, see Using Lambda with the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse.
September 27, 2013
 The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse now uses the same system for storing and accessing AWS credentials as the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs, which includes the ability to use multiple profiles to store more than one set of credentials. For information, see the newly-updated topic: Set up AWS Credentials.
 The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Getting Started Guide has been restructured in alignment with other AWS SDK Documentation (most notably, the AWS Java SDK upon which the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse depends). Much of the restructuring should be logical and self-evident, but a description of each of the guide’s major sections is provided in What is the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse?.
  Getting Started has been updated for Eclipse 4.3 (“Kepler”).
