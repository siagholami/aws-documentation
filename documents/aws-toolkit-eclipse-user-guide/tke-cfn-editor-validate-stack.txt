Validating a AWS CloudFormation Template in Eclipse
To validate an CloudFormation template in Eclipse 
 Perform either one of the following actions:
   Right-click the template name in the Package Explorer view and click Validate on the context menu.

   Right-click the template that you are editing in the editor pane and click Validate on the context menu.

Important
Your template will be validated for JSON correctness only; it will not be validated for CloudFormation correctness. A stack template validated in this way can still fail to launch or update.
