# What is the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse?<a name="welcome"></a>

The [AWS Toolkit for Eclipse](https://aws.amazon.com/eclipse/) is an open source plug\-in for the Eclipse integrated development environment \(IDE\) that makes it easier for developers to develop, debug, and deploy Java applications that use Amazon Web Services\. It enhances the Eclipse IDE with additional features:
+ The AWS SDK for Java is included and managed by Maven when you create a new AWS project using the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse
+ AWS Explorer, an interface to Amazon Web Services that allows you to manage your AWS resources from within the Eclipse environment\.
+ AWS Lambda Java project and Serverless Application Model \(SAM\) project blueprint creation, deployment and debugging
+ AWS CodeCommit repository cloning
+ Integration with AWS CodeStar
+ AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment and debugging
+ An AWS CloudFormation template editor
+ Support for multiple AWS accounts

**Important**  
There is no charge for using the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, however you may incur AWS charges for creating or using AWS [chargeable resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#chargeable-resources), such as running Amazon EC2  
instances or using Amazon S3 storage\. You can use the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) to estimate charges for the use of various AWS  
resources\.
