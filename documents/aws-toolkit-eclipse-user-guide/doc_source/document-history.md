The following table describes the important changes since the last release of the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse User Guide\.

 **API version:** 2010\-12\-01

 **Last documentation update:** Apr 28, 2020

**Dec 01, 2016**  
Added a new section that provides detail about the new [serverless project wizard](serverless-projects.md)\.

**Dec 22, 2015**  
Removed the *Additional Resources* topic—the information from that page is now available on the first page of the guide, under the heading [Additional documentation and resources](welcome.md#additional-resources)\.

**Oct 22, 2015**  
+ The guide has been renamed from “Getting Started Guide” to “User Guide”, to better represent its function\.
+ Installation instructions have been updated to compensate for changes in the way you select components of the toolkit to install\.

**June 16, 2014**  
The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse now provides support for authoring AWS Lambda functions with Java\. For more information, see [Using Lambda with the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse](lambda.md)\.

**September 27, 2013**  
+ The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse now uses the same system for storing and accessing AWS credentials as the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs, which includes the ability to use multiple profiles to store more than one set of credentials\. For information, see the newly\-updated topic: [Set up AWS Credentials](setup-credentials.md)\.
+ The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Getting Started Guide has been restructured in alignment with other AWS SDK Documentation \(most notably, the AWS Java SDK upon which the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse depends\)\. Much of the restructuring should be logical and self\-evident, but a description of each of the guide’s major sections is provided in [What is the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse?](welcome.md)\.
+  [Getting Started](getting-started.md) has been updated for Eclipse 4\.3 \(“Kepler”\)\.
