Set up the Toolkit
This section desribes how to install or upgrade the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse.
Prerequisites
The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse has the following prerequisites:
  An Amazon Web Services account– To obtain an AWS account, go to the AWS home page and click Sign Up Now. Signing up will enable you to use all of the services offered by AWS.
  A supported operating system– The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse is supported on Windows, Linux, macOS, or Unix.
  Java 1.8 
  Eclipse IDE for Java Developers 4.2 or later– We attempt to keep the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse current with the default version available on the Eclipse download page.
Note
Eclipse provides a number of different downloads. We recommend installing the Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers, which includes the Eclipse Web Tools Platform required by Elastic Beanstalk, the Eclipse Data Tools Platform required for Amazon SimpleDB features, the Eclipse EGit, and the M2Eclipse. If you install another version of Eclipse, make sure that you have (or that you install, using the provided links) support for these features.
  (Optional) Google Android Development Tools (ADT)– if you want AWS Toolkit for Eclipse support for the AWS Mobile SDK for Android, you must install the ADT first.
Install the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse
To install the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse


Within Eclipse, click Help and then click Install New Software.


In the Work with box, type https://aws.amazon.com/eclipse and then press Enter.


Choose the components of the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse that you want to install. Click Select All to install all components at once.
Note
AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Core (in the AWS Core Management Tools section) is required; all other components are optional.
Support for the AWS Mobile SDK for Android requires that you have the Google Android Developer Tools (ADT) for Eclipse installed first. If you have not yet installed the ADT, make sure that AWS SDK for Android is unchecked, or installation will fail.
Support for the Amazon RDS or Amazon SimpleDB managers requires that the Eclipse Data Tools Platform (DTP) is installed. The DTP is installed by default with the “Java EE Developers” version of Eclipse, or can be installed separately.


Once you have made your selections, click Next (or Finish) to complete installation.


Once you have set up the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse you should configure your AWS Credentials.
Note
Depending on the options selected, and on factors such as network speed, server latency and system capabilities, it may take up to 30 minutes for the installation to complete.
Upgrade the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse
To upgrade or reinstall the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, use the same instructions for installing the toolkit.
Some versions of Eclipse, (notably Mars and Neon), may fail to fetch the latest artifacts due to a bug in old versions of the Oomph plugin. To work around this issue:


Make sure that you’re using https://aws.amazon.com/eclipse/site.xml as the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse update site.


Delete the ~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.oomph.p2/cache/ directory to remove cached content.


Install the latest version of Oomph (Eclipse Installer).
