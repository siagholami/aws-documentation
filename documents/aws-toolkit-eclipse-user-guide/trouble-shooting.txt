Trouble Shooting
AWS CodeCommit plugin - Eclipse was unable to write to the secure store.
Problem: when checking out or checking in an AWS CodeCommit repository, I got an error saying Writing to secure store failed, No password provided. 
Solution: Open up Preferences -> General -> Security -> Security Storage -> Contents -> GIT -> Delete.
