Activating the AWS-Generated Cost Allocation Tags
Master account owners can activate the AWS generated tags in the Billing and Cost Management console. When a master account owner activates the tag, it's also activated for all member accounts. This tag is visible only in the Billing and Cost Management console and reports.
To activate the AWS generated tags
You can activate the createdBy tag in the Billing and Cost Management console.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/.


In the navigation pane, choose Cost Allocation Tags.


Under AWS-Generated Cost Allocation Tags, choose the createdBy tag.


Choose Activate.


It can take up to 24 hours for tags to activate.
