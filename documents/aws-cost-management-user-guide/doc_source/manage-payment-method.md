## Make a payment<a name="manage-making-a-payment"></a>

AWS charges your default payment method automatically at the beginning of each month\. If that charge doesn't process successfully, you can use the console to update your payment method and make a payment\.

**Note**  
If you pay by ACH direct debit, AWS provides you with your invoice and initiates the charge to your payment method within 10 days of the start of the month\. It can take 3â€“5 days for your payment to succeed\. For more information, see [Managing your ACH direct debit payment methods](manage-debit.md)\.<a name="making-a-payment"></a>

   If you pay by ACH direct debit and you receive an email from AWS saying that AWS is unable to charge your bank account and will attempt to charge your account again, work with your bank to understand what went wrong\. If you receive an email saying that AWS failed the last attempt to charge your bank account, use the **Verify and pay** button on the console to pay your invoice\.
