# Saving your Cost Explorer configuration with bookmarks or favorites<a name="ce-bookmarks"></a>

You can save your date, filter, chart style, group by, and advanced settings by saving the Cost Explorer URLs as favorites or bookmarks in your browser\. When you return to the link that you saved, Cost Explorer refreshes the page using current cost data for time range you selected and displays the most recent forecast\. This feature enables you to save a configuration that you're likely to refresh and return to often\. You can also save a configuration for a specific, unchanging range of time by using the **Custom** time range and setting fixed start and end dates for your chart\. 

**Warning**  
If you want to save a number of configurations, make sure to give each bookmark or favorite a unique name so that you don't overwrite older configurations when you save a new URL\.
