# Using identity\-based policies \(IAM policies\) for Billing and Cost Management<a name="billing-permissions-ref"></a>

This topic provides examples of identity\-based policies that demonstrate how an account administrator can attach permissions policies to IAM identities \(users, groups, and roles\) and thereby grant permissions to perform operations on Billing and Cost Management resources\.

For a full discussion of AWS accounts and IAM users, see [What Is IAM?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_Introduction.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Billing actions<a name="user-permissions"></a>

This table summarizes the permissions that allow or deny IAM users access to your billing information and tools\. For examples of policies that use these permissions, see [Billing and Cost Management policy examples](billing-example-policies.md)\.
