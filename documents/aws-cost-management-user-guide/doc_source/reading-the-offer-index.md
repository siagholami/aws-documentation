## Offer index file<a name="offer-index-example"></a>

The offer index file is available as a JSON file\. You can read the file multiple ways, such as using a text program to read the JSON file or a program that parses the JSON\.

The offer index file consists of two main sections: the metadata about the offer index file itself, and either a list of the services that AWS offers \(for the offer index file\) or a list of Regions where a service is offered \(for the regional offer index file\)\. The information about an offer file includes the URL where you can download the prices and a URL for a regional offer index file for that service\.

The offer index file looks like this:

```
{
   "":"The version number for the offer index format",
   "":"The disclaimers for this offer index",
   "":"The publication date of this offer index",
   "":{
      "firstService":{
         "":"The service that this price list is for",
         "":"The URL for this offer file",
         "":"The URL for the regional offer index file",
         "":"The URL for the Savings Plan index file (if applicable)"
      },
      "secondService":{
         "": ...,
         "": ...,
         "": ...,
         "":...
      },
      ...
   },
}
```
