 After you create and apply user\-defined tags, you can activate them for cost allocation\. If you activate your tags for cost allocation, it's a good idea to devise a set of tag keys that represent how you want to organize your costs\. Your cost allocation report displays the tag keys as additional columns with the applicable values for each row, so it's easier to track your costs if you use a consistent set of tag keys\. [m
