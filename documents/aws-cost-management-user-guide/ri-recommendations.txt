Accessing Reserved Instance Recommendations
If you enable Cost Explorer, you automatically get Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, ElastiCache, Amazon ES, and Amazon Redshift Reserved Instance (RI) purchase recommendations that could help you reduce your costs. RIs provide a discounted hourly rate (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing. Cost Explorer generates your RI recommendations using the following process:
 Identifies your On-Demand Instance usage for a service during a specific time period
 Collects your usage into categories that are eligible for an RI
 Simulates every combination of RIs in each category of usage
 Identifies the best number of each type of RI to purchase to maximize your estimated savings
For example, Cost Explorer automatically aggregates your Amazon EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional RIs to apply to the c4 family usage. Cost Explorer recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible RI. Cost Explorer also shows the equal number of normalized units so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI recommendation would be for c4.large because that is the smallest size instance in the c4 instance family.
Cost Explorer recommendations are based on a single account or organization usage of the past seven, 30, or 60 days. Cost Explorer ignores usage that is already covered by an RI. Amazon EC2, ElastiCache, Amazon ES, and Amazon Redshift recommendations are for RIs scoped to Region, not Availability Zones, and your estimated savings reflects the application of those RIs to your usage. Amazon RDS recommendations are scoped to either Single-AZ or Multi-AZ RIs. Cost Explorer updates your recommendations at least once every 24 hours.
Note
Cost Explorer doesn't forecast your usage or take forecasts into account when recommending RIs. Instead, Cost Explorer assumes that your historical usage reflects your future usage when determining which RIs to recommend. 
Linked accounts can see recommendations only if they have the relevant permissions. Linked accounts need permissions to view Cost Explorer and permissions to view recommendations. For more information, see Viewing the Cost Explorer Reservation Recommendations.

RI Recommendations for Size-Flexible RIs
Cost Explorer also considers the benefits of size-flexible regional RIs when generating your RI purchase recommendations. Size-flexible regional RIs help maximize your estimated savings across eligible instance families in your recommendations. AWS uses the concept of normalized units to compare the various sizes within an instance family. Cost Explorer uses the smallest normalization factor to represent the instance type that it recommends. For more information, see Instance Size Flexibility for EC2 Reserved Instances.
For example, let’s say you own an EC2 RI for a c4.8xlarge. This RI applies to any usage of a Linux/Unix c4 instance with shared tenancy in the same region as the RI, such as the following instances:
 One c4.8xlarge instance
 Two c4.4xlarge instances
 Four c4.2xlarge instances
 Sixteen c4.large instances
It also includes combinations of EC2 usage, such as one c4.4xlarge and eight c4.large instances.
If you own an RI that is smaller than the instance that you're running, you are charged the prorated, On-Demand price for the excess. This means that you could buy an RI for a c4.4xlarge, use a c4.4xlarge instance most of the time, but occasionally scale up to a c4.8xlarge instance. Some of your c4.8xlarge usage is covered by the purchased RI, and the rest is charged at On-Demand prices. For more information, see How Reserved Instances Are Applied in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

To view your RI recommendations

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/.

The console opens to the Dashboard, where you can see your current month-to-date usage graphs.


In the navigation pane, choose Cost Explorer.


On the Cost Explorer page, choose Launch Cost Explorer.


On the navigation bar, choose the menu. Under Select a service, choose the service that you want recommendations for. The default recommendation is for RIs with a one-year term and a payment option of Partial Upfront (based on your previous 30 days of usage).


Reading the Cost Explorer RI Recommendations
The RI recommendation page shows you your estimated potential savings, your RI purchase recommendations, and the parameters that Cost Explorer used to create your recommendations. You can change the parameters to get recommendations that might match your use case more closely.
The top of the RI recommendations page show you three numbers:
 Estimated Annual Savings – Your Estimated Annual Savings is how much Cost Explorer calculates that you could save by purchasing all the recommended RIs.
 Savings vs. On-Demand – Your Savings vs. On-Demand is your estimated savings as a percentage of your current costs.
 Purchase Recommendations – Your Purchase Recommendations is how many different RI purchase options that Cost Explorer found for you.
These numbers enable you to see a rough estimate of how much you could potentially save by buying more RIs. You can recalculate these numbers for a different use case by using the parameters in the pane on the right. The pane allows you to change the following parameters:
 RI term – The length of the RI reservation that you want recommendations for.
 Offering class – Whether you want recommendations for a standard RI or a convertible RI.
 Payment option – Whether you want to pay for recommended RIs upfront.
 Based on the past – How many days of your previous instance usage that you want your recommendations to take into account.
At the bottom of the page are tabs with some of your savings estimates. The All accounts tab enables you to see the recommendations based on the combined usage across your entire organization, and the Individual accounts tab enables you to see recommendations that Cost Explorer generated on a per-linked-account basis. The table on each tab shows the different purchase recommendations and details about the recommendations. If you want to see the usage that Cost Explorer based a recommendation on, choose the View associated usage link in the recommendation details. This takes you to a report that shows the exact parameters that Cost Explorer used to generate your recommendation. The report also shows your costs and associated usage grouped by Purchase option, so that you can view the On-Demand Instance usage that your recommendation is based on.
Note
Recommendations that Cost Explorer bases on an individual linked account consider all usage by that linked account, including any RIs used by that linked account. This includes RIs shared by another linked account. The recommendations don't assume that an RI will be shared with the linked account in the future. 
You can sort your recommendations by Monthly estimated savings, Upfront RI cost, Purchase recommendation, or Instance type.
Modifying Your RI Recommendations
You can change the information that Cost Explorer uses when it creates your recommendations, and you can also change the types of recommendations that you want. This allows you to see recommendations for the RIs that work best for you, such as All UpFront RIs with a one-year term, based on your last 30 days of usage. 
Note
Instead of forecasting your future usage, Cost Explorer assumes that your future usage is the same as your previous usage. Cost Explorer also assumes that you are renewing any expiring RIs.
