Finding prices in an offer file
The Price List Service API provides prices for all AWS products for informational purposes, including On-Demand and Reserved Instance pricing.
You can use the offer files to find the prices and terms for a specific product. For example, you can find a list of Amazon EC2 instance prices.
Note
The Price List Service API is not a comprehensive source for limited period Free Tiers, such as AWS Free Tier pricing. For complete information on Free Tier prices, see AWS Free Tier.
Use the following procedures to find prices for the products you're interested in.

Download the csv file for the service.


Open the csv file with your program of choice.

Any does not represent all AWS Regions in this scenario. It is a subset of Regions defined by other line items in the csv file, with a RelatedTo column matching the SKU for the location Any entry.


To find a list of all eligible locations and products for a given Free Tier SKU, find the Free Tier SKU under the RelatedTo column.


To find the covered usage by Free Tier across all eligible locations, see the StartingRange and EndingRange for the location Any.


Example
This example assumes there are no more entries in the price file where RelatedTo equals to the SKU ABCD.
The free tier offer with SKU ABCD is valid in Regions Asia Pacific (Singapore) and US East (Ohio), but not in AWS GovCloud (US). The covered usage by Free Tier is 400,000 seconds total, used across both eligible Regions.
