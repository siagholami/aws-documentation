Copying a budget
You can copy an existing budget to a new one. This enables you to retain the filters and notification settings from your original budget while still allowing you to make changes. Billing and Cost Management automatically populates the fields on the creation page for the new budget, where you can update the budget parameters. 
To copy a budget
Budgets use the same filters as Cost Explorer. For more information about the filters, see Filtering the data that you want to view.
