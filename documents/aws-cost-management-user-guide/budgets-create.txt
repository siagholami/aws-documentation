Creating a budget
You can create budgets to track your service costs and usage, RI utilization and coverage, and your Savings Plans utilization and coverage. Single accounts and master and member accounts in an AWS Organizations organization can, by default, create budgets.

 Creating a Savings Plans budget
When you create a budget, AWS Budgets provides a Cost Explorer graph to help you see your incurred costs and usage. If you haven't used Cost Explorer, then this graph is blank and AWS Budgets enables Cost Explorer when you start to create your first budget. You can create your budget without enabling Cost Explorer. It can take up to 24 hours for this graph to appear after you or AWS Budgets enable Cost Explorer.
