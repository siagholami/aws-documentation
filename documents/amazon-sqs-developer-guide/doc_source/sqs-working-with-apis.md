# Working with Amazon SQS APIs<a name="sqs-working-with-apis"></a>

This section provides information about constructing Amazon SQS endpoints, making Query API requests using the `GET` and `POST` methods, and using batch API actions\. For detailed information about Amazon SQS [actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html)—including parameters, errors, examples, and [data types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html)—see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/)\.

To access Amazon SQS using a variety of programming languages, you can also use [AWS SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk) which contain the following automatic functionality:
+ Cryptographically signing your service requests
+ Retrying requests
+ Handling error responses

For command\-line tool information, see the Amazon SQS sections in the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sqs/index.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sqs/index.html) and the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/)\.
