# List queue pagination<a name="list-all-queues-pagination"></a>

The `listQueues` and `listDeadLetterQueues` API methods support optional pagination controls\. By default, these API methods return up to 1000 queues in the response message\. You can set the `MaxResults` parameter to return fewer results in each response\. 

Set parameter `MaxResults` in the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ListQueues.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ListQueues.html) or [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ListDeadLetterSourceQueues.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ListDeadLetterSourceQueues.html) request to specify the maximum number of results to be returned in the response\. If you do not set `MaxResults`, the response includes a maximum of 1,000 results and the `NextToken` value in the response is null\. 

If you set `MaxResults`, the response includes a value for `NextToken` if there are additional results to display\. Use `NextToken` as a parameter in your next request to `listQueues` to receive the next page of results\. If there are no additional results to display, the `NextToken` value in the response is null\.
