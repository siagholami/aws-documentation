Amazon SQS access control architecture
The following diagram describes the access control for your Amazon SQS resources.

 You, the resource owner.
 Your resources contained within the AWS service (for example, Amazon SQS queues).
 Your policies. It is a good practice to have one policy per resource. The AWS service provides an API you use to upload and manage your policies.
 Requesters and their incoming requests to the AWS service.
 The access policy language evaluation code. This is the set of code within the AWS service that evaluates incoming requests against the applicable policies and determines whether the requester is allowed access to the resource.
