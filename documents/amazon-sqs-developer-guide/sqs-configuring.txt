Understanding the Amazon SQS console
When you open the console, choose Queues from the navigation pane to display the Queues page. The Queues page provides information about all of your queues in the active region. 

The entry for each queue shows the queue type and other information about the queue. The Type column helps you distinguish standard queues from First-In-First Out (FIFO) queues at a glance.
From the Queues page, there are two ways to perform actions on a queue. You can choose the option next to the queue name and then choose the action you want to perform on the queue.

You can also choose the queue name, which open the Details page for the queue. The Details page includes the same actions as the Queues page. In addition, you can choose one of the tabs below the Details section to view additional configuration details and actions.
