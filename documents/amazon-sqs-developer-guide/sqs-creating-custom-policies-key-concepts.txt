Amazon SQS Access Policy Language key concepts
To write your own policies, you must be familiar with JSON and a number of key concepts.
Allow 
The result of a Statement that has Effect set to allow.
Action 
The activity that the Principal has permission to perform, typically a request to AWS.
Default-deny 
The result of a Statement that has no Allow or Explicit-deny settings.
Condition 
Any restriction or detail about a Permission. Typical conditions are related to date and time and IP addresses.
Effect 
The result that you want the Statement of a Policy to return at evaluation time. You specify the deny or allow value when you write the policy statement. There can be three possible results at policy evaluation time: Default-deny, Allow, and Explicit-deny.
Explicit-deny 
The result of a Statement that has Effect set to deny.
Evaluation 
The process that Amazon SQS uses to determine whether an incoming request should be denied or allowed based on a Policy.
Issuer 
The user who writes a Policy to grant permissions to a resource. The issuer, by definition is always the resource owner. AWS doesn't permit Amazon SQS users to create policies for resources they don't own.
Key 
The specific characteristic that is the basis for access restriction.
Permission 
The concept of allowing or disallowing access to a resource using a Condition and a Key.
Policy 
The document that acts as a container for one or more statements.  

Amazon SQS uses the policy to determine whether to grant access to a user for a resource.
Principal 
The user who receives Permission in the Policy.
Resource 
The object that the Principal requests access to.
Statement 
The formal description of a single permission, written in the access policy language as part of a broader Policy document.
Requester 
The user who sends a request for access to a Resource.
