Troubleshooting Amazon Simple Queue Service queues using AWS X-Ray
AWS X-Ray collects data about requests that your application serves and lets you view and filter data to identify potential issues and opportunities for optimization. For any traced request to your application, you can see detailed information about the request, the response, and the calls that your application makes to downstream AWS resources, microservices, databases and HTTP web APIs.
To send AWS X-Ray trace headers through Amazon SQS, you can do one of the following:
 Use the X-Amzn-Trace-Id tracing header.
 Use the AWSTraceHeader message system attribute.
To collect data on errors and latency, you must instrument the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/index.html?com/amazonaws/services/sqs/AmazonSQSClient.html client using the AWS X-Ray SDK.
You can use the AWS X-Ray console to view the map of connections between Amazon SQS and other services that your application uses. You can also use the console to view metrics such as average latency and failure rates. For more information, see Amazon SQS and AWS X-Ray in the AWS X-Ray Developer Guide.
