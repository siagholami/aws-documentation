Deleting an Amazon SQS queue
If you no longer use an Amazon SQS queue and don't foresee using it in the near future, we recommend deleting it. 
Tip
If you want to verify that a queue is empty before you delete it, see Confirming that a queue is empty.
You can delete a queue even when it isn't empty. To delete the messages in a queue but not the queue itself, purge the queue.
