Monitoring Amazon SQS queues using CloudWatch
Amazon SQS and Amazon CloudWatch are integrated so you can use CloudWatch to view and analyze metrics for your Amazon SQS queues. You can view and analyze your queues' metrics from the Amazon SQS console, the CloudWatch console, using the AWS CLI, or using the CloudWatch API. You can also set CloudWatch alarms for Amazon SQS metrics.
CloudWatch metrics for your Amazon SQS queues are automatically collected and pushed to CloudWatch at one-minute intervals. These metrics are gathered on all queues that meet the CloudWatch guidelines for being active. CloudWatch considers a queue to be active for up to six hours if it contains any messages or if any action accesses it.
Note
There is no charge for the Amazon SQS metrics reported in CloudWatch. They're provided as part of the Amazon SQS service.
CloudWatch metrics are supported for both standard and FIFO queues.
