Using custom policies with the Amazon SQS Access Policy Language
If you want to allow Amazon SQS access based only on an AWS account ID and basic permissions (such as for https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html or https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ReceiveMessage.html), you don't need to write your own policies. You can just use the Amazon SQS https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_AddPermission.html action.
If you want to explicitly deny or allow access based on more specific conditions (such as the time the request comes in or the IP address of the requester), you need to write your own Amazon SQS policies and upload them to the AWS system using the Amazon SQS SetQueueAttributes action.
