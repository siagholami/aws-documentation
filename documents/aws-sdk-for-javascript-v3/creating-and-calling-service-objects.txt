Creating and Calling Service Objects
The JavaScript API supports most available AWS services. Each service in the JavaScript API provides a client class with a send method that you use to to invoke every API the service supports. For more information on service classes, operations, and parameters in the JavaScript API, see the API reference.
When using the SDK in Node.js, you add the SDK package for each service you need to your application using require, which provides support for all current services. The following example creates an Amazon S3 service object in the us-west-1 Region.
// Import the Amazon S3 service client
const S3 = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3"); 
// Create an S3 client in the us-west-1 Region
const s3Client = new S3.S3Client({
    region: 'us-west-1'
  });
Specifying Service Object Parameters
When calling a method of a service object, pass parameters in JSON as required by the API. For example, in Amazon S3, to get an object for a specified bucket and key, pass the following parameters to the GetObjectCommand method. For more information about passing JSON parameters, see Working with JSON.
s3Client.send(new GetObjectCommand(
  {Bucket: 'bucketName', Key: 'keyName'}
))
You can also call the GetObject method from the S3Client directly:
s3Client.getObject(
  {Bucket: 'bucketName', Key: 'keyName'}
))
For more information about Amazon S3 parameters, see Class: AWS.S3 in the API reference.
