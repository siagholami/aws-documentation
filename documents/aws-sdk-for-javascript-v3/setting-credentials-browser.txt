Setting Credentials in a Web Browser
There are several ways to supply your credentials to the SDK from browser scripts. Some of these are more secure and others afford greater convenience while developing a script. Here are the ways you can supply your credentials in order of recommendation:


Using Amazon Cognito Identity to authenticate users and supply credentials


Using web federated identity


Hard coded in the script


Warning
We do not recommend hard coding your AWS credentials in your scripts. Hard coding credentials poses a risk of exposing your access key ID and secret access key.
