Registering Certificate Bundles in Node.js
The default trust stores for Node.js include the certificates needed to access AWS services. In some cases, it might be preferable to include only a specific set of certificates.
In this example, a specific certificate on disk is used to create an https.Agent that rejects connections unless the designated certificate is provided. The newly created https.Agent is then used by the DynamoDB client.
```
var fs = require('fs'); 
var https = require('https');
const dynamodb = require('aws-sdk/clients/dynamodb')
var certs = [
  fs.readFileSync('/path/to/cert.pem')
];
var dynamodbClient = new DynamoDB({
  httpOptions: {
    agent: new https.Agent({
      rejectUnauthorized: true,
      ca: certs
    })
  }
});
```
