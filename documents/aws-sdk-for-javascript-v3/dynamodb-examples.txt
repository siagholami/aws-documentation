Amazon DynamoDB Examples
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL cloud database that supports both document and key-value store models. You create schemaless tables for data without the need to provision or maintain dedicated database servers.

The JavaScript API for DynamoDB is exposed through the AWS.DynamoDB, AWS.DynamoDBStreams, and AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient client classes. For more information about using the DynamoDB client classes, see Class: AWS.DynamoDB, Class: AWS.DynamoDBStreams, and Class: AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient in the API reference.
