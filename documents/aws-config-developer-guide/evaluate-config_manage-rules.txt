On the Rules page, you can view the rules for the region in your account. You can also see the evaluation status for each rule.
To view your rules


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Config console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/.


In the AWS Management Console, verify that the region selector is set to a region that supports AWS Config rules. For the list of supported regions, see AWS Config Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.


Choose Rules. The Rules page shows your rules and the compliance status for each.





Choose Add rule to get started with creating a rule.


Choose a rule name to see its settings.


See the compliance status of the rule when it evaluates your resources.


Choose the Edit rule icon () to edit the rule.


Choose the refresh () icon to reload compliance results.


To update a rule


Choose the Edit rule icon () for the rule that you want to update.


Modify the settings on the Config rule page to change your rule as needed.


Choose Save.


To delete a rule


Choose the Edit rule icon () for the rule that you want to delete.


On the Configure rule page, choose Delete rule.


When prompted, choose Delete.


To add a rule
If you choose Add rule, you can see the available AWS managed rules on the Add rule page. You can also create your own custom rule.


If you want to create your own rule, choose Add custom rule and follow the procedure in Developing a Custom Rule for AWS Config.


To add a managed rule, choose a rule on the page and follow the procedure in Working with AWS Config Managed Rules.



On the Add rule page, you can do the following:


Choose Add custom rule to create your own rule.


Type in the search field to filter results by rule name, description, or label. For example, type EC2 to return rules that evaluate EC2 resource types or type periodic to return rules with periodic triggers. Type "new" to search for newly added rules. For more information about trigger types, see Specifying Triggers for AWS Config Rules.


Choose the arrow icon to see the next page of rules.


Recently added rules are marked as New.


See the labels to identify the resource type that the rule evaluates and if the rule has a periodic trigger.


View, Update, and Delete Rules (AWS CLI)
To view your rules
 Use the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/describe-config-rules.html command:
$ aws configservice describe-config-rules
AWS Config returns the details for all of your rules.
To update a rule

Use the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/put-config-rule.html command with the --generate-cli-skeleton parameter to create a local JSON file that has the parameters for your rule:

$ aws configservice put-config-rule --generate-cli-skeleton > putConfigRule.json


Open the JSON file in a text editor and remove any parameters that don't need updating, with the following exceptions:
    Include at least one of the following parameters to identify the rule: 
ConfigRuleName, ConfigRuleArn, or ConfigRuleId.
    If you are updating a custom rule, you must include the Source object and its parameters.


Fill in the values for the parameters that remain. To reference the details of your rule, use the describe-config-rules command.


For example, the following JSON code updates the resource types that are in the scope of a custom rule:
{
     "ConfigRule": {
       "ConfigRuleName": "ConfigRuleName",
       "Scope": {
         "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
           "AWS::EC2::Instance",
           "AWS::EC2::Volume",
           "AWS::EC2::VPC"
         ]
       },
       "Source": {
         "Owner": "CUSTOM_LAMBDA",
         "SourceIdentifier": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:ConfigRuleName",
         "SourceDetails": [
           {
             "EventSource": "aws.config",
             "MessageType": "ConfigurationItemChangeNotification"
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   }

Use the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/put-config-rule.html command with the --cli-input-json parameter to pass your JSON configuration to AWS Config:

$ aws configservice put-config-rule --cli-input-json file://putConfigRule.json

To verify that you successfully updated your rule, use the describe-config-rules command to view the rule's configuration:

$ aws configservice describe-config-rules --config-rule-name ConfigRuleName
   {
       "ConfigRules": [
           {
               "ConfigRuleState": "ACTIVE",
               "ConfigRuleName": "ConfigRuleName",
               "ConfigRuleArn": "arn:aws:config:us-east-2:123456789012:config-rule/config-rule-nnnnnn",
               "Source": {
                   "Owner": "CUSTOM_LAMBDA",
                   "SourceIdentifier": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:ConfigRuleName",
                   "SourceDetails": [
                       {
                           "EventSource": "aws.config",
                           "MessageType": "ConfigurationItemChangeNotification"
                       }
                   ]
               },
               "Scope": {
                   "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
                       "AWS::EC2::Instance",
                       "AWS::EC2::Volume",
                       "AWS::EC2::VPC"
                   ]
               },
               "ConfigRuleId": "config-rule-nnnnnn"
           }
       ]
   }
To delete a rule
 Use the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configservice/delete-config-rule.html command as shown in the following example:
$ aws configservice delete-config-rule --config-rule-name ConfigRuleName
