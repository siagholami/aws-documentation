Managing AWS Config
At any time, you can change the settings for your IAM role and modify or delete your delivery channel (that is, the Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket and the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic). You can start or stop the configuration recorder associated with your account, and you can customize which types of resources are recorded.
