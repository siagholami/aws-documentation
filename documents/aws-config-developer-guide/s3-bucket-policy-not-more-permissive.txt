{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "11112222333"
      },
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "44445556666"
      },
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]

The first Allow statement specifies that the AWS account ID 111122223333 can retrieve objects (s3:GetObject) on any resource (*). The second Allow statement specifies that the AWS account ID 44445556666 can perform any s3 action (s3:*) on any resource (*).
Examples of NON_COMPLIANT bucket policies with the above control policy as an input parameter for the rule are as follows. 
The following bucket policy is NON_COMPLIANT because the bucket policy allows permissions for the IAM user, Alice, in the AWS account ID 888899998888. These permissions are implicitly denied by the control policy.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::888899998888:user/Alice"
        ]
      },
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
The following bucket policy is NON_COMPLIANT because the bucket policy allows the AWS account ID 11112222333 permissions to perform s3:PutBucketPolicy that is implicitly denied by the control policy.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "11112222333"
        ]
      },
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:PutBucketPolicy",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
    }
  ]
}
Examples of COMPLIANT bucket policies are as follows.

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {

        "AWS" : [
          "arn:aws:iam::11112222333:user/Bob"
        ]
      },
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/photos/*"
    }
  ]
}
The following bucket policy is COMPLIANT because the control policy allows a principal with the AWS account ID 444455556666 to perform any S3 action.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
