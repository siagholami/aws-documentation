Conformance Packs
A conformance pack is a collection of AWS Config rules and remediation actions that can be easily deployed as a single entity in an account and a Region or across an organization in AWS Organizations.
Conformance packs are created by authoring a YAML template that contains the list of AWS Config managed or custom rules and remediation actions. You can deploy the template by using the AWS Config console or the AWS CLI. To quickly get started and to evaluate your AWS environment, use one of the sample conformance pack templates.
Note
Conformance packs are only available in the redesigned AWS Config console.
