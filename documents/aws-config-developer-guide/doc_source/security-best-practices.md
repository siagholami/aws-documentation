 AWS Config provides a number of security features to consider as you develop and implement your own security policies\. The following best practices are general guidelines and donâ€™t represent a complete security solution\. Because these best practices might not be appropriate or sufficient for your environment, treat them as helpful considerations rather than prescriptions\. 
+ Leverage tagging for AWS Config, which makes is easier to manage, search for, and filter resources\.
+ Confirm your [delivery channels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/manage-delivery-channel.html) have been properly set, and once confirmed, verify that AWS Config is [recording properly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/stop-start-recorder.html)\.
