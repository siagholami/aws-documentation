Prerequisites
Before you deploy your conformance pack, turn on AWS Config recording, create a service-linked role, and provide resource-level permissions for the Amazon S3 bucket. 
Step 1: Start AWS Config Recording


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Config console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/.


Choose Settings in the navigation pane.


To start recording, under Recording is off, choose Turn on. When prompted, choose Continue.


Step 2: Create a Service-Linked Role
Create a service-linked role using the following command.
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name config-conforms.amazonaws.com --description "my service linked role for config-conforms"
There is now a new role, AWSServiceRoleForConfigConforms, in your account.
Step 3: Provide Resource-Level Permissions
Follow these steps to provide resource-level permissions on an Amazon S3 bucket to enable AWS Config to access that S3 bucket.  


Sign in to the AWS Management Console using the account that has the S3 bucket.


Open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


Select the bucket and then choose Properties. 


Choose Permissions.


Choose Edit Bucket Policy.


Copy the appropriate bucket policy into the Bucket Policy Editor window.


Same Account Same Bucket Policy: Use the following bucket policy if your template or delivery input bucket is in the same AWS account in which the conformance pack is created.

Prerequisites for Using a Conformance Pack With Remediation
Before deploying conformance packs using sample templates with remediation, you must create appropriate resources such as automation assume role and other AWS resources based on your remediation target.
If you have an existing automation role that you are using for remediation using SSM documents, you can directly provide the ARN of that role. If you have any resources you can provide those in the template. 
AWS Config does not support AWS CloudFormation intrinsic functions for the automation execution role. You must provide the exact ARN of the role as a string. 
For more information about how to pass the exact ARN, see Conformance Pack Sample Templates. While using example templates, update your Account ID and master Account ID for organization.
Prerequisites for Using a Conformance Pack With One or More AWS Config Rules
Before deploying a conformance pack with one or more custom AWS Config rules, create appropriate resources such as AWS Lambda function and the corresponding execution role. 
If you have an existing custom AWS Config rule, you can directly provide the ARN of AWS Lambda function to create another instance of that custom rule as part of the pack. 
If you do not have an existing custom AWS Config rule, you can create a AWS Lambda function and use the ARN of the Lambda function. For more information, see AWS Config Custom Rules .
If your AWS Lambda function is present in a different AWS account, you can create AWS Config rules with appropriate cross-account AWS Lambda function authorization. For more information, see How to Centrally Manage AWS Config Rules across Multiple AWS Accounts blog post.
Prerequisites for Organization Conformance Packs
Ensure the name of the delivery S3 bucket must start with prefix awsconfigconforms.
Specify an automation execution role ARN for that remediation in the template if the input template has an autoremediation configuration. Ensure a role with the specified name exists in all the accounts (master and member) of an organization. You must create this role in all accounts before calling PutOrganizationConformancePack. You can create this role manually or using the AWS CloudFormation stack-sets to create this role in every account.
If your template uses AWS CloudFormation intrinsic function [Fn::ImportValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-importvalue.html) to import a particular variable, then that variable must be defined as an [Export Value](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/outputs-section-structure.html) in all the member accounts of that organization.
For custom AWS Config rule, see How to Centrally Manage AWS Config Rules across Multiple AWS Accounts blog to setup proper permissions.
