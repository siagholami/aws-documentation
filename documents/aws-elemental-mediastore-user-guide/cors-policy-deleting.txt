Deleting a CORS policy
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. Deleting the CORS policy from a container removes permissions for cross-origin requests.
To delete a CORS policy (console)


Open the MediaStore console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/.


On the Containers page, choose the name of the container that you want to delete the CORS policy for.


The container details page appears. 


In the Container CORS policy section, choose Delete CORS policy.


Choose Continue to confirm, and then choose Save.


To delete a CORS policy (AWS CLI)
 In the AWS CLI, use the delete-cors-policy command:
aws mediastore delete-cors-policy --container-name ExampleContainer --region us-west-2
This command has no return value.
