Viewing an object lifecycle policy
An object lifecycle policy specifies how long objects should be kept in a container. 
To view an object lifecycle policy (console)


Open the MediaStore console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/.


On the Containers page, choose the name of the container that you want to view the object lifecycle policy for.


The container details page appears, with the object lifecycle policy in the Object lifecycle policy section.
To view an object lifecycle policy (AWS CLI)
 In the AWS CLI, use the get-lifecycle-policy command:
aws mediastore get-lifecycle-policy --container-name LiveEvents
The following example shows the return value:
{
      "LifecyclePolicy": "{
          "rules": [
              {
                  "definition": {
                      "path": [ 
                          {"prefix": "Football/"}, 
                          {"prefix": "Baseball/"}
                      ],
                      "days_since_create": [
                          {"numeric": [">" , 28]}
                      ]
                  },
               "action": "EXPIRE"
              }
          ]
      }"
  }
