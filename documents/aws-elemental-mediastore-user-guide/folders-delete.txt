Deleting a folder
You can delete folders only if the folder is empty; you can’t delete folders that contain objects. 
AWS Elemental MediaStore automatically deletes a folder when you delete the last object in that folder. The service also deletes any empty folders above that folder. For example, suppose that you have a folder named premium that doesn’t contain any files but does contain one subfolder named canada. The canada subfolder contains one file named mlaw.ts. If you delete the file mlaw.ts, the service deletes both the premium and canada folders. This automatic deletion applies only to folders. The service does not delete empty containers.
