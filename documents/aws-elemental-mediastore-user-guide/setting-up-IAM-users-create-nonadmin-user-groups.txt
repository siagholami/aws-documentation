Step 1: Create user groups
You can create a user group for each AWS Elemental MediaStore policy and assign users to a group rather than attaching individual policies to each user. Using the following procedure, create two user groups: one for the AWSElementalMediaStoreFullAccess policy and one for the AWSElementalMediaStoreReadOnly policy.
Note
AWSElementalMediaStoreFullAccess and AWSElementalMediaStoreReadOnly are AWS managed policies.
To create user groups


In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Groups, and then choose Create New Group. 


On the Groups page, choose Create New Group, and then create an administrator group using the AWSElementalMediaStoreFullAccess policy.


On the Set Group Name page, enter a name for the group such as MediaStoreAdmins.


Choose Next Step.


On the Attach Policy page, for Filter, choose AWS Managed, and then enter mediastore.
