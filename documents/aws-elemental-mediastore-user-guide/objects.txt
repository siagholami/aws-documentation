Objects in AWS Elemental MediaStore
AWS Elemental MediaStore assets are called objects. You can upload an object to a container or to a folder within the container.
In MediaStore, you can upload, download, and delete objects: 
 Upload – Add an object to a container or folder. This is not the same as creating an object. You must create your objects locally before you can upload them to MediaStore.
 Download – Copy an object from MediaStore to another location. This does not remove the object from MediaStore.
 Delete – Remove an object from MediaStore completely. You can delete objects individually, or you can add an object lifecycle policy to automatically delete objects within a container after a specified duration.
MediaStore accepts all file types.
