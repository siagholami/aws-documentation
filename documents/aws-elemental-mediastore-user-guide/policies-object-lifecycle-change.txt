Editing an object lifecycle policy
You can't edit an existing object lifecycle policy. However, you can change an existing policy by uploading a replacement policy. It takes up to 20 minutes for the service to apply the updated policy to the container. 
To edit an object lifecycle policy (console)


Open the MediaStore console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/.


On the Containers page, choose the name of the container that you want to edit the object lifecycle policy for.


The container details page appears. 


In the Object lifecycle policy section, choose Edit object lifecycle policy.


Make your changes to the policy, and then choose Save.


To edit an object lifecycle policy (AWS CLI)

Create a file that defines the updated object lifecycle policy:

{        
       "rules": [
            {
               "definition": {
                   "path": [ 
                       {"prefix": "Football/"}, 
                       {"prefix": "Baseball/"}
                       {"prefix": "Basketball/"}
                   ],
                   "days_since_create": [
                       {"numeric": [">" , 28]}
                   ]
               },
               "action": "EXPIRE"
           }
       ]
   }

In the AWS CLI, use the put-lifecycle-policy command:

aws mediastore put-lifecycle-policy --container-name LiveEvents --lifecycle-policy file://LiveEvents2LifecyclePolicy
This command has no return value. The service attaches the specified policy to the container, replacing the previous policy.
