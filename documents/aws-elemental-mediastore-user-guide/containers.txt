Containers in AWS Elemental MediaStore
You use containers in MediaStore to store your folders and objects. Related objects can be grouped in containers in the same way that you use a directory to group files in a file system. You arenâ€™t charged when you create containers; you are charged only when you upload an object to a container. For more information about charges, see AWS Elemental MediaStore Pricing.
