Rules for folder names
When you choose a name for your folder, remember the following:
 The name must be unique only within its parent container or folder. For example, you can create a folder named myfolder in two different containers: movies/myfolder and sports/myfolder.
 The name can have the same name as its parent container.
 The name can contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, periods (.), hyphens (-), and tildes (\~).
 The name must start with a number or letter.
 The name must be from 3 to 63 characters long.
 The name must not be formatted as an IP address (for example, 192.168.5.4).
 The name must not contain underscores (_).
 The name must not end with a hyphen.
 The name can't contain two, adjacent periods.
 The name can't contain dashes next to periods (e.g., my-.container.com and my.-container are invalid).
 Names are case sensitive. For example, you can have a folder named myFolder and a folder named myfolder in the same container or folder because those names are unique.
 The folder canâ€™t be renamed after it has been created.
