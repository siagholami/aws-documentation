# Rules for container names<a name="containers-rules-for-names"></a>

When you choose a name for your container, remember the following:
+ The name must be unique within the current account for the current AWS Region\.
+ The name can contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores \(\_\)\.
+ The name must be from 1 to 255 characters long\.
+ Names are case sensitive\. For example, you can have a container named `myContainer` and a folder named `mycontainer` because those names are unique\.
+ A container canâ€™t be renamed after it has been created\.
