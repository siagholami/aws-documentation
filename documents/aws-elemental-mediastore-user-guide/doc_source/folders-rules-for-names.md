# Rules for folder names<a name="folders-rules-for-names"></a>

When you choose a name for your folder, remember the following:
+ The name must be unique only within its parent container or folder\. For example, you can create a folder named `myfolder` in two different containers: `movies/myfolder` and `sports/myfolder`\.
+ The name can have the same name as its parent container\.
+ The name can contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, periods \(\.\), hyphens \(\-\), and tildes \(\~\)\.
+ The name must start with a number or letter\.
+ The name must be from 3 to 63 characters long\.
+ The name must not be formatted as an IP address \(for example, 192\.168\.5\.4\)\.
+ The name must not contain underscores \(\_\)\.
+ The name must not end with a hyphen\.
+ The name can't contain two, adjacent periods\.
+ The name can't contain dashes next to periods \(e\.g\., my\-\.container\.com and my\.\-container are invalid\)\.
+ Names are case sensitive\. For example, you can have a folder named `myFolder` and a folder named `myfolder` in the same container or folder because those names are unique\.
+ The folder can’t be renamed after it has been created\.
