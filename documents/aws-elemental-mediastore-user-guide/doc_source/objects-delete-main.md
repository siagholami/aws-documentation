# Deleting objects<a name="objects-delete-main"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaStore offers different options for deleting objects from containers:
+ [Delete an individual object](objects-delete.md)\. No charges apply\.
+ [Empty a container](objects-empty-container.md) to delete all objects within a container at once\. Because this process uses API calls, normal API charges apply\.
+ [Add an object lifecycle policy](policies-object-lifecycle-add.md) to delete objects when they reach a certain age\. No charges apply\.
