# Access log format<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch-logs-format"></a>

The access log files consist of a sequence of JSON\-formatted log records, where each log record represents one request\. The order of the fields within the log can vary\. The following is an example log that consists of two log records:

```
{
  "Path": "/FootballMatch/West",
  "Requester": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/maria-garcia",
  "AWSAccountId": "111122223333",
  "RequestID": "aaaAAA111bbbBBB222cccCCC333dddDDD444eeeEEE555fffFFF666gggGGG777hhhHHH888iiiIII999jjjJJJ",
  "ContainerName": "LiveEvents",
  "TotalTime": 147,
  "BytesReceived": 1572864,
  "BytesSent": 184,
  "ReceivedTime": "2018-12-13T12:22:06.245Z",
  "Operation": "PutObject",
  "ErrorCode": null,
  "Source": "192.0.2.3",
  "HTTPStatus": 200,
  "TurnAroundTime': 7,
}
 {
  "Path": "/FootballMatch/West",
  "Requester": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/maria-garcia",
  "AWSAccountId": "111122223333",
  "RequestID": "dddDDD444eeeEEE555fffFFF666gggGGG777hhhHHH888iiiIII999jjjJJJ000cccCCC333bbbBBB222aaaAAA",
  "ContainerName": "LiveEvents",
  "TotalTime": 3,
  "BytesReceived": 641354,
  "BytesSent": 163,
  "ReceivedTime": "2018-12-13T12:22:51.779Z",
  "Operation": "PutObject",
  "ErrorCode": "ValidationException",
  "Source": "198.51.100.15",
  "HTTPStatus": 400,
  "TurnAroundTime": 1,
}
```

The following list describes the log record fields:

AWSAccountId  
The AWS account ID of the account that was used to make the request\.

BytesReceived  
The number of bytes in the request body that the MediaStore server receives\.

BytesSent  
The number of bytes in the response body that the MediaStore server sends\. This value often is the same as the value of the `Content-Length` header included with server responses\.

ContainerName  
The name of the container that received the request\.

ErrorCode  
The MediaStore error code \(such as `InternalServerError`\)\. If no error occurred, the `-` character appears\. An error code might appear even if the status code is 200 \(indicating a closed connection or an error after the server started streaming the response\)\.

HTTPStatus  
The numeric HTTP status code of the response\.

Operation  
The operation that was performed, such as `PutObject` or `ListItems`\.

Path  
The path within the container where the object is stored\. If the operation does not take a path parameter, the `-` character appears\. 

ReceivedTime  
The time of day when the request was received\. The value is `ISO86-1` date time and is based on the system clock of the host that served the request\.

Requester  
The user Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the account that was used to make the request\. For unauthenticated requests, this value is `anonymous`\. If the request fails before authentication is complete, this field might be missing from the log\. For such requests, the `ErrorCode` might identify the authorization issue\.

RequestID  
A string that is generated by AWS Elemental MediaStore to uniquely identify each request\.

Source  
The apparent internet address of the requester or the service principal of the AWS service making the call\. If intermediate proxies and firewalls obscure the address of the machine making the request, the value is set to null\.

TotalTime  
The number of milliseconds \(ms\) that the request was in flight from the server's perspective\. This value is measured beginning with the time that your request is received by the service and ending with the time that the last byte of the response is sent\. This value is measured from the server's perspective because measurements made from the client's perspective are affected by network latency\.

TurnAroundTime  
The number of milliseconds that MediaStore spent processing your request\. This value is measured from the time the last byte of your request was received until the time the first byte of the response was sent\.

The order of the fields in the log can vary\.
