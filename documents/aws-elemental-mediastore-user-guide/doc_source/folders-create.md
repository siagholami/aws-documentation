# Creating a folder<a name="folders-create"></a>

You can create folders when you upload objects\. To upload an object to a folder, you specify the path to the folder\. If the folder already exists, AWS Elemental MediaStore stores the object in the folder\. If the folder doesn’t exist, the service creates it, and then stores the object in the folder\.

For more information, see [Uploading an object](objects-upload.md)\.
