Apache Flink
Apache Flink is a streaming dataflow engine that you can use to run real-time stream processing on high-throughput data sources. Flink supports event time semantics for out-of-order events, exactly-once semantics, backpressure control, and APIs optimized for writing both streaming and batch applications.
Additionally, Flink has connectors for third-party data sources, such as the following:
 Amazon Kinesis Streams
 Apache Kafka
 Elasticsearch
 Twitter Streaming API
 Cassandra
Amazon EMR supports Flink as a YARN application so that you can manage resources along with other applications within a cluster. Flink-on-YARN allows you to submit transient Flink jobs, or you can create a long-running cluster that accepts multiple jobs and allocates resources according to the overall YARN reservation.
Flink is included in Amazon EMR release versions 5.1.0 and later.
Note
Support for the FlinkKinesisConsumer class was added in Amazon EMR release version 5.2.1.
