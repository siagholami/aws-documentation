Hue
Hue (Hadoop User Experience) is an open-source, web-based, graphical user interface for use with Amazon EMR and Apache Hadoop. Hue groups together several different Hadoop ecosystem projects into a configurable interface. Amazon EMR has also added customizations specific to Hue in Amazon EMR. Hue acts as a front-end for applications that run on your cluster, allowing you to interact with applications using an interface that may be more familiar or user-friendly. The applications in Hue, such as the Hive and Pig editors, replace the need to log in to the cluster to run scripts interactively using each application's respective shell. After a cluster launches, you might interact entirely with applications using Hue or a similar interface. For more information about Hue, see http://gethue.com.
Hue is installed by default when you launch your cluster using the Amazon EMR console. You can choose not to install Hue by using Advanced options in the Amazon EMR console when you launch a cluster, or by explicitly specifying the --applications option, and omitting Hue, when you use create-cluster from the AWS CLI.
