Using Presto with the AWS Glue Data Catalog
Using Amazon EMR release version 5.10.0 and later, you can specify the AWS Glue Data Catalog as the default Hive metastore for Presto. We recommend this configuration when you require a persistent metastore or a metastore shared by different clusters, services, applications, or AWS accounts.
AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it simple and cost-effective to categorize your data, clean it, enrich it, and move it reliably between various data stores. The AWS Glue Data Catalog provides a unified metadata repository across a variety of data sources and data formats, integrating with Amazon EMR as well as Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Redshift Spectrum, Athena, and any application compatible with the Apache Hive metastore. AWS Glue crawlers can automatically infer schema from source data in Amazon S3 and store the associated metadata in the Data Catalog. For more information about the Data Catalog, see Populating the AWS Glue Data Catalog in the AWS Glue Developer Guide.
Separate charges apply for AWS Glue. There is a monthly rate for storing and accessing the metadata in the Data Catalog, an hourly rate billed per minute for AWS Glue ETL jobs and crawler runtime, and an hourly rate billed per minute for each provisioned development endpoint. The Data Catalog allows you to store up to a million objects at no charge. If you store more than a million objects, you are charged USD$1 for each 100,000 objects over a million. An object in the Data Catalog is a table, partition, or database. For more information, see Glue Pricing.
Important
If you created tables using Amazon Athena or Amazon Redshift Spectrum before August 14, 2017, databases and tables are stored in an Athena-managed catalog, which is separate from the AWS Glue Data Catalog. To integrate Amazon EMR with these tables, you must upgrade to the AWS Glue Data Catalog. For more information, see Upgrading to the AWS Glue Data Catalog in the Amazon Athena User Guide.
Specifying AWS Glue Data Catalog as the Metastore
You can specify the AWS Glue Data Catalog as the metastore using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Amazon EMR API. When you use the CLI or API, you use the configuration classification for Presto to specify the Data Catalog. In addition, with Amazon EMR 5.16.0 and later, you can use the configuration classification to specify a Data Catalog in a different AWS account. When you use the console, you can specify the Data Catalog using Advanced Options or Quick Options.
To specify the AWS Glue Data Catalog as the default Hive metastore using the console


Open the Amazon EMR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/.


Choose Create cluster, Go to advanced options.


Under Software Configuration choose a Release of emr-5.10-0 or later and select Presto.


Select Use for Presto table metadata, choose Next, and then complete other settings for your cluster as appropriate for your application.


To specify the AWS Glue Data Catalog as the default Hive metastore using the configuration classification
For examples of how to specify the configuration classifications below when you create a cluster, see Configuring Applications.
Amazon EMR 5.16.0 and later
 Set the hive.metastore property to glue as shown in the following JSON example.
[
    {
      "Classification": "presto-connector-hive",
      "Properties": {
        "hive.metastore": "glue"
      }
    }
  ]
To specify a Data Catalog in a different AWS account, add the hive.metastore.glue.catalogid property as shown in the following JSON example. Replace acct-id with the AWS account of the Data Catalog.
[
    {
      "Classification": "presto-connector-hive",
      "Properties": {
        "hive.metastore": "glue",
        "hive.metastore.glue.catalogid": "acct-id"
      }
    }
  ]
Amazon EMR 5.10.0 through 5.15.0
Set the hive.metastore.glue.datacatalog.enabled property to true, as shown in the following JSON example:
[
    {
      "Classification": "presto-connector-hive",
      "Properties": {
        "hive.metastore.glue.datacatalog.enabled": "true"
      }
    }
  ]
Using a Data Catalog in another AWS account is not available using Amazon EMR version 5.15.0 and earlier.
To switch metastores on a long-running cluster, you can manually set these values as appropriate for your release version by connecting to the master node, editing the property values in the /etc/presto/conf/catalog/hive.properties file directly, and restarting the Presto server (sudo restart presto-server). If you use this method with Amazon EMR 5.15.0 and earlier, make sure that hive.table-statistics-enabled is set to false. This setting is not required when using release versions 5.16.0 and later; nevertheless, table and partition statistics are not supported.
IAM Permissions
The EC2 instance profile for a cluster must have IAM permissions for AWS Glue actions. In addition, if you enable encryption for AWS Glue Data Catalog objects, the role must also be allowed to encrypt, decrypt and generate the customer master key (CMK) used for encryption.
Permissions for AWS Glue Actions
The default AmazonElasticMapReduceforEC2Role managed policy attached to EMR_EC2_DefaultRole allows the required AWS Glue actions. If you use the default EC2 instance profile, no action is required. However, if you specify a custom EC2 instance profile and permissions when you create a cluster, ensure that the appropriate AWS Glue actions are allowed. Use the AmazonElasticMapReduceforEC2Role managed policy as a starting point. For a listing of AWS Glue actions, see Service Role for Cluster EC2 Instances (EC2 Instance Profile) in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
Permissions for Encrypting and Decrypting AWS Glue Data Catalog
This section is about the encryption feature of the AWS Glue Data Catalog. For more information about AWS Glue Data Catalog encryption, see Encrypting Your Data Catalog in the AWS Glue Developer Guide.
If you enable encryption for AWS Glue Data Catalog objects using AWS managed CMKs for AWS Glue, and the cluster that accesses the AWS Glue Data Catalog is within the same AWS account, you don't need to update the permissions policy attached to the EC2 instance profile. If you use a customer managed CMK, or if the cluster is in a different AWS account, you must update the permissions policy so that the EC2 instance profile has permission to encrypt and decrypt using the key. The contents of the following policy statement needs to be added regardless of whether you use the default permissions policy, AmazonElasticMapReduceforEC2Role, or you use a custom permissions policy attached to a custom EC2 instance profile. 
[
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "kms:Decrypt",
                    "kms:Encrypt",
                    "kms:GenerateDataKey"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:region:acct-id:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
            }
        ]
    }
]
Resource-Based Permissions
If you use AWS Glue in conjunction with Hive, Spark, or Presto in Amazon EMR, AWS Glue supports resource-based policies to control access to Data Catalog resources. These resources include databases, tables, connections, and user-defined functions. For more information, see AWS Glue Resource Policies in the AWS Glue Developer Guide.
When using resource-based policies to limit access to AWS Glue from within Amazon EMR, the principal that you specify in the permissions policy must be the role ARN associated with the EC2 instance profile that is specified when a cluster is created. For example, for a resource-based policy attached to a catalog, you can specify the role ARN for the default service role for cluster EC2 instances, EMR_EC2_DefaultRole as the Principal, using the format shown in the following example:
arn:aws:iam::acct-id:role/EMR_EC2_DefaultRole
The acct-id can be different from the AWS Glue account ID. This enables access from EMR clusters in different accounts. You can specify multiple principals, each from a different account.
Considerations When Using AWS Glue Data Catalog
Consider the following items when using AWS Glue Data Catalog as a metastore with Presto:
 Renaming tables from within AWS Glue is not supported.
 When you create a Hive table without specifying a LOCATION, the table data is stored in the location specified by the hive.metastore.warehouse.dir property. By default, this is a location in HDFS. If another cluster needs to access the table, it fails unless it has adequate permissions to the cluster that created the table. Furthermore, because HDFS storage is transient, if the cluster terminates, the table data is lost, and the table must be recreated. We recommend that you specify a LOCATION in Amazon S3 when you create a Hive table using AWS Glue. Alternatively, you can use the hive-site configuration classification to specify a location in Amazon S3 for hive.metastore.warehouse.dir, which applies to all Hive tables. If a table is created in an HDFS location and the cluster that created it is still running, you can update the table location to Amazon S3 from within AWS Glue. For more information, see Working with Tables on the AWS Glue Console in the AWS Glue Developer Guide. 
 Partition values containing quotes and apostrophes are not supported, for example, PARTITION (owner="Doe's").
 Column statistics are not supported.
 Using Hive authorization is not supported. As an alternative, consider using AWS Glue Resource-Based Policies. For more information, see Use Resource-Based Policies for Amazon EMR Access to AWS Glue Data Catalog.
