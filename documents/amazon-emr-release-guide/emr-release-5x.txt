5.27.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

5.26.0 Application Versions
The following applications are supported in this release: Flink, Ganglia, Hadoop, HBase, HCatalog, Hive, Hue, JupyterHub, Livy, Mahout, MXNet, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Presto, Spark, Sqoop, TensorFlow, Tez, Zeppelin, and ZooKeeper.
The diagram below depicts the application versions available in this release of Amazon EMR and the application versions in the preceding four Amazon EMR releases.
For a comprehensive history of application versions for each release of Amazon EMR, see the following diagrams:
 Application Versions for 5.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)
 Application Versions for 4.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)

5.26.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for Amazon EMR release version 5.26.0. Changes are relative to 5.25.0.
Initial release date: Aug 8, 2019
Last updated date: Aug 19, 2019
Upgrades
 AWS SDK for Java 1.11.595
 HBase 1.4.10
 Phoenix 4.14.2
 Connectors and drivers:
   DynamoDB Connector 4.11.0
   MariaDB Connector 2.4.2
   Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver 1.2.32.1056
New Features
 (Beta) With Amazon EMR 5.26.0, you can launch a cluster that integrates with Lake Formation. This integration provides fine-grained, column-level access to databases and tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. It also enables federated single sign-on to EMR Notebooks or Apache Zeppelin from an enterprise identity system. For more information, see Integrating Amazon EMR with AWS Lake Formation (Beta).
 (Aug 19, 2019) Amazon EMR block public access is now available with all Amazon EMR releases that support security groups. Block public access is an account-wide setting applied to each AWS Region. Block public access prevents a cluster from launching when any security group associated with the cluster has a rule that allows inbound traffic from IPv4 0.0.0.0/0 or IPv6 ::/0 (public access) on a port, unless a port is specified as an exception. Port 22 is an exception by default. For more information, see Using Amazon EMR Block Public Access in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 EMR Notebooks
   With EMR 5.26.0 and later, EMR Notebooks supports notebook-scoped Python libraries in addition to the default Python libraries. You can install notebook-scoped libraries from within the notebook editor without having to re-create a cluster or re-attach a notebook to a cluster. Notebook-scoped libraries are created in a Python virtual environment, so they apply only to the current notebook session. This allows you to isolate notebook dependencies. For more information, see Using Notebook Scoped Libraries in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
 EMRFS
   You can enable an ETag verification feature (Beta) by setting fs.s3.consistent.metadata.etag.verification.enabled to true. With this feature, EMRFS uses Amazon S3 ETags to verify that objects being read are the latest available version. This feature is helpful for read-after-update use cases in which files on Amazon S3 are overwritten while retaining the same name. This ETag verification capability currently does not work with S3 Select. For more information, see Configure Consistent View.
 Spark
   The following optimizations are now enabled by default: dynamic partition pruning, DISTINCT before INTERSECT, improvements in SQL plan statistics inference for JOIN followed by DISTINCT queries, flattening scalar subqueries, optimized join reorder, and bloom filter join. For more information, see Optimizing Spark Performance.
   Improved whole stage code generation for Sort Merge Join.
   Improved query fragment and subquery reuse.
   Improvements to pre-allocate executors on Spark start up.
   Bloom filter joins are no longer applied when the smaller side of the join includes a broadcast hint.
 Tez
   Resolved an issue with Tez. Tez UI now works on an EMR cluster with multiple master nodes.
Known Issues
 The improved whole stage code generation capabilities for Sort Merge Join can increase memory pressure when enabled. This optimization improves performance, but may result in job retries or failures if the spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverheadFactor is not tuned to provide enough memory. To disable this feature, set spark.sql.sortMergeJoinExec.extendedCodegen.enabled to false.
5.26.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

5.25.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for Amazon EMR release version 5.25.0. Changes are relative to 5.24.1.
Initial release date: July 17, 2019
Last updated date: Oct 30, 2019
Amazon EMR 5.25.0
Upgrades
 AWS SDK for Java 1.11.566
 Hive 2.3.5
 Presto 0.220
 Spark 2.4.3
 TensorFlow 1.13.1
 Tez 0.9.2
 Zookeeper 3.4.14
New Features
 (Oct 30, 2019) Beginning with Amazon EMR version 5.25.0, you can connect to Spark history server UI from the cluster Summary page or the Application history tab in the console. Instead of setting up a web proxy through an SSH connection, you can quickly access the Spark history server UI to view application metrics and access relevant log files for active and terminated clusters. For more information, see Access Spark History Server UI from the Console in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 Spark
   Improved the performance of some joins by using Bloom filters to pre-filter inputs. The optimization is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the Spark configuration parameter spark.sql.bloomFilterJoin.enabled to true.
   Improved the performance of grouping by string type columns.
   Improved the default Spark executor memory and cores configuration of R4 instance types for clusters without HBase installed.
   Resolved a previous issue with the dynamic partition pruning feature where the pruned table has to be on the left side of the join.
   Improved DISTINCT before INTERSECT optimization to apply to additional cases involving aliases.
   Improved SQL plan statistics inference for JOIN followed by DISTINCT queries. This improvement is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the Spark configuration parameter spark.sql.statsImprovements.enabled to true. This optimization is required by the Distinct before Intersect feature and will be enabled automatically when spark.sql.optimizer.distinctBeforeIntersect.enabled is set to true.
   Optimized join order based on table size and filters. This optimization is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the Spark configuration parameter spark.sql.optimizer.sizeBasedJoinReorder.enabled to true.
For more information, see Optimizing Spark Performance.
 EMRFS
   The EMRFS setting, fs.s3.buckets.create.enabled, is now disabled by default. With testing, we found that disabling this setting improves performance and prevents unintentional creation of S3 buckets. If your application relies on this functionality, you can enable it by setting the property fs.s3.buckets.create.enabled to true in the emrfs-site configuration classification. For information, see Supplying a Configuration when Creating a Cluster.
 Local Disk Encryption and S3 Encryption Improvements in Security Configurations (August 5, 2019)
   Separated Amazon S3 encryption settings from local disk encryption settings in security configuration setup.
   Added an option to enable EBS encryption with release 5.24.0 and later. Selecting this option encrypts the root device volume in addition to storage volumes. Previous versions required using a custom AMI to encrypt the root device volume.
   For more information, see Encryption Options in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
5.25.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

   Improved performance of INTERSECT queries. This optimization is disabled by default. To enable it, set the Spark configuration parameter spark.sql.optimizer.distinctBeforeIntersect.enabled to true.
   Added optimization to flatten scalar subqueries with aggregates that use the same relation. The optimization is disabled by default. To enable it, set the Spark configuration parameter spark.sql.optimizer.flattenScalarSubqueriesWithAggregates.enabled to true.
   Improved whole stage code generation.
For more information, see Optimizing Spark Performance.
 Local Disk Encryption and S3 Encryption Improvements in Security Configurations (August 5, 2019)
   Separated Amazon S3 encryption settings from local disk encryption settings in security configuration setup.
   Added an option to enable EBS encryption. Selecting this option encrypts the root device volume in addition to storage volumes. Previous versions required using a custom AMI to encrypt the root device volume.

5.23.0 Application Versions
The following applications are supported in this release: Flink, Ganglia, Hadoop, HBase, HCatalog, Hive, Hue, JupyterHub, Livy, Mahout, MXNet, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Presto, Spark, Sqoop, TensorFlow, Tez, Zeppelin, and ZooKeeper.
The diagram below depicts the application versions available in this release of Amazon EMR and the application versions in the preceding four Amazon EMR releases.
For a comprehensive history of application versions for each release of Amazon EMR, see the following diagrams:
 Application Versions for 5.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)
 Application Versions for 4.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)

5.23.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for Amazon EMR release version 5.23.0. Changes are relative to 5.22.0.
Initial release date: April 01, 2019
Last updated date: April 30, 2019
Upgrades
 AWS SDK for Java 1.11.519
New Features
 (April 30, 2019) With Amazon EMR 5.23.0 and later, you can launch a cluster with three master nodes to support high availability of applications like YARN Resource Manager, HDFS Name Node, Spark, Hive, and Ganglia. The master node is no longer a potential single point of failure with this feature. If one of the master nodes fails, Amazon EMR automatically fails over to a standby master node and replaces the failed master node with a new one with the same configuration and bootstrap actions. For more information, see Plan and Configure Master Nodes.
Known Issues
 Tez UI (Fixed in Amazon EMR release version 5.26.0)
Tez UI does not work on an EMR cluster with multiple master nodes. 
 Hue (Fixed in Amazon EMR release version 5.24.0)
   Hue running on Amazon EMR does not support Solr. Beginning with Amazon EMR release version 5.20.0, a misconfiguration issue causes Solr to be enabled and a harmless error message to appear similar to the following:
`Solr server could not be contacted properly: HTTPConnectionPool('host=ip-xx-xx-xx-xx.ec2.internal', port=1978): Max retries exceeded with url: /solr/admin/info/system?user.name=hue&doAs=administrator&wt=json (Caused by NewConnectionError(': Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused',))`

**To prevent the Solr error message from appearing:**

1. Connect to the master node command line using SSH\.

1. Use a text editor to open the `hue.ini` file\. For example:

   `sudo vim /etc/hue/conf/hue.ini`

1. Search for the term "appblacklist" and modify the line to the following:

   ```
   appblacklist = search
   ```

1. Save your changes and restart Hue as shown in the following example:

   ```
   sudo stop hue; sudo start hue
   ```

5.23.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

5.22.0 Application Versions
The following applications are supported in this release: Flink, Ganglia, Hadoop, HBase, HCatalog, Hive, Hue, JupyterHub, Livy, Mahout, MXNet, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Presto, Spark, Sqoop, TensorFlow, Tez, Zeppelin, and ZooKeeper.
The diagram below depicts the application versions available in this release of Amazon EMR and the application versions in the preceding four Amazon EMR releases.
For a comprehensive history of application versions for each release of Amazon EMR, see the following diagrams:
 Application Versions for 5.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)
 Application Versions for 4.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)

5.22.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for Amazon EMR release version 5.22.0. Changes are relative to 5.21.0.
Important
Beginning with Amazon EMR release version 5.22.0, Amazon EMR uses AWS Signature Version 4 exclusively to authenticate requests to Amazon S3. Earlier Amazon EMR release versions use AWS Signature Version 2 in some cases, unless the release notes indicate that Signature Version 4 is used exclusively. For more information, see Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4) and Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 2) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
Initial release date: March 20, 2019
Upgrades
 Flink 1.7.1
 HBase 1.4.9
 Oozie 5.1.0
 Phoenix 4.14.1
 Zeppelin 0.8.1
 Connectors and drivers:
   DynamoDB Connector 4.8.0
   MariaDB Connector 2.2.6
   Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver 1.2.20.1043
New Features
 Modified the default EBS configuration for EC2 instance types with EBS-only storage. When you create a cluster using Amazon EMR release version 5.22.0 and later, the default amount of EBS storage increases based on the size of the instance. In addition, we split increased storage across multiple volumes, giving increased IOPS performance. If you want to use a different EBS instance storage configuration, you can specify it when you create an EMR cluster or add nodes to an existing cluster. For more information about the amount of storage and number of volumes allocated by default for each instance type, see Default EBS Storage for Instances in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 Spark
   Introduced a new configuration property for Spark on YARN, spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverheadFactor. The value of this property is a scale factor that sets the value of memory overhead to a percentage of executor memory, with a minimum of 384 MB. If memory overhead is set explicitly using spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead, this property has no effect. The default value is 0.1875, representing 18.75%. This default for Amazon EMR leaves more space in YARN containers for executor memory overhead than the 10% default set internally by Spark. The Amazon EMR default of 18.75% empirically showed fewer memory-related failures in TPC-DS benchmarks.
   Backported SPARK-26316 to improve performance.
 In Amazon EMR version 5.19.0, 5.20.0, and 5.21.0, YARN node labels are stored in an HDFS directory. In some situations, this leads to core node startup delays and then causes cluster time-out and launch failure. Beginning with Amazon EMR 5.22.0, this issue is resolved. YARN node labels are stored on the local disk of each cluster node, avoiding dependencies on HDFS. 
Known Issues
 Hue (Fixed in Amazon EMR release version 5.24.0)
   Hue running on Amazon EMR does not support Solr. Beginning with Amazon EMR release version 5.20.0, a misconfiguration issue causes Solr to be enabled and a harmless error message to appear similar to the following:
`Solr server could not be contacted properly: HTTPConnectionPool('host=ip-xx-xx-xx-xx.ec2.internal', port=1978): Max retries exceeded with url: /solr/admin/info/system?user.name=hue&doAs=administrator&wt=json (Caused by NewConnectionError(': Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused',))`

**To prevent the Solr error message from appearing:**

1. Connect to the master node command line using SSH\.

1. Use a text editor to open the `hue.ini` file\. For example:

   `sudo vim /etc/hue/conf/hue.ini`

1. Search for the term "appblacklist" and modify the line to the following:

   ```
   appblacklist = search
   ```

1. Save your changes and restart Hue as shown in the following example:

   ```
   sudo stop hue; sudo start hue
   ```

5.22.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

Release 5.21.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for Amazon EMR release version 5.21.0. Changes are relative to 5.20.0.
Initial release date: February 18, 2019
Last updated date: April 3, 2019
Upgrades
 Flink 1.7.0
 Presto 0.215
 AWS SDK for Java 1.11.479
New Features
 (April 3, 2019) With Amazon EMR version 5.21.0 and later, you can override cluster configurations and specify additional configuration classifications for each instance group in a running cluster. You do this by using the Amazon EMR console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the AWS SDK. For more information, see Supplying a Configuration for an Instance Group in a Running Cluster.
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 Zeppelin
   Backported ZEPPELIN-3878.
Known Issues
 Hue (Fixed in Amazon EMR release version 5.24.0)
   Hue running on Amazon EMR does not support Solr. Beginning with Amazon EMR release version 5.20.0, a misconfiguration issue causes Solr to be enabled and a harmless error message to appear similar to the following:
`Solr server could not be contacted properly: HTTPConnectionPool('host=ip-xx-xx-xx-xx.ec2.internal', port=1978): Max retries exceeded with url: /solr/admin/info/system?user.name=hue&doAs=administrator&wt=json (Caused by NewConnectionError(': Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused',))`

**To prevent the Solr error message from appearing:**

1. Connect to the master node command line using SSH\.

1. Use a text editor to open the `hue.ini` file\. For example:

   `sudo vim /etc/hue/conf/hue.ini`

1. Search for the term "appblacklist" and modify the line to the following:

   ```
   appblacklist = search
   ```

1. Save your changes and restart Hue as shown in the following example:

   ```
   sudo stop hue; sudo start hue
   ```


Tez

This issue was fixed in Amazon EMR 5.22.0.
When you connect to the Tez UI at http://MasterDNS:8080/tez-ui through an SSH connection to the cluster master node, the error "Adapter operation failed - Timeline server (ATS) is out of reach. Either it is down, or CORS is not enabled" appears, or tasks unexpectedly show N/A.
This is caused by the Tez UI making requests to the YARN Timeline Server using localhost rather than the host name of the master node. As a workaround, a script is available to run as a bootstrap action or step. The script updates the host name in the Tez configs.env file. For more information and the location of the script, see the Bootstrap Instructions.
 In Amazon EMR version 5.19.0, 5.20.0, and 5.21.0, YARN node labels are stored in an HDFS directory. In some situations, this leads to core node startup delays and then causes cluster time-out and launch failure. Beginning with Amazon EMR 5.22.0, this issue is resolved. YARN node labels are stored on the local disk of each cluster node, avoiding dependencies on HDFS.

5.20.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for Amazon EMR release version 5.20.0. Changes are relative to 5.19.0.
Initial release date: December 18, 2018
Last updated date: January 22, 2019
Upgrades
 Flink 1.6.2
 HBase 1.4.8
 Hive 2.3.4
 Hue 4.3.0
 MXNet 1.3.1
 Presto 0.214
 Spark 2.4.0
 TensorFlow 1.12.0
 Tez 0.9.1
 AWS SDK for Java 1.11.461
New Features
 (January 22, 2019) Kerberos in Amazon EMR has been improved to support authenticating principals from an external KDC. This centralizes principal management because multiple clusters can share a single, external KDC. In addition, the external KDC can have a cross-realm trust with an Active Directory domain. This allows all clusters to authenticate principals from Active Directory. For more information, see Use Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 Default Amazon Linux AMI for Amazon EMR
   Python3 package was upgraded from python 3.4 to 3.6.
 The EMRFS S3-optimized committer 
   The EMRFS S3-optimized committer is now enabled by default, which improves write performance. For more information, see Using the EMRFS S3-optimized Committer.
 Hive
   Backported HIVE-16686.
 Glue with Spark and Hive
   In EMR 5.20.0 or later, parallel partition pruning is enabled automatically for Spark and Hive when AWS Glue Data Catalog is used as the metastore. This change significantly reduces query planning time by executing multiple requests in parallel to retrieve partitions. The total number of segments that can be executed concurrently range between 1 and 10. The default value is 5, which is a recommended setting. You can change it by specifying the property aws.glue.partition.num.segments in hive-site configuration classification. If throttling occurs, you can turn off the feature by changing the value to 1. For more information, see AWS Glue Segment Structure.
Known Issues
 Hue (Fixed in Amazon EMR release version 5.24.0)
   Hue running on Amazon EMR does not support Solr. Beginning with Amazon EMR release version 5.20.0, a misconfiguration issue causes Solr to be enabled and a harmless error message to appear similar to the following:
`Solr server could not be contacted properly: HTTPConnectionPool('host=ip-xx-xx-xx-xx.ec2.internal', port=1978): Max retries exceeded with url: /solr/admin/info/system?user.name=hue&doAs=administrator&wt=json (Caused by NewConnectionError(': Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused',))`

**To prevent the Solr error message from appearing:**

1. Connect to the master node command line using SSH\.

1. Use a text editor to open the `hue.ini` file\. For example:

   `sudo vim /etc/hue/conf/hue.ini`

1. Search for the term "appblacklist" and modify the line to the following:

   ```
   appblacklist = search
   ```

1. Save your changes and restart Hue as shown in the following example:

   ```
   sudo stop hue; sudo start hue
   ```


Tez

This issue was fixed in Amazon EMR 5.22.0.
When you connect to the Tez UI at http://MasterDNS:8080/tez-ui through an SSH connection to the cluster master node, the error "Adapter operation failed - Timeline server (ATS) is out of reach. Either it is down, or CORS is not enabled" appears, or tasks unexpectedly show N/A.
This is caused by the Tez UI making requests to the YARN Timeline Server using localhost rather than the host name of the master node. As a workaround, a script is available to run as a bootstrap action or step. The script updates the host name in the Tez configs.env file. For more information and the location of the script, see the Bootstrap Instructions.
 In Amazon EMR version 5.19.0, 5.20.0, and 5.21.0, YARN node labels are stored in an HDFS directory. In some situations, this leads to core node startup delays and then causes cluster time-out and launch failure. Beginning with Amazon EMR 5.22.0, this issue is resolved. YARN node labels are stored on the local disk of each cluster node, avoiding dependencies on HDFS. 


5.20.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

New Features
 (Nov. 19, 2018) EMR Notebooks is a managed environment based on Jupyter Notebook. It supports Spark magic kernels for PySpark, Spark SQL, Spark R, and Scala. EMR Notebooks can be used with clusters created using Amazon EMR release version 5.18.0 and later. For more information, see Using EMR Notebooks in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
 The EMRFS S3-optimized committer is available when writing Parquet files using Spark and EMRFS. This committer improves write performance. For more information, see Using the EMRFS S3-optimized Committer.
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 YARN
   Modified the logic that limits the application master process to running on core nodes. This functionality now uses the YARN node labels feature and properties in the yarn-site and capacity-scheduler configuration classifications. For information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-instances-guidelines.html#emr-plan-spot-YARN.
 Default Amazon Linux AMI for Amazon EMR
   ruby18, php56, and gcc48 are no longer installed by default. These can be installed if desired using yum.
   The aws-java-sdk ruby gem is no longer installed by default. It can be installed using gem install aws-java-sdk, if desired. Specific components can also be installed. For example, gem install aws-java-sdk-s3.
Known Issues
 EMR Notebooks—In some circumstances, with multiple notebook editors open, the notebook editor may appear unable to connect to the cluster. If this happens, clear browser cookies and then reopen notebook editors.
 CloudWatch ContainerPending Metric and Automatic Scaling—(Fixed in 5.20.0)Amazon EMR may emit a negative value for ContainerPending. If ContainerPending is used in an automatic scaling rule, automatic scaling does not behave as expected. Avoid using ContainerPending with automatic scaling.
 In Amazon EMR version 5.19.0, 5.20.0, and 5.21.0, YARN node labels are stored in an HDFS directory. In some situations, this leads to core node startup delays and then causes cluster time-out and launch failure. Beginning with Amazon EMR 5.22.0, this issue is resolved. YARN node labels are stored on the local disk of each cluster node, avoiding dependencies on HDFS. 
5.19.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

 Component Versions
 Configuration Classifications
Release 5.17.0 Application Versions
The following applications are supported in this release: Flink, Ganglia, Hadoop, HBase, HCatalog, Hive, Hue, JupyterHub, Livy, Mahout, MXNet, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Presto, Spark, Sqoop, TensorFlow, Tez, Zeppelin, and ZooKeeper.
The diagram below depicts the application versions available in this release of Amazon EMR and the application versions in the preceding four Amazon EMR releases.
For a comprehensive history of application versions for each release of Amazon EMR, see the following diagrams:
 Application Versions for 5.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)
 Application Versions for 4.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)

Release 5.17.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for Amazon EMR release version 5.17.0. Changes are relative to 5.16.0.
Initial release date: August 30, 2018
Upgrades
 Flink 1.5.2
 HBase 1.4.6
 Presto 0.206
New Features
 Added support for Tensorflow. For more information, see TensorFlow.
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 JupyterHub
   Added support for notebook persistence in Amazon S3. For more information, see Configuring Persistence for Notebooks in Amazon S3.
 Spark
   Added support for S3 Select. For more information, see Using S3 Select with Spark to Improve Query Performance.
 Resolved the issues with the Cloudwatch metrics and the automatic scaling feature in Amazon EMR version 5.14.0, 5.15.0, or 5.16.0. 
Known Issues
 When you create a kerberized cluster with Livy installed, Livy fails with an error that simple authentication is not enabled. Rebooting the Livy server resolves the issue. As a workaround, add a step during cluster creation that runs sudo restart livy-server on the master node.
 If you use a custom Amazon Linux AMI based on an Amazon Linux AMI with a creation date of 2018-08-11, the Oozie server fails to start. If you use Oozie, create a custom AMI based on an Amazon Linux AMI ID with a different creation date. You can use the following AWS CLI command to return a list of Image IDs for all HVM Amazon Linux AMIs with a 2018.03 version, along with the release date, so that you can choose an appropriate Amazon Linux AMI as your base. Replace MyRegion with your region identifier, such as us-west-2.
aws ec2 --region MyRegion describe-images --owner amazon --query 'Images[?Name!=`null`]|[?starts_with(Name, `amzn-ami-hvm-2018.03`) == `true`].[CreationDate,ImageId,Name]' --output text | sort -rk1

Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 HBase
   Backported HBASE-20723
 Presto
   Configuration changes to support LDAP authentication. For more information, see Using LDAP Authentication for Presto on Amazon EMR.
 Spark
   Apache Spark version 2.3.1, available beginning with Amazon EMR release version 5.16.0, addresses CVE-2018-8024 and CVE-2018-1334. We recommend that you migrate earlier versions of Spark to Spark version 2.3.1 or later.
Known Issues
 This release version does not support the c1.medium or m1.small instance types. Clusters using either of these instance types fail to start. As a workaround, specify a different instance type or use a different release version.
 When you create a kerberized cluster with Livy installed, Livy fails with an error that simple authentication is not enabled. Rebooting the Livy server resolves the issue. As a workaround, add a step during cluster creation that runs sudo restart livy-server on the master node.
 After the master node reboots or the instance controller restarts, the CloudWatch metrics will not be collected and the automatic scaling feature will not be available in Amazon EMR version 5.14.0, 5.15.0, or 5.16.0. This issue is fixed in Amazon EMR version 5.17.0. 
5.16.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

Release 5.14.1 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

Release 5.14.0 Application Versions
The following applications are supported in this release: Flink, Ganglia, Hadoop, HBase, HCatalog, Hive, Hue, JupyterHub, Livy, Mahout, MXNet, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Presto, Spark, Sqoop, Tez, Zeppelin, and ZooKeeper.
The diagram below depicts the application versions available in this release of Amazon EMR and the application versions in the preceding four Amazon EMR releases.

Release 5.14.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for Amazon EMR release version 5.14.0. Changes are relative to 5.13.0.
Initial release date: June 4, 2018
Upgrades
 Upgraded Apache Flink to 1.4.2
 Upgraded Apache MXnet to 1.1.0
 Upgraded Apache Sqoop to 1.4.7
New Features
 Added JupyterHub support. For more information, see JupyterHub.
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 EMRFS
   The userAgent string in requests to Amazon S3 has been updated to contain the user and group information of the invoking principal. This can be used with AWS CloudTrail logs for more comprehensive request tracking.
 HBase
    Included HBASE-20447, which addresses an issue that could cause cache issues, especially with split regions. 
 MXnet
   Added OpenCV libraries.
 Spark
   When Spark writes Parquet files to an Amazon S3 location using EMRFS, the FileOutputCommitter algorithm has been updated to use version 2 instead of version 1. This reduces the number of renames, which improves application performance. This change does not affect: 
     Applications other than Spark. 
     Applications that write to other file systems, such as HDFS (which still use version 1 of FileOutputCommitter).
     Applications that use other output formats, such as text or csv, that already use EMRFS direct write.
Known Issues
 JupyterHub
   Using configuration classifications to set up JupyterHub and individual Jupyter notebooks when you create a cluster is not supported. Edit the jupyterhub_config.py file and jupyter_notebook_config.py files for each user manually. For more information, see Configuring JupyterHub.
   JupyterHub fails to start on clusters within a private subnet, failing with the message Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/etc/jupyter/conf/server.crt'. This is caused by an error in the script that generates self-signed certificates. Use the following workaround to generate self-signed certificates. All commands are executed while connected to the master node.
1. Copy the certificate generation script from the container to the master node:

   ```
   sudo docker cp jupyterhub:/tmp/gen_self_signed_cert.sh ./
   ```

1. Use a text editor to change line 23 to change public hostname to local hostname as shown below:

   ```
   local hostname=$(curl -s $EC2_METADATA_SERVICE_URI/local-hostname)
   ```

1. Run the script to generate self\-signed certificates:

   ```
   sudo bash ./gen_self_signed_cert.sh
   ```

1. Move the certificate files that the script generates to the `/etc/jupyter/conf/` directory:

   ```
   sudo mv /tmp/server.crt /tmp/server.key /etc/jupyter/conf/
   ```

You can `tail` the `jupyter.log` file to verify that JupyterHub restarted and is returning a 200 response code\. For example:

```
tail -f /var/log/jupyter/jupyter.log
```

This should return a response similar to the following:

```
# [I 2018-06-14 18:56:51.356 JupyterHub app:1581] JupyterHub is now running at https://:9443/
# 19:01:51.359 - info: [ConfigProxy] 200 GET /api/routes
```


After the master node reboots or the instance controller restarts, the CloudWatch metrics will not be collected and the automatic scaling feature will not be available in Amazon EMR version 5.14.0, 5.15.0, or 5.16.0. This issue is fixed in Amazon EMR version 5.17.0.

Release 5.12.1 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for Amazon EMR release version 5.12.1. Changes are relative to 5.12.0.
Initial release date: March 29, 2018
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 Updated the Amazon Linux kernel of the default Amazon Linux AMI for Amazon EMR to address potential vulnerabilities.
Release 5.12.1 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

Release 5.12.0 Application Versions
The following applications are supported in this release: Flink, Ganglia, Hadoop, HBase, HCatalog, Hive, Hue, Livy, Mahout, MXNet, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Presto, Spark, Sqoop, Tez, Zeppelin, and ZooKeeper.
The diagram below depicts the application versions available in this release of Amazon EMR and the application versions in the preceding four Amazon EMR releases.

Release 5.12.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for the Amazon EMR release version 5.12.0. Changes are relative to 5.11.1.
Upgrades
 AWS SDK for Java 1.11.238 ⇒ 1.11.267. For more information, see the AWS SDK for Java Change Log on GitHub.
 Hadoop 2.7.3 ⇒ 2.8.3. For more information, see Apache Hadoop Releases.
 Flink 1.3.2 ⇒ 1.4.0. For more information, see the Apache Flink 1.4.0 Release Announcement.
 HBase 1.3.1 ⇒ 1.4.0. For more information, see the HBase Release Announcement.
 Hue 4.0.1 ⇒ 4.1.0. For more information, see the Release Notes.
 MxNet 0.12.0 ⇒ 1.0.0. For more information, see the MXNet Change Log on GitHub.
 Presto 0.187 ⇒ 0.188. For more information, see the Release Notes.
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 Hadoop
   The yarn.resourcemanager.decommissioning.timeout property has changed to yarn.resourcemanager.nodemanager-graceful-decommission-timeout-secs. You can use this property to customize cluster scale-down. For more information, see Cluster Scale-Down in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
   The Hadoop CLI added the -d option to the cp (copy) command, which specifies direct copy. You can use this to avoid creating an intermediary .COPYING file, which makes copying data between Amazon S3 faster. For more information, see HADOOP-12384.
 Pig
   Added the pig-env configuration classification, which simplifies the configuration of Pig environment properties. For more information, see Configuring Applications.
 Presto
   Added the presto-connector-redshift configuration classification, which you can use to configure values in the Presto redshift.properties configuration file. For more information, see Redshift Connector in Presto documentation, and Configuring Applications.
   Presto support for EMRFS has been added and is the default configuration. Earlier Amazon EMR release versions used PrestoS3FileSystem, which was the only option. For more information, see EMRFS and PrestoS3FileSystem Configuration.
Note
A configuration issue can cause Presto errors when querying underlying data in Amazon S3 with Amazon EMR release version 5.12.0. This is because Presto fails to pick up configuration classification values from emrfs-site.xml. As a workaround, create an emrfs subdirectory under usr/lib/presto/plugin/hive-hadoop2/, create a symlink in usr/lib/presto/plugin/hive-hadoop2/emrfs to the existing /usr/share/aws/emr/emrfs/conf/emrfs-site.xml file, and then restart the presto-server process (sudo presto-server stop followed by sudo presto-server start).
 Spark
   Backported SPARK-22036: BigDecimal multiplication sometimes returns null.
Known Issues
 MXNet does not include OpenCV libraries.
 SparkR is not available for clusters created using a custom AMI because R is not installed by default on cluster nodes.

Release 5.11.1 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for the Amazon EMR 5.11.1 release. Changes are relative to the Amazon EMR 5.8.0 release.
Initial release date: January 22, 2018
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 Updated the Amazon Linux kernel of the default Amazon Linux AMI for Amazon EMR to address vulnerabilities associated with speculative execution (CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753, and CVE-2017-5754). For more information, see https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2018-013/.
Release 5.11.1 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

Release 5.11.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for the Amazon EMR release version 5.11.0. Changes are relative to 5.10.0.
Upgrades
 Hive 2.3.2
 Spark 2.2.1
 SDK for Java 1.11.238
New Features
 Spark
   Added spark.decommissioning.timeout.threshold setting, which improves Spark decommissioning behavior when using Spot Instances. For more information, see Configuring Node Decommissioning Behavior.
   Added the aws-sagemaker-spark-sdk component to Spark, which installs Amazon SageMaker Spark and associated dependencies for Spark integration with Amazon SageMaker. You can use Amazon SageMaker Spark to construct Spark machine learning (ML) pipelines using Amazon SageMaker stages. For more information, see the SageMaker Spark Readme on GitHub and Using Apache Spark with Amazon SageMaker in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
Known Issues
 MXNet does not include OpenCV libraries.
 Hive 2.3.2 sets hive.compute.query.using.stats=true by default. This causes queries to get data from existing statistics rather than directly from data, which could be confusing. For example, if you have a table with hive.compute.query.using.stats=true and upload new files to the table LOCATION, running a SELECT COUNT(*) query on the table returns the count from the statistics, rather than picking up the added rows.
As a workaround, use the ANALYZE TABLE command to gather new statistics, or set hive.compute.query.using.stats=false. For more information, see Statistics in Hive in the Apache Hive documentation.

Release 5.10.0 Application Versions
The following applications are supported in this release: Flink, Ganglia, Hadoop, HBase, HCatalog, Hive, Hue, Livy, Mahout, MXNet, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Presto, Spark, Sqoop, Tez, Zeppelin, and ZooKeeper.
The diagram below depicts the application versions available in this release of Amazon EMR and the application versions in the preceding four Amazon EMR releases.
For a comprehensive history of application versions for each release of Amazon EMR, see the following diagrams:
 Application Versions for 5.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)
 Application Versions for 4.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)

Release 5.10.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for the Amazon EMR version 5.10.0 release. Changes are relative to the Amazon EMR 5.9.0 release.
Upgrades
 AWS SDK for Java 1.11.221
 Hive 2.3.1
 Presto 0.187
New Features
 Added support for Kerberos authentication. For more information, see Use Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon EMR Management Guide
 Added support for IAM roles for EMRFS. For more information, see Configure IAM Roles for EMRFS Requests to Amazon S3 in the Amazon EMR Management Guide
 Added support for GPU-based P2 and P3 instance types. For more information, see Amazon EC2 P2 Instances and Amazon EC2 P3 Instances. NVIDIA driver 384.81 and CUDA driver 9.0.176 are installed on these instance types by default.
 Added support for Apache MXNet.
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 Presto
   Added support for using the AWS Glue Data Catalog as the default Hive metastore. For more information, see Using Presto with the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
   Added support for geospatial functions.
   Added spill to disk support for joins.
   Added support for the Redshift connector.
 Spark
   Backported SPARK-20640, which makes the rpc timeout and the retries for shuffle registration values configurable using spark.shuffle.registration.timeout and spark.shuffle.registration.maxAttempts properties.
   Backported SPARK-21549, which corrects an error that occurs when writing custom OutputFormat to non-HDFS locations.
 Backported Hadoop-13270
 The Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib libraries have been removed from the base Amazon EMR AMI. If these libraries are required for your application, they are available in the application repository, so you can use a bootstrap action to install them on all nodes using yum install.
 The Amazon EMR base AMI no longer has application RPM packages included, so the RPM packages are no longer present on cluster nodes. Custom AMIs and the Amazon EMR base AMI now reference the RPM package repository in Amazon S3.
 Because of the introduction of per-second billing in Amazon EC2, the default Scale down behavior is now Terminate at task completion rather than Terminate at instance hour. For more information, see Configure Cluster Scale-Down.
Known Issues
 MXNet does not include OpenCV libraries.
 Hive 2.3.1 sets hive.compute.query.using.stats=true by default. This causes queries to get data from existing statistics rather than directly from data, which could be confusing. For example, if you have a table with hive.compute.query.using.stats=true and upload new files to the table LOCATION, running a SELECT COUNT(*) query on the table returns the count from the statistics, rather than picking up the added rows.
As a workaround, use the ANALYZE TABLE command to gather new statistics, or set hive.compute.query.using.stats=false. For more information, see Statistics in Hive in the Apache Hive documentation.
Release 5.10.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

The following applications are supported in this release: Flink, Ganglia, Hadoop, HBase, HCatalog, Hive, Hue, Livy, Mahout, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Presto, Spark, Sqoop, Tez, Zeppelin, and ZooKeeper.
The diagram below depicts the application versions available in this release of Amazon EMR and the application versions in the preceding four Amazon EMR releases.

Release 5.9.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for the Amazon EMR version 5.9.0 release. Changes are relative to the Amazon EMR 5.8.0 release.
Release date: October 5, 2017
Latest feature update: October 12, 2017
Upgrades
 AWS SDK for Java version 1.11.183
 Flink 1.3.2
 Hue 4.0.1
 Pig 0.17.0
 Presto 0.184
New Features
 Added Livy support (version 0.4.0-incubating). For more information, see Apache Livy.
 Added support for Hue Notebook for Spark.
 Added support for i3-series Amazon EC2 instances (October 12, 2017).
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 Spark
   Added a new set of features that help ensure Spark handles node termination because of a manual resize or an automatic scaling policy request more gracefully. For more information, see Configuring Node Decommissioning Behavior.
   SSL is used instead of 3DES for in-transit encryption for the block transfer service, which enhances performance when using Amazon EC2 instance types with AES-NI.
   Backported SPARK-21494.
 Zeppelin
   Backported ZEPPELIN-2377.
 HBase
   Added patch HBASE-18533, which allows additional values for HBase BucketCache configuration using the hbase-site configuration classification.
 Hue
   Added AWS Glue Data Catalog support for the Hive query editor in Hue.
   By default, superusers in Hue can access all files that Amazon EMR IAM roles are allowed to access. Newly created users do not automatically have permissions to access the Amazon S3 filebrowser and must have the filebrowser.s3_access permissions enabled for their group.
 Resolved an issue that caused underlying JSON data created using AWS Glue Data Catalog to be inaccessible.
Known Issues
 Cluster launch fails when all applications are installed and the default Amazon EBS root volume size is not changed. As a workaround, use the aws emr create-cluster command from the AWS CLI and specify a larger --ebs-root-volume-size parameter.
 Hive 2.3.0 sets hive.compute.query.using.stats=true by default. This causes queries to get data from existing statistics rather than directly from data, which could be confusing. For example, if you have a table with hive.compute.query.using.stats=true and upload new files to the table LOCATION, running a SELECT COUNT(*) query on the table returns the count from the statistics, rather than picking up the added rows.
As a workaround, use the ANALYZE TABLE command to gather new statistics, or set hive.compute.query.using.stats=false. For more information, see Statistics in Hive in the Apache Hive documentation.

Release 5.8.0 Application Versions
The following applications are supported in this release: Flink, Ganglia, Hadoop, HBase, HCatalog, Hive, Hue, Mahout, Oozie, Phoenix, Pig, Presto, Spark, Sqoop, Tez, Zeppelin, and ZooKeeper.
The diagram below depicts the application versions available in this release of Amazon EMR and the application versions in the preceding four Amazon EMR releases.
For a comprehensive history of application versions for each release of Amazon EMR, see the following diagrams:
 Application Versions for 5.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)
 Application Versions for 4.x Series Amazon EMR Releases (PNG)

Release 5.8.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for the Amazon EMR version 5.8.0 release. Changes are relative to the Amazon EMR 5.7.0 release.
Initial release date: August 10, 2017
Latest feature update: September 25, 2017
Upgrades
 AWS SDK 1.11.160
 Flink 1.3.1
 Hive 2.3.0. For more information, see Release Notes on the Apache Hive site.
 Spark 2.2.0. For more information, see Release Notes on the Apache Spark site.
New Features
 Added support for viewing application history (September 25, 2017). For more information, see Viewing Application History in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 Integration with AWS Glue Data Catalog
   Added ability for Hive and Spark SQL to use AWS Glue Data Catalog as the Hive metadata store. For more information, see Using the AWS Glue Data Catalog as the Metastore for Hive and Using the AWS Glue Data Catalog as the Metastore for Spark SQL.
 Added Application history to cluster details, which allows you to view historical data for YARN applications and additional details for Spark applications. For more information, see View Application History in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
 Oozie
   Backported OOZIE-2748.
 Hue
   Backported HUE-5859
 HBase
   Added patch to expose the HBase master server start time through Java Management Extensions (JMX) using getMasterInitializedTime.
   Added patch that improves cluster start time.
Known Issues
 Cluster launch fails when all applications are installed and the default Amazon EBS root volume size is not changed. As a workaround, use the aws emr create-cluster command from the AWS CLI and specify a larger --ebs-root-volume-size parameter.
 Hive 2.3.0 sets hive.compute.query.using.stats=true by default. This causes queries to get data from existing statistics rather than directly from data, which could be confusing. For example, if you have a table with hive.compute.query.using.stats=true and upload new files to the table LOCATION, running a SELECT COUNT(*) query on the table returns the count from the statistics, rather than picking up the added rows.
As a workaround, use the ANALYZE TABLE command to gather new statistics, or set hive.compute.query.using.stats=false. For more information, see Statistics in Hive in the Apache Hive documentation.
 Spark—When using Spark, there is a file handler leak issue with the apppusher daemon, which can appear for a long-running Spark job after several hours or days. To fix the issue, connect to the master node and type sudo /etc/init.d/apppusher stop. This stops that apppusher daemon, which Amazon EMR will restart automatically.
 Application history
   Historical data for dead Spark executors is not available.
   Application history is not available for clusters that use a security configuration to enable in-flight encryption.

Release 5.5.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for the Amazon EMR 5.5.0 release. Changes are relative to the Amazon EMR 5.4.0 release.
Release date: April 26, 2017
Upgrades
 Hue 3.12
 Presto 0.170
 Zeppelin 0.7.1
 ZooKeeper 3.4.10
Changes, Enhancements, and Resolved Issues
 Spark
   Backported Spark Patch (SPARK-20115) Fix DAGScheduler to recompute all the lost shuffle blocks when external shuffle service is unavailable to version 2.1.0 of Spark, which is included in this release.
 Flink
   Flink is now built with Scala 2.11. If you use the Scala API and libraries, we recommend that you use Scala 2.11 in your projects.
   Addressed an issue where HADOOP_CONF_DIR and YARN_CONF_DIR defaults were not properly set, so start-scala-shell.sh failed to work. Also added the ability to set these values using env.hadoop.conf.dir and env.yarn.conf.dir in /etc/flink/conf/flink-conf.yaml or the flink-conf configuration classification.
   Introduced a new EMR-specific command, flink-scala-shell as a wrapper for start-scala-shell.sh. We recommend using this command instead of start-scala-shell. The new command simplifies execution. For example, flink-scala-shell -n 2 starts a Flink Scala shell with a task parallelism of 2.
   Introduced a new EMR-specific command, flink-yarn-session as a wrapper for yarn-session.sh. We recommend using this command instead of yarn-session. The new command simplifies execution. For example, flink-yarn-session -n 2 -d starts a long-running Flink session in a detached state with two task managers. 
   Addressed (FLINK-6125) Commons httpclient is not shaded anymore in Flink 1.2.
 Presto
   Added support for LDAP authentication. Using LDAP with Presto on Amazon EMR requires that you enable HTTPS access for the Presto coordinator (http-server.https.enabled=true in config.properties). For configuration details, see LDAP Authentication in Presto documentation.
   Added support for SHOW GRANTS.
 Amazon EMR Base Linux AMI
   Amazon EMR releases are now based on Amazon Linux 2017.03. For more information, see Amazon Linux AMI 2017.03 Release Notes.
   Removed Python 2.6 from the Amazon EMR base Linux image. Python 2.7 and 3.4 are installed by default. You can install Python 2.6 manually if necessary.

Release 5.4.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for the Amazon EMR 5.4.0 release. Changes are relative to the Amazon EMR 5.3.0 release.
Release date: March 08, 2017
Upgrades
 Upgraded to Flink 1.2.0
 Upgraded to HBase 1.3.0
 Upgraded to Phoenix 4.9.0
Note
If you upgrade from an earlier version of Amazon EMR to Amazon EMR version 5.4.0 or later and use secondary indexing, upgrade local indexes as described in the Apache Phoenix documentation. Amazon EMR removes the required configurations from the hbase-site classification, but indexes need to be repopulated. Online and offline upgrade of indexes are supported. Online upgrades are the default, which means indexes are repopulated while initializing from Phoenix clients of version 4.8.0 or greater. To specify offline upgrades, set the phoenix.client.localIndexUpgrade configuration to false in the phoenix-site classification, and then SSH to the master node to run psql [zookeeper] -1.
 Upgraded to Presto 0.166
 Upgraded to Zeppelin 0.7.0
Changes and Enhancements
 Added support for r4 instances. See Amazon EC2 Instance Types.
Release 5.4.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

Release 5.2.1 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for the Amazon EMR 5.2.1 release. Changes are relative to the Amazon EMR 5.2.0 release.
Release date: December 29, 2016
Upgrades
 Upgraded to Presto 0.157.1. For more information, see Presto Release Notes in the Presto documentation. 
 Upgraded to Zookeeper 3.4.9. For more information, see ZooKeeper Release Notes in the Apache ZooKeeper documentation.
Changes and Enhancements
 Added support for the Amazon EC2 m4.16xlarge instance type in Amazon EMR version 4.8.3 and later, excluding 5.0.0, 5.0.3, and 5.2.0.
 Amazon EMR releases are now based on Amazon Linux 2016.09. For more information, see https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2016.09-release-notes/.
 The location of Flink and YARN configuration paths are now set by default in /etc/default/flink that you do not need to set the environment variables FLINK_CONF_DIR and HADOOP_CONF_DIR when running the flink or yarn-session.sh driver scripts to launch Flink jobs.
 Added support for FlinkKinesisConsumer class.
Known Issues Resolved from the Previous Releases
 Fixed an issue in Hadoop where the ReplicationMonitor thread could get stuck for a long time because of a race between replication and deletion of the same file in a large cluster.
 Fixed an issue where ControlledJob#toString failed with a null pointer exception (NPE) when job status was not successfully updated.
Release 5.2.1 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

Release 5.2.0 Release Notes
The following release notes include information for the Amazon EMR 5.2.0 release. Changes are relative to the Amazon EMR 5.1.0 release.
Release date: November 21, 2016
Changes and enhancements
 Added Amazon S3 storage mode for HBase.
  Enables you to specify an Amazon S3 location for the HBase rootdir. For more information, see HBase on Amazon S3.
Upgrades
 Upgraded to Spark 2.0.2
Known Issues Resolved from the Previous Releases
 Fixed an issue with /mnt being constrained to 2 TB on EBS-only instance types.
 Fixed an issue with instance-controller and logpusher logs being output to their corresponding .out files instead of to their normal log4j-configured .log files, which rotate hourly. The .out files do not rotate, so this would eventually fill up the /emr partition. This issue only affects hardware virtual machine (HVM) instance types.
Release 5.2.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.

Release 5.0.0 Release Notes
Release date: July 27, 2016
Upgrades
 Upgraded to Hive 2.1
 Upgraded to Presto 0.150
 Upgraded to Spark 2.0
 Upgraded to Hue 3.10.0
 Upgraded to Pig 0.16.0
 Upgraded to Tez 0.8.4
 Upgraded to Zeppelin 0.6.1
Changes and Enhancements
 Amazon EMR supports the latest open-source versions of Hive (version 2.1) and Pig (version 0.16.0). If you have used Hive or Pig on Amazon EMR in the past, this may affect some use cases. For more information, see Hive and Pig.
 The default execution engine for Hive and Pig is now Tez. To change this, you would edit the appropriate values in the hive-site and pig-properties configuration classifications, respectively.
 An enhanced step debugging feature was added, which allows you to see the root cause of step failures if the service can determine the cause. For more information, see  Enhanced Step Debugging in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.
 Applications that previously ended with "-Sandbox" no longer have that suffix. This may break your automation, for example, if you are using scripts to launch clusters with these applications. The following table shows application names in Amazon EMR 4.7.2 versus Amazon EMR 5.0.0. 
Application name changes 
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
 Spark is now compiled for Scala 2.11.
 Java 8 is now the default JVM. All applications run using the Java 8 runtime. There are no changes to any application’s byte code target. Most applications continue to target Java 7.
 Zeppelin now includes authentication features. For more information, see Zeppelin.
 Added support for security configurations, which allow you to create and apply encryption options more easily. For more information, see Data Encryption.
Release 5.0.0 Component Versions
The components that Amazon EMR installs with this release are listed below. Some are installed as part of big-data application packages. Others are unique to Amazon EMR and installed for system processes and features. These typically start with emr or aws. Big-data application packages in the most recent Amazon EMR release are usually the latest version found in the community. We make community releases available in Amazon EMR as quickly as possible.
Some components need changes from community versions for Amazon EMR. These components have a version label in the form CommunityVersion-amzn-EmrVersion. For example, if a big-data community component named myapp-component of version 2.2 has been modified three times for inclusion in different Amazon EMR release versions, its release version is listed as 2.2-amzn-3.
