Apache Tez
Apache Tez is a framework for creating a complex directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks for processing data. In some cases, it is used as an alternative to Hadoop MapReduce. For example, Pig and Hive workflows can run using Hadoop MapReduce or they can use Tez as an execution engine. For more information, see https://tez.apache.org/. Tez is included in Amazon EMR release version 4.7.0 and later.
