Replacing compromised credentials
If you believe that the tunnel credentials for your Site-to-Site VPN connection have been compromised, you can change the IKE pre-shared key or change the ACM certificate. The method you use depends on the authentication option you used for your VPN tunnels. For more information, see Site-to-Site VPN tunnel authentication options.
To change the IKE pre-shared key
You can modify the tunnel options for the Site-to-Site VPN connection and specify a new IKE pre-shared key for each tunnel. For more information, see Modifying Site-to-Site VPN tunnel options.
Alternatively, you can delete the Site-to-Site VPN connection. For more information, see Deleting a Site-to-Site VPN connection. You don't need to delete the VPC or the virtual private gateway. Then, create a new Site-to-Site VPN connection using the same virtual private gateway, and configure the new keys on your customer gateway device. You can specify your own pre-shared keys for the tunnels or let AWS generate new pre-shared keys for you. For more information, see Create a Site-to-Site VPN connection. The tunnel's inside and outside addresses might change when you recreate the Site-to-Site VPN connection.
To change the certificate for the AWS side of the tunnel endpoint
Rotate the certificate. For more information, see Rotating Site-to-Site VPN tunnel endpoint certificates.
To change the certificate on the customer gateway device


Create a new certificate. For information about creating an ACM certificate, see Getting started in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.


Add the certificate to the customer gateway device.
