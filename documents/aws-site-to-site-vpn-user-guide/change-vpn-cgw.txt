Changing the customer gateway for a Site-to-Site VPN connection
You can change the customer gateway of your Site-to-Site VPN connection by using the Amazon VPC console or a command line tool. 
After you change the customer gateway, your Site-to-Site VPN connection will be temporarily unavailable for a brief period while we provision the new endpoints.
To change the customer gateway using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Site-to-Site VPN Connections.


Select the Site-to-Site VPN connection, and then choose Actions, Modify VPN Connection.


For Target Type, choose Customer Gateway.


For Target Customer Gateway ID, choose the ID for the customer gateway that you want to use for the connection.
