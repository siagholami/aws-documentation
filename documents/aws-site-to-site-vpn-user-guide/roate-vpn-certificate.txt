Rotating Site-to-Site VPN tunnel endpoint certificates
You can rotate the certificates on the tunnel endpoints on the AWS side by using the Amazon VPC console. When a tunnel endpointâ€™s certificate is close to expiration, AWS automatically rotates the certificate using the service-linked role. For more information, see Permissions granted by the service-linked role.
