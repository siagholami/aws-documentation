Identifying a Site-to-Site VPN connection
You can find out the category of your Site-to-Site VPN connection by using the Amazon VPC console or a command line tool. 
To identify the Site-to-Site VPN category using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Site-to-Site VPN Connections.


Select the Site-to-Site VPN connection, and check the value for Category in the details pane. A value of VPN indicates an AWS VPN connection. A value of VPN-Classic indicates an AWS Classic VPN connection.


To identify the Site-to-Site VPN category using a command line tool
 You can use the describe-vpn-connections AWS CLI command. In the output that's returned, take note of the Category value. A value of VPN indicates an AWS VPN connection. A value of VPN-Classic indicates an AWS Classic VPN connection.
In the following example, the Site-to-Site VPN connection is an AWS VPN connection.
aws ec2 describe-vpn-connections --vpn-connection-ids vpn-1a2b3c4d
```
  {
      "VpnConnections": [
          {
              "VpnConnectionId": "vpn-1a2b3c4d", 
          ...

          "State": "available", 
          "VpnGatewayId": "vgw-11aa22bb", 
          "CustomerGatewayId": "cgw-ab12cd34", 
          "Type": "ipsec.1",
          "Category": "VPN"
      }
  ]

}
  ```
