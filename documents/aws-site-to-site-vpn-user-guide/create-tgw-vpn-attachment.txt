Creating a transit gateway VPN attachment
To create a VPN attachment on a transit gateway, you must specify the customer gateway. For more information about creating a transit gateway, see Transit gateways in Amazon VPC Transit Gateways.
To create a VPN attachment using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Site-to-Site VPN Connections.


Choose Create VPN Connection.


For Target Gateway Type, choose Transit Gateway, and choose the transit gateway on which to create the attachment.


For Customer Gateway, do one of the following:
    To use an existing customer gateway, choose Existing, and then select the gateway to use.
If your customer gateway is behind a network address translation (NAT) device that's enabled for NAT traversal (NAT-T), use the public IP address of your NAT device, and adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
    To create a customer gateway, choose New. 
For IP Address, enter a static public IP address. For BGP ASN, enter the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) of your customer gateway. For Certificate ARN, choose the ARN of your private certificate (if using certificate-based authentication).
For Routing options, choose whether to use Dynamic or Static.


(Optional) For Enable Acceleration, select the check box to enable acceleration. For more information, see Accelerated Site-to-Site VPN connections.


If you enable acceleration, we create two accelerators that are used by your VPN connection. Additional charges apply.


For Tunnel Options, see Tunnel options for your Site-to-Site VPN connection.


Choose Create VPN Connection.
