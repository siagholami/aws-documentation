Amazon ECR repositories
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) provides API operations to create, monitor, and delete image repositories and set permissions that control who can access them. You can perform the same actions in the Repositories section of the Amazon ECR console. Amazon ECR also integrates with the Docker CLI allowing you to push and pull images from your development environments to your repositories.

Repository concepts

By default, your account has read and write access to the repositories in your default registry (aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com). However, IAM users require permissions to make calls to the Amazon ECR APIs and to push or pull images from your repositories. Amazon ECR provides several managed policies to control user access at varying levels; for more information, see Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity-Based Policy Examples.
Repositories can be controlled with both IAM user access policies and repository policies. For more information, see Repository policies.
Repository names can support namespaces, which you can use to group similar repositories. For example if there are several teams using the same registry, Team A could use the team-a namespace while Team B uses the team-b namespace. Each team could have their own image called web-app, but because they are each prefaced with the team namespace, the two images can be used simultaneously without interference. Team A's image would be called team-a/web-app, while Team B's image would be called team-b/web-app.
