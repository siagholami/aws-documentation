Viewing repository information
After you have created a repository, you can view its information in the AWS Management Console: 
 Which images are stored in a repository
 Whether an image is tagged
 The tags for the image
 The SHA digest for the images
 The size of the images in MiB
 When the image was pushed to the repository
Note
Beginning with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client compresses image layers before pushing them to a V2 Docker registry. The output of the docker images command shows the uncompressed image size, so it may return a larger image size than the image sizes shown in the AWS Management Console.
To view repository information


Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.


From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the repository to view.


In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.


On the Repositories page, choose the repository to view.


On the Repositories : repository_name page, use the navigation bar to view information about an image.
    Choose Images to view information about the images in the repository. If there are untagged images that you would like to delete, you can select the box to the left of the repositories to delete and choose Delete. For more information, see Deleting an image.
    Choose Permissions to view the repository policies that are applied to the repository. For more information, see Repository policies.
    Choose Lifecycle Policy to view the lifecycle policy rules that are applied to the repository. The lifecycle events history is also viewed here. For more information, see Lifecycle policies.
