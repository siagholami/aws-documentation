Deleting a repository
If you are done using a repository, you can delete it. When you delete a repository in the AWS Management Console, all of the images contained in the repository are also deleted; this cannot be undone.
To delete a repository


Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.


From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the repository to delete.


In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.


On the Repositories page, select the repository to delete and choose Delete.


In the Delete repository_name window, verify that the selected repositories should be deleted and choose Delete.
Important
Any images in the selected repositories are also deleted.
