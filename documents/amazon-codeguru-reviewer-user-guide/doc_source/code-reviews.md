# Working with code reviews<a name="code-reviews"></a>

When you submit a pull request or run an analysis on a repository that is associated with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer, CodeGuru Reviewer provides recommendations for how to improve your code in code reviews\. Each pull request or repository analysis corresponds to a code review, and each code review can include multiple recommendations\. You can see recommendations directly in the CodeGuru Reviewer console **Code reviews** page\. For pull request code reviews, you can also see recommendations as comments on a pull request\. 

You can do the following on the **Code reviews** page in the CodeGuru console: 
+ View all code reviews from the past 90 days
+ Navigate directly to pull requests and repositories that the code reviews were performed on
+ View details about code reviews and whether they are completed
+ View all the recommendations of each code review directly in the console
+ Provide feedback to indicate which recommendations were helpful and which recommendations were not helpful

Your feedback on recommendations is crucial to helping CodeGuru Reviewer improve its recommendations\. You can use the **Code Reviews** page to give feedback on recommendations by choosing the name of the repository and then choosing thumbs\-up or thumbs\-down icons\.
