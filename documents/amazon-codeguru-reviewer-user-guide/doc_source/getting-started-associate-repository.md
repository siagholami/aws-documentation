# Step 2: Associate a repository<a name="getting-started-associate-repository"></a>

 You must create a repository assocation to grant CodeGuru Reviewer access to read your source code and create notifications on your repository\. The notifications trigger analysis on updated source code every time you create a pull request\. For more information, see [Working with repository associations in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer](working-with-repositories.md)\.

**Note**  
The source code reviewed by CodeGuru Reviewer is not stored\. For more information, see [Captured data in CodeGuru Reviewer](data-protection.md#data-captured)\.

 To create a repository association, choose one of the following\. 
+  If your repository type is AWS CodeCommit, see [ Create a CodeCommit repository association](create-codecommit-association.md)\. 
+  If your repository type is Bitbucket, see [ Create a Bitbucket repository association](create-bitbucket-association.md)\. 
+  If your repository type is GitHub, see [ Create a GitHub repository association](create-github-association.md)\. 
+  If your repository type is GitHub Enterprise Server, see [ Create a GitHub Enterprise Server repository association](create-github-enterprise-association.md)\.
