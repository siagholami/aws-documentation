You should know the following about Amazon Web Services \(AWS\): 
+ When you sign up for AWS, your AWS account automatically has access to all services in AWS, including CodeGuru Reviewer\. However, you are charged only for the services that you use\. 
+ With CodeGuru Reviewer, you pay only for analysis of lines of code that change or are new in pull requests\. For more information, see [Amazon CodeGuru pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/codeguru/pricing/)\.
