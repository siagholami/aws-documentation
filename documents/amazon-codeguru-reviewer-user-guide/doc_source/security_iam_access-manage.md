# Managing access using policies<a name="security_iam_access-manage"></a>

You control access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities or AWS resources\. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions\. AWS evaluates these policies when an entity \(root user, IAM user, or IAM role\) makes a request\. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied\. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents\. For more information about the structure and contents of JSON policy documents, see [Overview of JSON Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

An IAM administrator can use policies to specify who has access to AWS resources, and what actions they can perform on those resources\. Every IAM entity \(user or role\) starts with no permissions\. In other words, by default, users can do nothing, not even change their own password\. To give a user permission to do something, an administrator must attach a permissions policy to a user\. Or the administrator can add the user to a group that has the intended permissions\. When an administrator gives permissions to a group, all users in that group are granted those permissions\.

IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation\. For example, suppose that you have a policy that allows the `iam:GetRole` action\. A user with that policy can get role information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API\.

## Identity\-based policies<a name="security_iam_access-manage-id-based-policies"></a>

Identity\-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, such as an IAM user, role, or group\. These policies control what actions that identity can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions\. To learn how to create an identity\-based policy, see [Creating IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

Identity\-based policies can be further categorized as *inline policies* or *managed policies*\. Inline policies are embedded directly into a single user, group, or role\. Managed policies are standalone policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account\. Managed policies include AWS managed policies and customer managed policies\. To learn how to choose between a managed policy or an inline policy, see [Choosing Between Managed Policies and Inline Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#choosing-managed-or-inline) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Resource\-based policies<a name="security_iam_access-manage-resource-based-policies"></a>

Resource\-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource such as an Amazon S3 bucket\. Service administrators can use these policies to define what actions a specified principal \(account member, user, or role\) can perform on that resource and under what conditions\. Resource\-based policies are inline policies\. There are no managed resource\-based policies\.

## Access control lists \(ACLs\)<a name="security_iam_access-manage-acl"></a>

Access control lists \(ACLs\) are a type of policy that controls which principals \(account members, users, or roles\) have permissions to access a resource\. ACLs are similar to resource\-based policies, although they do not use the JSON policy document format\. Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC are examples of services that support ACLs\. To learn more about ACLs, see [Access Control List \(ACL\) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*\.

## Other policy types<a name="security_iam_access-manage-other-policies"></a>

AWS supports additional, less\-common policy types\. These policy types can set the maximum permissions granted to you by the more common policy types\. 
+ **Permissions boundaries** – A permissions boundary is an advanced feature in which you set the maximum permissions that an identity\-based policy can grant to an IAM entity \(IAM user or role\)\. You can set a permissions boundary for an entity\. The resulting permissions are the intersection of entity's identity\-based policies and its permissions boundaries\. Resource\-based policies that specify the user or role in the `Principal` field are not limited by the permissions boundary\. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow\. For more information about permissions boundaries, see [Permissions Boundaries for IAM Entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ **Service control policies \(SCPs\)** – SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit \(OU\) in AWS Organizations\. AWS Organizations is a service for grouping and centrally managing multiple AWS accounts that your business owns\. If you enable all features in an organization, then you can apply service control policies \(SCPs\) to any or all of your accounts\. The SCP limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including each AWS account root user\. For more information about Organizations and SCPs, see [How SCPs Work](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_about-scps.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*\.
+ **Session policies** – Session policies are advanced policies that you pass as a parameter when you programmatically create a temporary session for a role or federated user\. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the user or role's identity\-based policies and the session policies\. Permissions can also come from a resource\-based policy\. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow\. For more information, see [Session Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

## Multiple policy types<a name="security_iam_access-manage-multiple-policies"></a>

When multiple types of policies apply to a request, the resulting permissions are more complicated to understand\. To learn how AWS determines whether to allow a request when multiple policy types are involved, see [Policy Evaluation Logic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
