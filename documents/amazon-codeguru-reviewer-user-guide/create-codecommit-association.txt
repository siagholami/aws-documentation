Create an AWS CodeCommit repository association in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer
You can create an AWS CodeCommit repository association using the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer console, the AWS CLI, or the CodeGuru Reviewer SDK. Before you create a CodeCommit repository association, you must have a CodeCommit repository in the same AWS account and Region in which you want your CodeGuru Reviewer code reviews. For more information, see Create an AWS CodeCommit repository in the AWS CodeCommit User Guide.

To create a CodeCommit repository association


Open the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/reviewer/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Associated repositories. 


Choose Associate repository. 


Choose AWS CodeCommit. 


From Repository location, choose your CodeCommit repository, then choose Associate. On the Associated repositories page, the Status is Associating. When the association is complete, the status changes to Associated and you can create a pull request or a repository analysis to get recommendations. Refresh the page to check for the status change. 


Create a CodeCommit repository association (AWS CLI)
For information about using the AWS CLI with CodeGuru Reviewer, see the CodeGuru Reviewer section of the AWS CLI Command Reference. 
To create a CodeCommit repository association

Make sure that you have configured the AWS CLI with the AWS Region in which want to create your code reviews and in which your CodeCommit repository exists. To verify the Region, run the following command at the command line or terminal and review the information for the default name. 

aws configure
The default region name must match the AWS Region for the repository in CodeCommit. 

Run the associate-repository command specifying the name of the CodeCommit repository you want to associate. 

aws codeguru-reviewer associate-repository --repository CodeCommit={Name=my-codecommit-repo}

If successful, this command outputs a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_RepositoryAssociation.html object. 

{
       "RepositoryAssociation": {
           "AssociationId": "repository-association-uuid",
           "Name": "my-codecommit-repo",
           "LastUpdatedTimeStamp": 1595634764.029,
           "ProviderType": "CodeCommit",
           "CreatedTimeStamp": 1595634764.029,
           "Owner": "123456789012",
           "State": "Associating",
           "StateReason": "Pending Repository Association",
           "AssociationArn": "arn:aws:codeguru-reviewer:us-west-2:123456789012:association:repository-association-uuid",
       }
   }

When the associate-repository command succeeds, the status in the returned output is Associating. When the association is complete, the status changes to Associated and you can create a pull request or a repository analysis to get recommendations. You can check your repository association's status using the describe-repository command with its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). 

aws codeguru-reviewer describe-repository-association --association-arn arn:aws:codeguru-reviewer:us-west-2:123456789012:association:repository-association-uuid

If successful, this command outputs a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_RepositoryAssociation.html object which shows its status. 

{
       "RepositoryAssociation": {
           "AssociationId": "repository-association-uuid",
           "Name": "my-codecommit-repo",
           "LastUpdatedTimeStamp": 1595634764.029,
           "ProviderType": "CodeCommit",
           "CreatedTimeStamp": 1595634764.029,
           "Owner": "123456789012",
           "State": "Associated",
           "StateReason": ""Pull Request Notification configuration successful",
           "AssociationArn": "arn:aws:codeguru-reviewer:us-west-2:123456789012:association:repository-association-uuid"
       }
   }
