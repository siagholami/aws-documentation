GitHub Enterprise Server repository association prerequisites
To create a GitHub Enterprise Server repository association, you must have a GitHub Enterprise Server connection in AWS CodeStar connections. The connection must be in the same AWS account and Region in which you want your code reviews. For more information, see Create a connection and Create a connection to GitHub Enterprise Server in the Developer Tools User Guide. 
Your GitHub Enterprise Server connection requires a host. The host represents your GitHub Enterprise Server instance and is what your GitHub Enterprise Server connection connects to. A host can be an on-premises server or a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). For more information, see Amazon VPC configuration for your host and Create a host in the AWS Developer Tools User Guide. 
Create a GitHub Enterprise Server repository association (console)
To create a GitHub Enterprise Server repository association


Open the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/reviewer/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Associated repositories. 


Choose Associate repository. 


Choose GitHub Enterprise Server. 


From Connect to GitHub Enterprise Server (with AWS CodeStar Connections), choose the connection you want to use. If you don't have a connection, choose Create a GitHub Enterprise Server connection to create one in the Developer Tools console. For more information, see Create a connection in the AWS Developer Tools User Guide. 


From Repository location, choose the GitHub Enterprise Server repository, then choose Associate. On the Associated repositories page, the Status is Associating. When the association is complete, the status changes to Associated and you can create a pull request or a repository analysis to get recommendations. Refresh the page to check for the status change. 


Create a GitHub Enterprise Server repository association (AWS CLI)
For information about using the AWS CLI with CodeGuru Reviewer, see the CodeGuru Reviewer section of the AWS CLI Command Reference 
To create a GitHub Enterprise Server repository association

Make sure that you have configured the AWS CLI with the AWS Region in which you want to create your code reviews. To verify the Region, run the following command at the command line or terminal and review the information for the default name. 

aws configure

Run the associate-repository command specifying the owner (or user name) of your GitHub Enterprise Server account, the name of your repository, and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your connection. 

aws codeguru-reviewer associate-repository --repository GitHubEnterpriseServer="{Owner=github-enterprise-server-user-name, Name=repository-name, \
    ConnectionArn=arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-west-2:123456789012:connection/connection-uuid }"

If successful, this command outputs a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_RepositoryAssociation.html object. 

{
       "RepositoryAssociation": {
           "ProviderType": "GitHubEnterpriseServer",
           "Name": "repository-name",
           "LastUpdatedTimeStamp": 1595966211.79,
           "AssociationId": "repository-association-uuid",
           "CreatedTimeStamp": 1595966211.79,
           "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-west-2:123456789012:connection/connection-uuid",
           "State": "Associating",
           "StateReason": "Pending Repository Association",
           "AssociationArn": "arn:aws:codeguru-reviewer:us-east-2:123456789012:association:repository-association-uuid",
           "Owner": "github-enterprise-server-user-name"
       }
   }

When the associate-repository command succeeds, the status in the returned output is Associating. When the association is complete, the status changes to Associated and you can create a pull request or a repository analysis to get recommendations. You can check your repository association's status using the describe-repository command with its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). 

aws codeguru-reviewer describe-repository-association --association-arn arn:aws:codeguru-reviewer:us-west-2:123456789012:association:repository-association-uuid

If successful, this command outputs a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_RepositoryAssociation.html object which shows its status. 

{
       "RepositoryAssociation": {
           "ProviderType": "GitHubEnterpriseServer",
           "Name": "repository-name",
           "LastUpdatedTimeStamp": 1595634764.029,
           "AssociationId": "repository-association-uuid",
           "CreatedTimeStamp": 1595634764.029,
           "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-west-2:123456789012:connection/connection_uuid"
           "State": "Associated",
           "StateReason": "Pull Request Notification configuration successful",
           "AssociationArn": "arn:aws:codeguru-reviewer:us-west-2:123456789012:association:repository-association-uuid",
           "Owner": "github-enterprise-server-user-name"
       }
   }
Create a GitHub Enterprise Server repository association (AWS SDKs)
To create an GitHub Enterprise Server repository association with the AWS SDKs, use the AssociateRepository API. For more information, see AssociateRepository in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer API Reference.
