Create a repository for your source code
Before you use Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer to create code reviews, the source code that you want to analyze must be set up in a supported repository type. CodeGuru Reviewer supports AWS CodeCommit, Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitHub Enterprise Server. If you use Bitbucket or GitHub Enterprise Server, you must also create a connection to your repository using AWS CodeStar connections. For more information, see What are connections? in the AWS Developer Tools User Guide. 
After you know the repository type and the name of your repository, you need to create a repository association. For GitHub repositories, you can create a repository association using only the CodeGuru Reviewer console. For the other supported repository types, you can use the console, AWS CLI, or Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer SDK to create a repository association. For more information, see Working with repository associations in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer.
