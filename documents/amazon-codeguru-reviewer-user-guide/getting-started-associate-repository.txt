Step 2: Associate a repository
You must create a repository assocation to grant CodeGuru Reviewer access to read your source code and create notifications on your repository. The notifications trigger analysis on updated source code every time you create a pull request. For more information, see Working with repository associations in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer.
Note
The source code reviewed by CodeGuru Reviewer is not stored. For more information, see Captured data in CodeGuru Reviewer.
To create a repository association, choose one of the following. 
  If your repository type is AWS CodeCommit, see  Create a CodeCommit repository association. 
  If your repository type is Bitbucket, see  Create a Bitbucket repository association. 
  If your repository type is GitHub, see  Create a GitHub repository association. 
  If your repository type is GitHub Enterprise Server, see  Create a GitHub Enterprise Server repository association.
