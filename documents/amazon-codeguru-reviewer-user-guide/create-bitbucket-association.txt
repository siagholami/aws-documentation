Create a Bitbucket repository association in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer
You can create an Bitbucket repository association using the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer console, the AWS CLI, or the CodeGuru Reviewer SDK. Before you create a Bitbucket repository association, you must have a Bitbucket repository and you must create a connection to it using the Developer Tools console. For more information, see Create a connection in the Developer Tools User Guide. For information about creating a Bitbucket repository, see Create a Git repository on the Bitbucket website.

To create a Bitbucket repository association


Open the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/reviewer/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Associated repositories. 


Choose Associate repository. 


Choose Bitbucket. 


From Connect to Bitbucket (with AWS CodeStar Connections), choose the connection you want to use. If you don't have a connection, choose Create a Bitbucket connection to create one in the Developer Tools console. For more information, see Create a connection in the Developer Tools User Guide. 


From Repository location, choose the name of your Bitbucket repository that contains the source code you want CodeGuru Reviewer to review. 


From Repository location, choose your Bitbucket repository, then choose Associate. On the Associated repositories page, the Status is Associating. When the association is complete, the status changes to Associated and you can create a pull request or a repository analysis to get recommendations. Refresh the page to check for the status change. 


Create a Bitbucket repository association (AWS CLI)
For information about using the AWS CLI with CodeGuru Reviewer, see the CodeGuru Reviewer section of the AWS CLI Command Reference 
To create a Bitbucket repository association

Make sure that you have configured the AWS CLI with the AWS Region in which you want to create your code reviews. To verify the Region, run the following command at the command line or terminal and review the information for the default name. 

aws configure
The default Region name must match the AWS Region for the repository in CodeCommit\.


Run the associate-repository command specifying the owner (or user name) of your Bitbucket account, the name of your repository, and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your connection. 

aws codeguru-reviewer associate-repository --repository Bitbucket="{Owner=bitbucket-user-name, Name=repository-name, \
    ConnectionArn=arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-west-2:123456789012:connection/repository-uuid }"

If successful, this command outputs a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_RepositoryAssociation.html object. 

{
       "RepositoryAssociation": {
           "ProviderType": "Bitbucket",
           "Name": "repository-name",
           "LastUpdatedTimeStamp": 1595886585.96,
           "AssociationId": "repository_association_uuid",
           "CreatedTimeStamp": 1595886585.96,
           "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-west-2:544120495673:connection/connection_uuid",
           "State": "Associating",
           "StateReason": "Pending Repository Association",
           "AssociationArn": "arn:aws:codeguru-reviewer:us-west-2:123456789012:association:repository-association-uuid",
           "Owner": "bitbucket-user-name"
       }
   }

When the associate-repository command succeeds, the status in the returned output is Associating. When the association is complete, the status changes to Associated and you can create a pull request or a repository analysis to get recommendations. You can check your repository association's status using the describe-repository command with its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). 

aws codeguru-reviewer describe-repository-association --association-arn arn:aws:codeguru-reviewer:us-west-2:123456789012:association:repository-association-uuid

If successful, this command outputs a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_RepositoryAssociation.html object which shows its status. 

{
       "RepositoryAssociation": {
           "ProviderType": "Bitbucket",
           "Name": "repository-name",
           "LastUpdatedTimeStamp": 1595886585.96,
           "AssociationId": "repository_association_uuid",
           "CreatedTimeStamp": 1595886585.96,
           "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-west-2:544120495673:connection/connection_uuid",
           "State": "Associated",
           "StateReason": ""Pull Request Notification configuration successful",
           "AssociationArn": "arn:aws:codeguru-reviewer:us-west-2:123456789012:association:repository-association-uuid",
           "Owner": "bitbucket-user-name"
       }
   }
