Step 3: Get recommendations
Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer uses code reviews to provide different kinds of recommendations to help improve your code. These recommendations are focused on best practices and resolving potential defects in code that are difficult for developers to find. After a code review is successfully completed on a repository analysis or pull request, you can view recommendations. You can then choose whether to incorporate the recommendations, and you can provide feedback about whether the recommendations were helpful.
Note
We recommend that you use both CodeGuru Reviewer and traditional peer review processes during the code review stage. Using a combination of code review processes helps to identify more issues before they reach production.
The recommendations show up when a code review is completed. You can view the status of a code review on the Code reviews page on the CodeGuru Reviewer console. 
 Pending: While a code review status is Pending, it is important to maintain source provider access permissions and keep the pull request open. Keep the relevant branch accessible.
 Completed: The code review status usually shows as Completed after about 15 minutes when you refresh the page.
 Failed: If a code review status is Failed, you can view more details on the Code reviews page. Choose the code review that failed, choose Action, and then choose View code review details.
For more information, see View code review details.
