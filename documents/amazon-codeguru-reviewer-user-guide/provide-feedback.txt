Provide feedback using the CodeGuru Reviewer console
You can provide feedback for recommendations on pull request or repository analysis code reviews using the Code reviews page of the CodeGuru Reviewer console. Choose the name of a code review to view details and recommendations from that code review. Then choose the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icon under each recommendation to indicate whether the recommendation was helpful.
Provide feedback using pull request comments
You can also provide feedback for pull request scans by replying to comments in pull requests, without leaving your repository context. In AWS CodeCommit you can view the recommendations on the Activity or Changes tab. A thumbs-up or thumbs-down icon is provided next to comments made by CodeGuru Reviewer. Choose a thumbs-up icon if the recommendation was helpful and a thumbs-down icon if it wasn't. In other repository source providers, you can reply to a comment made by CodeGuru Reviewer, and include either a thumbs-up or thumbs-down emoji in your comment to indicate whether it was helpful or not.

Provide feedback using the CLI
You can also use the AWS CLI or the AWS SDK to provide feedback on recommendations. If you have the code review ARN, you can call https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_ListRecommendations.html. This returns the list of all recommendations for a completed code review. You can then use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_PutRecommendationFeedback.html to store reactions and send feedback as UTF-8 text code for emojis. 
To view the feedback that you have submitted, call https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_DescribeRecommendationFeedback.html using the RecommendationId. To view feedback from all users, call https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_ListRecommendationFeedback.html by using a filter on RecommendationIds and UserIds. For more information, see the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer API Reference.
