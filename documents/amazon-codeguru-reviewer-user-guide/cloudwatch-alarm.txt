Monitoring CodeGuru Reviewer recommendations with CloudWatch alarms
You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for your CodeGuru Reviewer recommendations to monitor their count over time. 
An alarm watches the number of recommendations for one of three CodeGuru Reviewer CloudWatch dimensions that you specify: 
  ProviderType — View the number of recommendations for a provider type. You can view the count of recommendations in all repositories in AWS CodeCommit, your Bitbucket account, your GitHub account, or your GitHub Enterprise Server account, over a period of time. 
  CodeReviewType — View the number of recommendations a code review types. The one available code review type is PullRequest. Use it to view the count of recommendations in one pull request. 
  RepositoryName — View the count of recommendations for one repository over a period of time. 
You set one or more actions that happen when the number of recommendations for a dimension exceeds a count over a number of time periods you choose. For example, you can specify that an Amazon SNS notification is sent when more than 25 recommendations are generated for a branch in a repository within an hour. 
A user or role must have CloudWatch PutMetricAlarm permissions to create an alarm. For more information, see Using identity-based policies for CodeGuru Reviewer and Amazon CloudWatch permissions reference in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
