Deploying to Amazon EC2 Container Service
Amazon Elastic Container Service is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
To deploy applications on Amazon Elastic Container Service, your application components must be developed to run in a Docker container. A Docker container is a standardized unit of software development, containing everything that your software application needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, etc.
The Toolkit for Visual Studio provides a wizard that simplifies publishing applications through Amazon ECS. This wizard is described in the following sections.
For more information about Amazon ECS, go to the Elastic Container Service documentation. It includes an overview of Docker basics and creating a cluster.
