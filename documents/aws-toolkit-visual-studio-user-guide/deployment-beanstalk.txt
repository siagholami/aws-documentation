Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that simplifies the process of provisioning AWS resources for your application. Elastic Beanstalk provides all of the AWS infrastructure required to deploy your application. This infrastructure includes:
 Amazon EC2 instances that host the executables and content for your application.
 An Auto Scaling group to maintain the appropriate number of Amazon EC2 instances to support your application.
 An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer that routes incoming traffic to the Amazon EC2 instance with the most bandwidth.
The Toolkit for Visual Studio provides a wizard that simplifies publishing applications through Elastic Beanstalk. This wizard is described in the following sections.
