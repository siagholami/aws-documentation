Quotas for your Network Load Balancers
Your AWS account has default quotas, formerly referred to as limits, for each AWS service. Unless otherwise noted, each quota is Region-specific. You can request increases for some quotas, and other quotas cannot be increased.
To view the quotas for your Network Load Balancers, open the Service Quotas console. In the navigation pane, choose AWS services and select Elastic Load Balancing. You can also use the describe-account-limits (AWS CLI) command for Elastic Load Balancing.
To request a quota increase, see Requesting a quota increase in the Service Quotas User Guide. If the quota is not yet available in Service Quotas, use the Elastic Load Balancing limit increase form.
