Update a TLS listener for your Network Load Balancer
After you create a TLS listener, you can replace the default certificate, add or remove certificates from the certificate list, update the security policy, or update the ALPN policy.
Limitation
You cannot install certificates with RSA keys larger than 2048-bit or EC keys on your Network Load Balancer.

Replace the default certificate
You can replace the default certificate for your TLS listener using the following procedure. For more information, see Default certificate.
To replace the default certificate using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


Select the check box for the listener and choose Edit.


For Default SSL certificate, do one of the following:
    If you created or imported a certificate using AWS Certificate Manager, choose From ACM and choose the certificate.
    If you uploaded a certificate using IAM, choose From IAM and choose the certificate.


Choose Update.


To replace the default certificate using the AWS CLI
Use the modify-listener command with the --certificates option.
Add certificates to the certificate list
You can add certificates to the certificate list for your listener using the following procedure. When you first create a TLS listener, the certificate list is empty. You can add one or more certificates. You can optionally add the default certificate to ensure that this certificate is used with the SNI protocol even if it is replaced as the default certificate. For more information, see Certificate list.
To add certificates to the certificate list using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


For the HTTPS listener to update, choose View/edit certificates, which displays the default certificate followed by any other certificates that you've added to the listener.


Choose the Add certificates icon (the plus sign) in the menu bar, which displays the default certificate followed by any other certificates managed by ACM and IAM. If you've already added a certificate to the listener, its check box is selected and disabled.


To add certificates that are already managed by ACM or IAM, select the check boxes for the certificates and choose Add.


If you have a certificate that isn't managed by ACM or IAM, import it to ACM and add it to your listener as follows:


Choose Import certificate.


For Certificate private key, paste the PEM-encoded, unencrypted private key for the certificate.


For Certificate body, paste the PEM-encoded certificate.


(Optional) For Certificate chain, paste the PEM-encoded certificate chain.


Choose Import. The newly imported certificate appears in the list of available certificates and is selected.


Choose Add.


To leave this screen, choose the Back to the load balancer icon (the back button) in the menu bar.


To add a certificate to the certificate list using the AWS CLI
Use the add-listener-certificates command.
Remove certificates from the certificate list
You can remove certificates from the certificate list for a TLS listener using the following procedure. To remove the default certificate for a TLS listener, see Replace the default certificate.
To remove certificates from the certificate list using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


For the listener to update, choose View/edit certificates, which displays the default certificate followed by any other certificates that you've added to the listener.


Choose the Remove certificates icon (the minus sign) in the menu bar.


Select the check boxes for the certificates and choose Remove.


To leave this screen, choose the Back to the load balancer icon (the back button) in the menu bar.


To remove a certificate from the certificate list using the AWS CLI
Use the remove-listener-certificates command.
Update the security policy
When you create a TLS listener, you can select the security policy that meets your needs. When a new security policy is added, you can update your TLS listener to use the new security policy. Network Load Balancers do not support custom security policies. For more information, see Security policies.
To update the security policy using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


Select the check box for the TLS listener and choose Edit.


For Security policy, choose a security policy.


Choose Update.


To update the security policy using the AWS CLI
Use the modify-listener command with the --ssl-policy option.
Update the ALPN policy
You can update the ALPN policy for your TLS listener using the following procedure. For more information, see ALPN policies.
To update the ALPN policy using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


Select the check box for the TLS listener and choose Edit.


For ALPN policy, choose a policy to enable ALPN or choose None to disable ALPN.
