View Video Streams on Your AWS DeepLens Device
In addition to viewing your AWS DeepLens output streams in a browser, you can use mplayer to view the streams directly from your AWS DeepLens device after connecting it to a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse. This is especially useful when your AWS DeepLens device is not online.
Instead of connecting to the device directly using a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse, you can also use ssh to connect to the device, if SSH access is enabled on the device when it is registered. You can then use mplayer on your work computer to view the streams. Make sure that mplayer is installed on your computer before viewing the output streams from your AWS DeepLens device. For more information about the installation, see mplayer download.
