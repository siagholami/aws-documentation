View Video Streams from AWS DeepLens Device in Browser
Note
 To view a project's output in a supported browser, your device must have the awscam software version 1.3.9 or higher installed. For information to update the device software, see Update Your AWS DeepLens Device. 
Note
To view a project's output in Chrome on Mac El Capitan or earlier, you must provide a password to load the streaming certificate for viewing the project output. If you have such an old Mac operating system and want to use Chrome, skip the procedure below and follow the instructions in How to View Project Output in the Chrome Browser on Mac El Capitan or Earlier? to set up your browser to view the project output.
To view project output from your AWS DeepLens device in a supported web browser


If you have not already downloaded the streaming certificate when registering your device or if you have lost the downloaded copy, do one of the following to download the streaming certificate. The steps are different depending on whether you use the device setup application or not.


Download the streaming certificate without using the device setup page:


Establish an SSH connection to your AWS DeepLens device from your computer:
ssh aws_cam@device_local_ip_address
An example of device_local_ip_address would be 192.168.0.47. After entering the correct device password, which you specified during the device registration, you're now logged in to the device. 


Make a local copy (my_streaming_cert.pfx) of the streaming certificate (client.pfx) on the device:
sudo cp /opt/awscam/awsmedia/certs/client.pfx /home/aws_cam/my_streaming_cert.pfx
When prompted, enter the device password to complete the above commands. 
Make sure that the owner of the device-local copy is aws_cam. 
sudo chown aws_cam /home/aws_cam/my_streaming_cert.pfx
After this, log out of the device:
exit


Transfer the copy of the streaming certificate from the device to your computer:
scp aws_cam@device_local_ip_address:/home/aws_cam/my_streaming_cert.pfx ~/Downloads/
The example used the Downloads folder under the user's home directory (~/) to transfer the certificate to. You can choose any other writeable directory as the destination folder.




Follow the following steps to download the streaming certificate for the AWS DeepLens device:


Return your device to its setup mode, if necessary, and connect your computer to the device's ADMC-NNNN Wi-Fi network.


Start the device setup app at http://deeplens.config. 


Follow the on-screen instructions to download the streaming certificate for viewing a project's output streams.




Import into your supported web browser the streaming certificate you downloaded during the device registration.


For FireFox (Windows and macOS Sierra or higher), follow these steps:


Choose Preferences in FireFox. 


Choose Privacy & Security.


Choose View certificate.


Choose the Your Certificates tab.


Choose Import.


Choose the downloaded streaming certificate to load into FireFox.


When prompted to enter your computer's system password, if your AWS DeepLens software version is 1.3.23 or higher, type DeepLens in the password input field. If your AWS DeepLens software version is 1.3.22 or lower, leave the password field blank and follow the on-screen instruction to finish importing the streaming certificate.
Note

Choose View Certificates.
On Certificate Manager, choose the Your certificates tab.
Choose Import.
Navigate to and open the downloaded streaming certificate. 
When prompted for a password, if your AWS DeepLens software version is 1.3.23 or higher, type DeepLens in the password input field. If your AWS DeepLens software version is 1.3.22 or lower, choose OK without entering one.




For Chrome (macOS Sierra or higher), follow these steps:


On your macOS, double-click the downloaded streaming certificate to add it to System under Keychains and My Certificate under Category.

In your Chrome browser, open Settings and choose Advanced settings.


In Privacy and security, choose Manage certificates. 


Choose Import.


Navigate to the folder containing the downloaded streaming certificate and choose it to load into Chrome.


When prompted for your computer's system password, if your AWS DeepLens software version is 1.3.23 or higher, type DeepLens in the password input field. If your AWS DeepLens software version is 1.3.22 or lower, leave the password field blank and follow the on-screen instructions to finish importing the streaming certificate.
