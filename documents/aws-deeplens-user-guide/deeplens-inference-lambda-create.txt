Create and Publish an AWS DeepLens Inference Lambda Function
This topic explains how to add an AWS Lambda inference function to your custom AWS DeepLens project. The Lambda function helps you make an inference from frames in a video stream that is captured by your AWS DeepLens device.  If an existing and published Lambda function meets your application requirements, you can use it instead. 
The AWS DeepLens device is an AWS IoT Greengrass core device. The inference function is executed on the AWS DeepLens device in a Lambda runtime as part of the AWS IoT Greengrass core software. This software is included in the AWS DeepLens software package  installed on your AWS DeepLens device. When you create the AWS DeepLens inference function, it's an AWS Lambda function. 
To have all the essential AWS IoT Greengrass dependencies included automatically, use AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK in the Lambda function. 
The AWS DeepLens inference engine is the awscam module of the AWS DeepLens device library. Models that are trained in a supported framework must be optimized to run on your AWS DeepLens device. Unless your model is already optimized, use the model optimization module (mo) of the device library. This converts framework-specific model artifacts to AWS DeepLens-compliant model artifacts. 
In this topic, you learn how to create an inference Lambda function that performs three key functions: Preprocessing, inference, and post processing. For the complete function code, see The Complete Inference Lambda Function.
To create and publish an inference Lambda function for your AWS DeepLens project

Download the AWS DeepLens inference function template to your computer. Don't unzip the downloaded file.

The zip file contains a basic inference function in Python (deeplens_inference.py) and a folder (greengrasssdk) containing the AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK for AWS DeepLens.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.


Choose Create function, then choose Author from Scratch.


In the Basic information section:


Under Function name, type a name for your Lambda function, for example, deeplens-cat-or-dog-inferer. 
The function name must start with deeplens.


Under Runtime, choose Python 2.7.


Under Permissions, expand Choose or create an execution role, if it's not already expanded.


Under Execution role, choose Use an existing role.


From the Existing role dropdown list, choose service-role/AWSDeepLensLambdaRole, which was created when you registered your device.


Scroll to the bottom of the page and choose Create function.


In the Function code section, do the following: 


Under Code entry type, choose Upload a .zip file. 


Under Runtime, choose Python 2.7.


Under Handler, replace the value by deeplens_inference.lambda_handler.
Note
In the downloaded AWS DeepLens inference function template, the Lambda function file name is deeplens_inference.py and the Lambda function handler name is lambda_handler. The Handler value must match the Lambda function name and the Lambda function handler name, separated by a period. If you change the function name and the handler name, you must update this Handler value to match the changes.


Under Function package, choose Upload and then choose the downloaded deeplens_inference_function_template.zip file to open.
If you've modified the zip file name, choose that file instead.


Choose Save (on the upper-right corner of the Lambda console) to load the basic Lambda function into the code editor.


If the Handler value doesn't match the function name or the Lambda handler name, the inference function code might not load. In this case, choose the function from the code navigation pane, delete the empty code tab, update the Handler value, and then choose Save.

In the code editor, review the existing code of the template. The first part is to import dependent modules:

from threading import Thread, Event
   import os
   import json
   import numpy as np
   import awscam
   import cv2
   import greengrasssdk
Let's examine this block line by line. 
    The os module allows your Lambda function to access the AWS DeepLens device operating system.
    The json module lets your Lambda function work with JSON data.
    The awscam module allows your Lambda function to use the AWS DeepLens device library. For more information, see Model Object.
    The mo module allows your Lambda function to access the AWS DeepLens model optimizer. For more information, see Model Optimization (mo) Module.
    The cv2 module lets your Lambda function access the Open CV library used for image preprocessing, including local display of frames from video feeds originating from the device.
    The greengrasssdk module exposes the AWS IoT Greengrass API for the Lambda function to send messages to the AWS Cloud, including sending operational status and inference results to AWS IoT.
    The threading module allows your Lambda function to access Python's multi-threading library.
The other part is to define a Lambda handler. The Handler value must match the function name and this handler name.
def lambda_handler(event, context):
                   return
For inference running on the AWS DeepLens device, the Lambda handler must be empty.


Next, add project-specific logic in the code editor.
Note
As an illustration, the steps walk you through how to customize your AWS DeepLens inference function for cat and dog recognition.
If you're already familiar with the steps below, you can skip them and copy the complete cat and dog inference function example and paste it into the code editor to replace whatever shown there.


Append the following Python code as a helper class for local display of the inference results:
```
  class LocalDisplay(Thread):
      """ Class for facilitating the local display of inference results
          (as images). The class is designed to run on its own thread. In
          particular the class dumps the inference results into a FIFO

          results can be rendered using mplayer by typing:

          RESOLUTION = {'1080p' : (1920, 1080), '720p' : (1280, 720), '480p' : (858, 480)}

The helper class (LocalDisplay) is a subclass of https://docs.python.org/2.0/lib/thread-objects.html. It encapsulates the process to stream processed video frames for local display on the device or using a web browser: 


Exposes a constructor (__init__(self, resolution)) to initiate the LocalDisplay class with the specified image size (resolution).


Overrides the run method, which is invoked by the Thread.start method, to support continuous writing images to the specified file (result_path) on the device. The Lambda function can write to files only in the /tmp directory. To view the images in this file (/tmp/results.mjpeg), start mplayer on a device terminal window as follows:
mplayer -demuxer lavf -lavfdopts format=mjpeg:probesize=32 /tmp/results.mjpeg


Exposes the set_frame_data method for the main inference function to call to update image data by encoding a project stream frame to JPG (set_frame_data). The example code can be modified to support other encodings. 


Exposes the join method to turn waiting threads active by setting the https://docs.python.org/2.0/lib/event-objects.html object's internal flag to true.




Append to the code editor the following Python code, which initializes looping through the inference logic, frame by frame:
```
  def infinite_infer_run():
      """ Run the DeepLens inference loop frame by frame"""
      try:
          # This cat-dog model is implemented as binary classifier, since the number
          # of labels is small, create a dictionary that converts the machine
          # labels to human readable labels.
          model_type = 'classification'
          output_map = {0: 'dog', 1: 'cat'}
      # Create an IoT client for sending to messages to the cloud.
      client = greengrasssdk.client('iot-data')
      iot_topic = '$aws/things/{}/infer'.format(os.environ['AWS_IOT_THING_NAME'])

      # Create a local display instance that will dump the image bytes to a FIFO
      # file that the image can be rendered locally.
      local_display = LocalDisplay('480p')
      local_display.start()

      # The sample projects come with optimized artifacts, hence only the artifact
      # path is required.
      model_path = '/opt/awscam/artifacts/mxnet_resnet18-catsvsdogs_FP32_FUSED.xml'

      # Load the model onto the GPU.
      client.publish(topic=iot_topic, payload='Loading action cat-dog model')
      model = awscam.Model(model_path, {'GPU': 1})
      client.publish(topic=iot_topic, payload='Cat-Dog model loaded')

      # Since this is a binary classifier only retrieve 2 classes.
      num_top_k = 2

      # The height and width of the training set images
      input_height = 224
      input_width = 224

      # Do inference until the lambda is killed.
      while True:
          # inference loop to add. See the next step 
          ...

  except Exception as ex:
      client.publish(topic=iot_topic, payload='Error in cat-dog lambda: {}'.format(ex))

```
The inference initialization proceeds as follows: 


Specifies the model type (model_type), model artifact path (model_path) to load the model artifact (awscam.Model), specifying whether the model is loaded into the device's GPU ({'GPU':1}) or CPU ({'CPU':0}). We don't recommend using the CPU because it is much less efficient. The model artifacts are deployed to the device in the /opt/awscam/artifacts directory. For the artifact optimized for AWS DeepLens, it consists of an .xml file located in this directory. For the artifact not yet optimized for AWS DeepLens, it consists of a JSON file and another file with the .params extension located in the same directory. For optimized model artifact file path, set the model_path variable to a string literal: 
model_path = "/opt/awscam/artifacts/<model-name>.xml"
In this example, <model-name> is mxnet_resnet18-catsvsdogs_FP32_FUSED. 
For unoptimized model artifacts, use the mo.optimize function to optimized the artifacts and to obtain the model_path value of a given model name (<model_name>):
error, model_path = mo.optimize(<model_name>, input_width, input_height)
Here, the model_name value should be the one you specified when importing the model. You can also determine the model name by inspecting the S3 bucket for the model artifacts or the local directory of /opt/awscam/artifacts on your device. For example, unoptimized model artifacts output by MXNet consists of a <model-name>-symbol.json file and a <model-name>-0000.params file. If a model artifact consists of the following two files: hotdog_or_not_model-symbol.json and hotdog_or_not_model-0000.params, you specify hotdog_or_not_model as the input <model_name> value when calling mo.optimize.


Specifies input_width and input_height as the width and height in pixels of images used in training. To ensure meaningful inference, you must convert input image for inference to the same size. 


Specifies as part of initialization the model type (model_type) and declares the output map (output_map). In this example, the model type is classification. Other model types are ssd (single shot detector) and segmentation. The output map is used to map an inference result label from a numerical value to a human readable text. For binary classifications, there are only two labels (0 and 1). 
The num_top_k variable refers to the number of inference results of the highest probability. The value can range from 1 to the maximum number of classifiers. For binary classification, it can be 1 or 2.


Instantiates an AWS IoT Greengrass SDK (greengrasssdk) to make the inference output available to the AWS Cloud. This includes sending process info and processed results to an AWS IoT topic (iot_topic)The topic provides another means to view your AWS DeepLens project output, although as JSON data, instead of a video stream.


Starts a thread (local_display.start) to feed parsed video frames for local display (LocalDisplay), on device or using a web browser.




Replace the inference loop placeholder (...) above with the following code segment:
# Get a frame from the video stream
              ret, frame = awscam.getLastFrame()
              if not ret:
                  raise Exception('Failed to get frame from the stream')
              # Resize frame to the same size as the training set.
              frame_resize = cv2.resize(frame, (input_height, input_width))
              # Run the images through the inference engine and parse the results using
              # the parser API, note it is possible to get the output of doInference
              # and do the parsing manually, but since it is a classification model,
              # a simple API is provided.
              parsed_inference_results = model.parseResult(model_type,
                                                           model.doInference(frame_resize))
              # Get top k results with highest probabilities
              top_k = parsed_inference_results[model_type][0:num_top_k]
              # Add the label of the top result to the frame used by local display.
              # See https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/d6/d6e/group__imgproc__draw.html
              # for more information about the cv2.putText method.
              # Method signature: image, text, origin, font face, font scale, color, and thickness
              cv2.putText(frame, output_map[top_k[0]['label']], (10, 70),
                          cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 3, (255, 165, 20), 8)
              # Set the next frame in the local display stream.
              local_display.set_frame_data(frame)
              # Send the top k results to the IoT console via MQTT
              cloud_output = {}
              for obj in top_k:
                  cloud_output[output_map[obj['label']]] = obj['prob']
              client.publish(topic=iot_topic, payload=json.dumps(cloud_output))
The frame-by-frame inference logic flows as follows: 


Captures a frame from the AWS DeepLens device video feed (awscam.getLastFrame()). 


Processes the captured input frame (cv2.resize(frame, (input_height, input_width))) to ensure that its dimensions match the dimensions of the frame that the model was trained on. Depending on the model training, you might want to perform other preprocessing steps, such as image normalization.


Performs inference on the frame based on the specified model: result = model.doInference(frame_resize).


Parses the inference result: model.parseResult(model_type, result).


Sends the frame to the local display stream: local_display.set_frame_data. If you want to show the human-readable label of the most likely category in the local display, add the label to the captured frame: cv2.putText. If not, ignore the last step. 


Sends the inferred result to IoT: client.publish.




Choose Save to save the code you entered.


From the Actions dropdown menu list, choose Publish new version. Publishing the function makes it available in the AWS DeepLens console so that you can add it to your custom project.

The Complete Inference Lambda Function
The following code shows a complete Lambda function. When deployed to the AWS DeepLens device, the function infers video frames captured from the device to be a cat or dog. The function is based on the model serialized in the model file mxnet_resnet18-catsvsdogs_FP32_FUSED.xml under the /opt/awscam/artifacts/ directory.
