Create and Deploy an AWS DeepLens Project
An AWS DeepLens project consists of a deep learning model and a Lambda function that makes inferences of an input image based on the deep learning model. 
For the testing purpose, you can deploy to your registered device a sample project with a pre-trained deep learning model and a tested inference Lambda function created by AWS DeepLens. For more information, see Building AWS DeepLens Projects.
To use a sample project, follow the instructions given in Create and Deploy an AWS DeepLens Sample Project in the AWS DeepLens Console.
