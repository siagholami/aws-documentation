To restore your AWS DeepLens device to its factory settings


Insert the prepared USB drive into your AWS DeepLens device and power it on. Repeatedly press the ESC key to enter BIOS. To prepare a USB drive, see Preparing for the Factory Reset of Your AWS DeepLens Device.


From the BIOS window on your monitor, choose Boot From File, choose USB VOLUME, choose EFI, choose BOOT, and then choose BOOTx64.EFI.


After the live system is up, wait for the device reset to start automatically. This occurs when the power LED indicator starts to flash and a terminal window pops up to display your progress. No further user input is necessary at this point. 
Note
If an error occurs and the recovery fails, restart the procedure from step 1. For detailed error messages, see the result.log file that's generated on the USB flash drive.
The LED indicator light won't flash if you are using the card slot on the back of the device.


After approximately six minutes, the power LED light stops flashing and the terminal closes, which indicates that the factory reset is complete. Then, the device reboots itself automatically. 


Your device is now restored. You can disconnect your USB flash drive from AWS DeepLens.
