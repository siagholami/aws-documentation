Step 5: Create a Peer Node in Your Membership
Now that you are enrolled as an administrator for your member, you can use your client to create a peer node. Your member's peer nodes interact with other members' peer nodes on the blockchain to query and update the ledger, and store a local copy of the ledger.
Wait a minute or two for the administrative permissions from previous steps to propagate, and then use one of the following procedures to create a peer node.
To create a peer node using the AWS Management Console


Open the Managed Blockchain console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/managedblockchain/.


Choose Networks, select the network from the list, and then choose View details.


Select a Member from the list, and then choose Create peer node.


Choose configuration parameters for your peer node according to the previous guidelines, and then choose Create peer node.


To create a peer node using the AWS CLI

Use the create-node command, as shown in the following example. Replace the value of --network-id, --member-id, and AvailabilityZone as appropriate.

[ec2-user@ip-192-0-2-17 ~]$ aws managedblockchain create-node \
  --node-configuration '{"InstanceType":"bc.t3.small","AvailabilityZone":"us-east-1a"}' \
  --network-id n-MWY63ZJZU5HGNCMBQER7IN6OIU \
  --member-id m-K46ICRRXJRCGRNNS4ES4XUUS5A
The command returns output that includes the peer node's NodeID, as shown in the following example:
{
       "NodeId": "nd-6EAJ5VA43JGGNPXOUZP7Y47E4Y"
  }
