# Accept an Invitation to Create a Member and Join a Managed Blockchain Network<a name="managed-blockchain-hyperledger-member"></a>

In Amazon Managed Blockchain, a member is a distinct identity within the Managed Blockchain network associated with an AWS account\. An AWS account can have multiple members on the network\. Every member in a Managed Blockchain network must be invited to participate through a proposal made by an existing member and approved according to the network's voting policy\. The exception is the first member, which is created along with the network\. For more information, see [Work with Proposals](managed-blockchain-proposals.md)\. After the invitation is approved, the invited AWS account can create a member and join the network using the invitation ID\.

Each member pays an hourly rate, billed per second, for their network membership, peer nodes, and peer node storage\. Charges also apply to the amount of data written to the network\. Charges may vary depending on the network edition selected when the network was created\. For more information, see [Amazon Managed Blockchain Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/pricing/)\. The resources associated with a member's account depend on the specific blockchain framework and application requirements, but each member must have the following resources:
+ **An interface VPC endpoint in the account**–Managed Blockchain is a PrivateLink\-powered service, so you must have an interface VPC endpoint in your account to communicate with the service endpoint that the Managed Blockchain network makes available\. For more information, see [Create an Interface VPC Endpoint to Connect to Managed Blockchain Network Resources](managed-blockchain-endpoints.md) and [Key Concepts: Managed Blockchain Networks, Members, and Peer Nodes](network-components.md)\.
+ **One or more peer nodes**–Each member must have at least one peer node to actively participate in the blockchain network\. When you create a member it has no peer nodes by default\. You create peer nodes after you create the member\. Peer nodes run on Managed Blockchain instances\. Custom Amazon EC2 instances or on\-premises instances cannot participate as peer nodes on a Managed Blockchain network\. For more information, see [Work with Peer Nodes in a Managed Blockchain Network](managed-blockchain-hyperledger-peer-nodes.md)\.
