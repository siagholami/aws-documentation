The Amazon WorkSpaces Android client application requires the following:
 Amazon Kindle Fire tablets released after 2012 with Fire OS 4.0 and later.
 Android tablets and phones with Android OS 4.4 and later. The client application works on most devices with Android version 4.4 or later, but some devices might not be compatible. If you have problems with a device, you can report the problem on the Amazon WorkSpaces forum.
Note
Versions of the Android client application after 2.4.15 require devices with Android OS 9 and later.
 Chromebooks that support installing Android applications. Chromebooks launched in 2019 or later support installing Android applications. However, some Chromebooks launched before 2019 might not support installing Android applications.
We recommend using the Android client application if your Chromebook supports it. To determine whether your Chromebook is compatible with the Amazon WorkSpaces Android client application or whether it requires the Amazon WorkSpaces Chromebook client application, see the installation steps for Chromebooks launched before 2019.

On your Chromebook, open https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/ and choose Android/Chromebook.

Determine whether your Chromebook meets the requirements of the Amazon WorkSpaces Chromebook client application:

The Amazon WorkSpaces Chromebook client application requires a Chromebook with Chrome OS version 45 or later. The client application works on most Chromebooks with version 45 or later, but some devices might not be compatible. If you have problems with a device, you can report the problem on the Amazon WorkSpaces forum.
To check the version of Chrome OS on your Chromebook, go to the status area, where your account picture appears. Choose Settings, About Chrome OS.



If your Chromebook is running Chrome OS version 45 or later, open the link to the  Amazon WorkSpaces Chromebook client application on the Chrome Web Store.

Connecting to Your WorkSpace
To connect to your WorkSpace, complete the following procedure.
To connect to your WorkSpace


On your device, open the Amazon WorkSpaces client application.


The first time that you run the client application, you are prompted for your registration code, which is contained in your welcome email. The Amazon WorkSpaces client application uses the registration code and user name to identify which WorkSpace to connect to. When you launch the client application later, the same registration code is used. You can enter a different registration code by launching the client application and tapping Enter new registration code on the login screen.


Enter your user name and password and tap Sign In. If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has enabled multi-factor authentication for your organization's WorkSpaces, you are prompted for a passcode to complete your login. Your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator will provide more information about how to obtain your passcode.


If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has not disabled the "Remember Me" feature, you are prompted to save your credentials securely so that you can connect to your WorkSpace easily in the future. Your credentials will be securely cached up to the maximum lifetime of your Kerberos ticket.


After the client application connects to your WorkSpace, your WorkSpace desktop is displayed.
