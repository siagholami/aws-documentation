Requirements
The 3.0 versions of the client application require macOS 10.12 or later.
The 1.0 or 2.0 versions of the client application require OS X 10.8.1 or later.
Important
If you use macOS 10.15 (Catalina), you must use version 2.5.11 or later of the macOS client application. Earlier versions of the client application have issues with keyboard input on Catalina.
If you are using Catalina and are working with Linux WorkSpaces, we recommend using version 3.0.2 or later of the macOS client to avoid potential keyboard issues with some applications.
Setup and Installation
Depending on which version of the client you want, do one of the following:

If you're having trouble updating your Amazon WorkSpaces macOS client application to a newer version, use the following procedure to update your client application.
To update the WorkSpaces macOS client application to a newer version


In the Finder, open your Applications folder, then open Utilities, and choose Terminal.


In the Terminal window, enter the following command, and then press the Return key.


defaults delete com.amazon.workspaces SUSkippedVersion


In the Terminal app, choose Terminal, Quit Terminal.


If you have not already entered a registration code in the WorkSpaces macOS client application, do so, and then choose Amazon WorkSpaces, Quit Amazon WorkSpaces to close the client application.

Determining Your Client Version
To see which version of the WorkSpaces client you have, choose Amazon WorkSpaces, About Amazon WorkSpaces, or click the gear icon in the upper-right corner and choose About Amazon WorkSpaces.
Connecting to Your WorkSpace
To connect to your WorkSpace, complete the following procedure.
To connect to your WorkSpace for 3.0 clients


The first time that you run the client application, you are prompted for your registration code, which is contained in your welcome email. The Amazon WorkSpaces client application uses the registration code and user name to identify which WorkSpace to connect to. When you launch the client application later, the same registration code is used. To enter a different registration code, launch the client application, and then on the menu bar, choose Settings, Manage Login Information.


Enter your user name and password in the login screen and choose Sign In. If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has enabled multi-factor authentication for your organization's WorkSpaces, you are prompted for a passcode to complete your login. Your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator will provide more information about how to obtain your passcode.


If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has not disabled the Keep me logged in feature, you can select the Keep me logged in check box at the bottom of the login screen to save your credentials securely so that you can connect to your WorkSpace easily while the client application remains running. Your credentials are securely cached up to the maximum lifetime of your Kerberos ticket.


After the client application connects to your WorkSpace, your WorkSpace desktop is displayed.

The first time that you run the client application, you are prompted for your registration code, which is contained in your welcome email. The Amazon WorkSpaces client application uses the registration code and user name to identify which WorkSpace to connect to. When you launch the client application later, the same registration code is used. To enter a different registration code, launch the client application, and then on the menu bar, choose Options, Manage Registrations.


Enter your user name and password in the login screen and choose Sign In. If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has enabled multi-factor authentication for your organization's WorkSpaces, you are prompted for a passcode to complete your login. Your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator will provide more information about how to obtain your passcode.


If your Amazon WorkSpaces administrator has not disabled the "Remember Me" feature, you are prompted to save your credentials securely so that you can connect to your WorkSpace easily while the client application remains running. Your credentials are securely cached up to the maximum lifetime of your Kerberos ticket.


After the client application connects to your WorkSpace, your WorkSpace desktop is displayed.
An interruption of network connectivity causes an active session to be disconnected. This can be caused by events such as closing the laptop lid, or the loss of your wireless network connection. The Amazon WorkSpaces client application for macOS attempts to reconnect the session automatically if network connectivity is regained within a certain amount of time. The default session resume timeout is 20 minutes, but this timeout can be modified by your network administrator.
Managing Your Login Information (3.0 Clients Only)
You can view your registration code and what Region your WorkSpace is in. You can specify whether you want the WorkSpaces client application to save your current registration code, and you can assign a name to your WorkSpace. You can also specify if you want Amazon WorkSpaces to keep you logged in to a WorkSpace until you quit or your login period expires.
To manage your login information for a WorkSpace


In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, go to Settings, Manage Login Information.


In the Manage Login Information dialog box, you can see the registration code and Region information for your WorkSpace.


(Optional) If you want the WorkSpaces client to remember your current registration code, select the Remember Registration Code check box.


Under Saved registration codes, select the WorkSpace you want to name.


In the WorkSpace name box, enter a name for the WorkSpace.


(Optional) If you want WorkSpaces to keep you logged in until you quit or your login period expires, select the Keep me logged in check box.


Choose Save.


Client Views
You can switch to full screen mode by choosing View, Enter Full Screen (3.0 clients) or View, Show Fullscreen (1.0 and 2.0 clients) in the client application menu.
While in full screen mode, you can switch back to window mode by moving the pointer to the top of the screen. The client application menu is displayed, and you can choose View, Leave Full Screen (3.0 clients) or View, Exit Fullscreen (1.0 and 2.0 clients) in the client application menu.
You can also toggle full screen mode by pressing ControlOptionReturn.
Client Language
You can select the language displayed by the client by performing the following steps.
Note
The WorkSpaces client applications support Japanese. However, Japanese WorkSpaces are available only in the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region.
To select the client language


Depending on which client you're using, do one of the following.  
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Enter your desired language in the Select a language list and choose Save.


Restart the client.


Display Support
Amazon WorkSpaces Value, Standard, Performance, Power, PowerPro, and GraphicsPro bundles support a maximum of four displays and a maximum resolution of 3840x2160 (ultra-high definition, or UHD). The maximum supported resolution depends on the number of displays, as shown in the following table.



Displays
Resolution




2
3840x2160


4
1920x1200



Note
Graphics bundles support only a single monitor configuration with a maximum resolution of 2560x1600.
The Amazon WorkSpaces client application extracts the Extended Display Information Data (EDID) of all attached displays and determines the best compatibility match before starting the session. If you have a high pixel density (high DPI) display, the client application automatically scales the streaming window according to your local DPI settings. For better maximum resolution with high DPI displays, see WorkSpaces High DPI Display Support.
Note
If your screen resolution in WorkSpaces is low and objects look blurry, you need to turn on high DPI mode and adjust the display scaling settings on your Mac. For more information, see WorkSpaces High DPI Display Support.
To use multiple monitors with WorkSpaces


Configure your local machine to use multiple monitors. 


Start the WorkSpaces client application and log in to your WorkSpace.


Depending on which client you're using, do one of the following:  
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Your WorkSpace should now be extended across your displays. Whichever display you have designated as your primary display is also the primary display in WorkSpaces when you enter full screen mode.
Note
To use full screen mode on only some of the displays in a multiple monitor setup, press and hold the Option key and then click the green maximize button  in the top-left corner of the WorkSpaces window. This button expands the WorkSpaces client window to full size on a screen without extending the WorkSpace to the other displays. To return to the previous window size, press and hold the Option key and click the maximize button again.
Proxy Server
If your network requires you to use a proxy server to access the internet, you can enable the Amazon WorkSpaces client application to use a proxy for HTTPS (port 443) traffic. Proxy with authentication is not currently supported.
Note
The Amazon WorkSpaces client applications use the HTTPS port for updates, registration, and authentication. The desktop streaming connections to the WorkSpace require port 4172 to be enabled, and do not go through the proxy server. 
To use a proxy server for 3.0 clients


In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, go to Settings, Manage Proxy Server.


In the Set Proxy dialog box, select Use proxy server, enter the proxy server address and port, and choose Save.


To use a proxy server for 1.0 and 2.0 clients


In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, open the Advanced Settings dialog box.


In the Proxy Server Setting area, select Use Proxy Server, enter the proxy server address and port, and choose Save.


Command Shortcuts
The Amazon WorkSpaces macOS client supports the following command shortcuts:



If you're using...

Remapping the Windows Logo Key or the Command Key
By default, the Windows logo key on a Windows keyboard and the Command key on an Apple keyboard are both mapped to the Ctrl key when you're using the Amazon WorkSpaces macOS client application. If you want to change this behavior so that these two keys are mapped to the Windows logo key for use with Windows WorkSpaces, use the following procedure.
To map the Windows logo key or the Command key to the Windows logo key


If you haven't already done so, install or update to version 3.0.5 or later of the Amazon WorkSpaces macOS client application.


In the Finder, open your Applications folder, then open Utilities, and choose Terminal.


In the Terminal window, enter the following command, and then press the Return key.


defaults write "com.amazon.Amazon WorkSpaces Client" remap_cmd_to_ctrl 0


In the Terminal app, choose Terminal, Quit Terminal.


If your WorkSpaces macOS client application is running, choose Amazon WorkSpaces, Quit Amazon WorkSpaces in the client to close the client application.


Restart the WorkSpaces macOS client application and log in to your WorkSpace. The Windows logo key or the Command key should now be mapped to the Windows logo key.


Disconnect
To disconnect the macOS client application, you have several options: 
 In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, go to Amazon WorkSpaces, and then choose Disconnect WorkSpace. Your WorkSpace session ends, but the client application continues running in case you want to log in again.
 In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, go to Amazon WorkSpaces, and then choose Quit Amazon WorkSpaces. Your WorkSpace session ends, and the client application closes.
 In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, close the WorkSpaces client window by clicking the red close (X) button in the upper-left corner. In the End Session dialog box, choose Yes. Your WorkSpace session ends, but the client application continues running in case you want to log in again.
 You can also log off of the WorkSpace. In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, go to View, and then choose Send CtrlAltDelete. Choose Sign Out. Your WorkSpace session ends, but the client application continues running in case you want to log in again.
