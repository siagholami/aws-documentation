DeleteProgressUpdateStream
Deletes a progress update stream, including all of its tasks, which was previously created as an AWS resource used for access control. This API has the following traits:
 The only parameter needed for DeleteProgressUpdateStream is the stream name (same as a CreateProgressUpdateStream call).
 The call will return, and a background process will asynchronously delete the stream and all of its resources (tasks, associated resources, resource attributes, created artifacts).
 If the stream takes time to be deleted, it might still show up on a ListProgressUpdateStreams call.
  CreateProgressUpdateStream, ImportMigrationTask, NotifyMigrationTaskState, and all Associate[*] APIs related to the tasks belonging to the stream will throw "InvalidInputException" if the stream of the same name is in the process of being deleted.
 Once the stream and all of its resources are deleted, CreateProgressUpdateStream for a stream of the same name will succeed, and that stream will be an entirely new logical resource (without any resources associated with the old stream).
