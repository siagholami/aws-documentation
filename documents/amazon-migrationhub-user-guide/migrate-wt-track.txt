To track an application's migration status


Because you started your migration after you connected (authorized) your migration tool(s) and also grouped servers as applications in prior steps, your applications will already be present in Migration Hub's dashboard.


In the top pane labeled Most recently updated applications, click inside the donut chart labeled with the name of your migrating application. Doing this displays the application's detail screen.


If you do not see all of your application's servers listed in the application's details page, it could be because you have not grouped those servers into this application yet.  See Updates About My Migrations Don't Appear Inside an Application.


The first time a migration task is started for a server associated with the application, applications with this status will change to the in-progress status, automatically. After verifying the in-progress migration status from the application's detail screen, if the status is still Not started, you can manually change it to In-progress. Choose Change status in the upper, right-hand corner.


Select the radio button next to In-progress in the dialog box.


Choose Save. A green confirmation message appears at the top of the screen, and the status label changes to In-progress.


When the data in the application's detail screen indicates migration has completed, and you've performed testing and verification, change the status from "In-progress" to "Completed" by choosing Change status in the top right corner of the page.


Select the radio button next to Completed in the box.


Choose Save. A green confirmation message appears at the top of the screen, and the status label changes to Completed.
