4: Using Slices to Build the Maze
A slice is a special kind of asset (a .slice file) that is composed of a group of entities and their components. You can place, or instantiate, slices throughout your level quickly and easily. If you modify one slice instance, such as adding a component or changing a property, you can save your changes to update all the other slice instances.
You can also independently edit an individual slice instance and then not save the change. This results in a unique slice instance.
