Adding Open and Close Scripts
You need to add three Lua scripts to the trigger entity that you created. To do this, you add the Lua Script component three times and then select the script for each component.
The first script that you add (TriggerEvent.lua) tells the trigger area what events to execute when a player enters and exits the area.
The second and third scripts that you add (MoveObject.lua) define those events specified in the first script, and link them to a script that moves the door. The OpenExitDoor script moves the Z position of the door so that it disappears up into the structure. The CloseExitDoor script moves the Z position back to its original, closed position.
To add Lua scripts to your trigger entity


In the Entity Outliner, select the EntryDoor_Trigger entity.


In the Entity Inspector, click Add Component. Under Scripting, select Lua Script.


Repeat this two more times so that the EntryDoor_Trigger has a total of three Lua Script components.


In the first Lua Script component, next to the Script box, click Browse (...).

Navigate to StarterGame\Scripts\Triggers. Select TriggerEvent.lua. Click OK.

A list of options appears below the Properties heading in the Lua Script component.
For now, you'll configure the EventNameExit and EventName properties with names that you'll later define with the MoveObject.lua script. These can be any name you like; they just have to match the event names you configure in a later step.

Set the following options:
    EventName – Type OpenEntryDoor
    EventNameExit – Type CloseEntryDoor
    TriggerOnExit – Selected
    TriggerOnEnter – Selected
    TriggerOncePerEntity – Unselected

These settings configure the named events to be triggered upon entry and exit. 
The TriggerOncePerEntity, when selected, sets that trigger volume to trigger just once by that entity, in this case the player character. Some game events may require this based on design.


Next, you'll add the script that moves the door into its open position.

In the second Lua Script component, click Browse (...). Navigate to StarterGame\Scripts\General. Select MoveObject.lua. Click OK.

A list of options appears below the Properties heading in the Lua Script component.

As stated previously, the EventName can be any name you like, though it must match the EventName in the TriggerEvent.lua property.

Set the following options:
    EventName – Type OpenEntryDoor
    PositionOffset – Change Z to 3.00

When the OpenEntryDoor event is triggered, this script moves the Target, which you define as the door in the next tutorial. The target is moved to an open position, which is determined by the relative offset that is specified by the PositionOffset values.

In the third Lua Script component, add the same MoveObject.lua script as you did for the previous Lua Script component.


A list of options appears below the Properties heading in the Lua Script component.

Set the following options:
    EventName – Type CloseEntryDoor
    PositionOffset – Set X, Y, and Z to 0.00


This script moves the Target back to its original, closed position when the CloseEntryDoor event is triggered.
