Creating a Level
Lumberyard currently works with level files as its primary system for organizing gameplay content. Each level file contains the level file  along with support files that hold game data, scripts, terrain, and any additional references required for the level file to run in-game. 
You start by creating a new level within the Starter Game project, which you are already in if you have followed the tutorial up to this point.
When you create a level, Lumberyard creates a level file within the project directory. In this case, that is dev\StarterGame\Levels\<levelname>. Staying in the Starter Game project directory means that you have easy access to all the assets that are associated with the project. You'll use many of these assets throughout this tutorial series. Such assets include prebuilt 3D objects, scripts, textures, and much more.
To create a new level


You can create a new level in three ways. Use one of the following methods to create a new level:
    From the main menu: Choose File, New.
    With hot keys: Press CtrlN.
    From the Welcome window: Click New Level.


For Name, enter MyFirstLevel.


Level names can consist of alphanumeric characters. You cannot use spaces or special characters except hyphen [ - ] and underscore [ _ ].


Set Heightmap Resolution to 512x512. Click OK.



Select the 4096x4096 texture dimension. This value is in pixels. Click OK.



You have an empty level with a flat terrain mesh in your level file. You'll start with this empty file to build your game sample.
