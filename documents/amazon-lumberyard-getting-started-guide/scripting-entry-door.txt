Adding the Entry Door
In this tutorial, you'll create an entry door and add components that make it act solid and open upon approach.
To set up your entry door, you do the following:


Place the door entity.


Add the physics and collider components to the door.


Create a trigger volume.


Add scripts to the entry door entity to do the following:
    Trigger an event upon exit and another event upon entry.
    Change the position of an object and link it as the entry event.
    Change the position of an object and link it as the exit event.


Define the door as the target object for the Lua scripts.


Add realism by connecting sounds to the door's opening and closing events.
