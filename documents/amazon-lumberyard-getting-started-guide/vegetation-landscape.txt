Customizing Your Landscape (Optional)
If you prefer you can add several more vegetation categories. Use the tools and settings you learned to paint in the following landscape elements.
Flowers – Use a high density setting for scattered flowers, or a lower density setting for small pockets of flowers. Navigate to StarterGame\Objects\Natural\Vegetation. Use the following files:
 am_grass_flower_purple_group.cgf
 am_grass_flower_red_group.cgf
 am_grass_flower_white_group.cgf
Shrubbery – Place these in small pockets throughout to add detail to the scene. Navigate to StarterGame\Objects\Natural\Vegetation. Select am_bush_01_group.cgf.
TreeFar-Pine – Place these trees on the mountains and hillsides in the distance. Navigate to StarterGame\Objects\Natural\Vegetation. Select the following files:
