12: Exporting Your Game
Exporting an executable file for your game is a critical steps in game creation. 
You'll export your game and then play it as an executable file. Exporting your game packages up the data files so that you can run the level file as a standalone level.
To export and run your game

From the Lumberyard Editor main menu, choose Game, Export to Engine.

This creates a launcher file for your level. When the process is finished, a success message is displayed.


Open a file manager such as Windows Explorer to find your game launcher, StarterGameLauncher.exe. The launcher is saved in the same directory as the Lumberyard editor executable.

For example:
    For Visual Studio 2017, this might be C:\Amazon\Lumberyard\1.x.x.x\dev\Bin64vc141.
    For Visual Studio 2015, this might be C:\Amazon\Lumberyard\1.x.x.x\dev\Bin64vc140.


Run StarterGameLauncher.exe.

The game opens in a game window to the default level for the project.


Press the tilde ( \~ ) key on your keyboard to open the console for your game.

Enter map . For example, map MyFirstLevel. Press Enter.



Play and enjoy the game that you just created.

To quit, press ( ` ) again to open the console.
Enter quit.
Any changes that you make to your game in Lumberyard Editor require you to export your level again in order to see those changes when you use the game launcher.
