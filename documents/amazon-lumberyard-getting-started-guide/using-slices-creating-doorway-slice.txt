Creating a Doorway Slice
In previous tutorials, you grouped entities to make a doorway group. In this tutorial, you learn how to save that group as a new slice. 
To save the doorway group as a doorway slice


In the perspective viewport or the Entity Outliner, right-click the Doorway_parent entity and then choose Create slice. 



In the Save As dialog box, navigate to StarterGame\slices\GSG, enter a name such as MyMaze_doorway.slice, and then click Save.



Instantiate (place) the doorway slice: In the Asset Browser, navigate to StarterGame\Slices\GSG, and then select and drag the newly created MyMaze_doorway.slice into the viewport.



You should now have two doorways in your level, similar to the following image.


Press CtrlS to save your level.
