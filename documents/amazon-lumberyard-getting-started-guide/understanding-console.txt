7: Console

By default, only the Console's title bar is visible. To view the console, which is below the Perspective viewport, drag the upper edge of the Console title bar up to expand it. The console displays input and output data for Lumberyard Editor and any custom code that is written for your level. Advanced users can enter console commands into the gray bar on the bottom of the Console window.
For more information about the console, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/console-intro.html in the Amazon Lumberyard User Guide.
