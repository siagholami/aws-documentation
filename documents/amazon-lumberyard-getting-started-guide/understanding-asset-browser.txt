4: Asset Browser

The Asset Browser displays the file system for your project. You can find all assets that are in your project file system, such as 3D meshes, textures, and sound files. You can drag assets from the Asset Browser into the Entity Outliner or into the viewport.
For more information about the Asset Browser, see Asset Browser (Preview) in the Amazon Lumberyard User Guide.
