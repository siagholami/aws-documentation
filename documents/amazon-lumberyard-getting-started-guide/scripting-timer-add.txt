Adding a Timer
To add more challenge to the game experience, you'll add a timer that starts when the player enters the maze and stops upon exit. To do this, you'll set up a Lua script with supporting entity components that trigger when the player enters the maze and stops upon exiting. Timing how long it takes to complete a particular task is an element of gameplay that adds tension and excitement.
To set up your timer, you do the following:
 Create a parent entity (TimerParent) and add a child entity (TimerStart).
 To TimerStart, add and configure the following components:
   Box Shape
   Trigger Area
   UI Canvas Asset Ref
 To TimerStart, add and configure three Lua Script components.
 Adjust the position of the TimerStart entity so that it starts when the player crosses the maze threshold.
You complete a similar set of steps to set up the stop trigger, which stops the timer when your player exits the maze.
