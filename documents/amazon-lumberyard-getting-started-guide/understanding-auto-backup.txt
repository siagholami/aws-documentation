Configuring Auto Backup
Lumberyard's Auto Backup feature is off by default. Auto Backup saves your level file automatically at specified time intervals. This prevents the loss of your progress if an unexpected event causes a crash or freeze while you are working in your level. 
To enable this feature, in the main menu, choose Edit, Editor Settings, Global Preferences. Under General Settings, choose Files. In the right panel, you can customize your Auto Backup settings.
