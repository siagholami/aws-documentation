Placing a Global Environment Probe
When you place a global environment probe, the first thing you notice is that the shadows cast by objects look softer and contrast less with the environment. 
To place an environment probe


In the viewport near the center of the level, close to the maze, right-click and choose Create entity.


In the Entity Inspector, name the entity EnvironmentProbe.


In the Entity Inspector, click Add Component. Under Rendering, click Environment Probe.


In the environment probe's settings, modify the following values for the Area dimensions. Area dimensions control the size of the volume where lighting is applied.
    X: 512
    Y: 512
    Z: 300



Under Cubemap generation, click Generate.



Press CtrlS to save your level.
