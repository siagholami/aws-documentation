5c: Bottom Toolbar

The toolbar at the bottom of the Perspective viewport displays information for objects selected in your viewport, such as its XYZ position in the level. You can also speed up or slow down navigation speed, mute audio, go to a specific position, and more.
The default navigation speed is 0.10. Try speeding up and slowing down your navigation.
To change the viewport navigation speed


First, become familiar with the default navigation speed by pressing W, S, A, and D in turn to strafe forward, backward, left, and right.


In the bottom toolbar, click the Speed setting 1.



Click in your viewport and press W, S, A, and D in turn to test the new, faster setting.

In the bottom toolbar, click the Speed setting 10.

Click in your viewport and press W, S, A, and D in turn to test this very fast setting, which you can use to navigate quickly over long distances.

You can also input custom speeds. Try a speed of 0.5, for example. Try a speed of 5. Experiment with the navigation speeds.

For more information about the other settings in the bottom toolbar, see Using the Bottom Toolbar in the Amazon Lumberyard User Guide.
