Adding Door Sounds
You add two Lua Script components and two audio components to the EntryDoor_Trigger entity to trigger sounds of a door opening and closing.
To add the Lua Script component for door sounds

In the Entity Outliner, select EntryDoor_Trigger. 

In the Entity Inspector, click Add Component, and then add the Lua Script component. Repeat this step to add a second Lua Script component.


In the first Lua Script component, click Browse (...) next to the Script box.

Navigate to StarterGame\Scripts\Triggers and select TriggerEventAudioReceiver.lua. Click OK.


In the properties that appear, set the following values: 
    EventName – Type OpenEntryDoor
    Sound – Type Play_AMZ_sfx_spfx_ship_door_open
    TriggerOnce – Clear the check box



In the second Lua Script component, click Browse (...) next to the Script box.


Navigate to StarterGame\Scripts\Triggers and select TriggerEventAudioReceiver.lua. Click OK.

In the properties that appear, set the following values: 
    EventName – Type CloseEntryDoor
    Sounds – Type Play_AMZ_sfx_spfx_ship_door_close
    TriggerOnce – Clear the check box


Now you add two audio components: Audio Proxy and Audio Trigger. The Audio Proxy component is required on any entity that uses audio. The Audio Trigger component triggers the audio.
To add the audio components


In the Entity Outliner, select the EntryDoor_Trigger entity.


In the Entity Inspector, click Add Component. Under Audio, select Audio Proxy. 



Click Add Component again. Under Audio, select Audio Trigger. 



Your two Lua Script components and your two audio components should look like the following.



Press CtrlS to save your level.


Press CtrlG to play your level. When you approach the door, you should hear the door opening and closing in concert with those actions.


Press Esc to quit.
