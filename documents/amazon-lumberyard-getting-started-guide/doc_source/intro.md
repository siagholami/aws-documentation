# Introduction to Lumberyard Editor<a name="intro"></a>

The *Getting Started Guide for Amazon Lumberyard Editor* is a tutorial series that guides you through the basics of building a game in Lumberyard\. You'll create a lush mountainous landscape, build a maze within it, place a player character, position enemy characters, install a simple UI, and finally, export and play your game\. By working through this series, you will gain an understanding of the fundamental workflows and tools within Lumberyard\. As you proceed, you can refer back to the orientation level, which represents the completed level that you are building\.

Before you get started, [install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/setting-up-intro.html) Lumberyard\.

Each of the tutorials in this 12\-part tutorial series teaches or demonstrates a Lumberyard concept\. Each tutorial takes 10 to 30 minutes, depending on your level of experience\.
+ [1: Understanding the Lumberyard Interface](understanding.md) – Open the orientation level to explore and learn Lumberyard's basic manipulation and navigation tools\. This level also represents the end product of the game you'll build during this series\. Refer to this level whenever you want to compare your level to the completed level\.
+ [2: Building the Environment](creating-environment.md) – Create your own new level and then import a heightmap and texture map to give your landscape a mountainous look\. Place a player character to play and explore your level\.
+ [3: Gathering Your Building Blocks](gathering-building-blocks.md) – Add the doorway pieces of the maze structure\. Learn how entities and components make objects behave like their real\-world versions\.
+ [4: Using Slices to Build the Maze](using-slices.md) – Use prebuilt slices to add the exterior and interior maze walls and lamp posts\. Learn how the slices feature makes it simple to change one lamp post and then save the change to modify all the lamp posts at once\.
+ [5: Adding Enemy AI Characters](ai.md) – Place enemy AI sentries inside the maze and set their behavior to patrol the area\.
+ [6: Scripting Gameplay](scripting.md) – Use Lua scripts to make doors open and close, require an item to be collected, and time the player's passage through the maze\.
+ [7: Applying Physics to Stacked Crates](physics.md) – Stack crates to construct a wall\. Apply physics properties to the crates so that the player can knock the crate wall down\.
+ [8: Sculpting the Terrain](vegetation.md) – Create a lush vegetative environment by adding trees, grass, dirt, and rocks\. Build a well\-worn footpath that leads to and away from the maze\.
+ [9: Enhancing Your Level with Details](enhancing.md) – Enhance the look of your environment by adding decals such as a door number and scorch marks\. Create a more interesting environment by adding broken pipes, erupting steam, ambient particles in the air, and industrial junk\.
+ [10: Lighting the Environment](lighting.md) – Illuminate your level by creating environmental probes, setting the time of day, and adding lights to your lamps\.
+ [11: Setting Up the UI](ui.md) – Incorporate a simple UI for your game\.
+ [12: Exporting Your Game](exporting.md) – Export your game to an executable file and play it\.

The intent of this series is to create your own level 'from scratch' and follow all the tutorials sequentially\. You can, however, skip to any tutorial in this series without first completing all preceding tutorials\. To do this, open a prebuilt level file that has all the steps from that level and all preceding tutorials already completed\. For example, if you want to explore the AI tutorial \(number 5\) without completing levels 1 through 4, open **GSG\_04\_Slices**\.

**To open a prebuilt level file**

1. [Install](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gamedev-tutorials/Tutorials/Getting_Started_01_Download-Install-Express_1.10.pdf) and open Lumberyard\.

1. In the **Welcome to Lumberyard** screen, click **Open Level**\.

1. Navigate to the `Levels\GettingStartedGuide` directory, select the level that you want, and then click **Open**\.
