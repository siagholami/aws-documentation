# 4: Using Slices to Build the Maze<a name="using-slices"></a>

A slice is a special kind of asset \(a `.slice` file\) that is composed of a group of entities and their components\. You can place, or instantiate, slices throughout your level quickly and easily\. If you modify one slice instance, such as adding a component or changing a property, you can save your changes to update all the other slice instances\.

You can also independently edit an individual slice instance and then not save the change\. This results in a unique slice instance\.
