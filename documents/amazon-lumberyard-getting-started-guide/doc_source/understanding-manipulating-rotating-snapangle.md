# Snapping to Angle<a name="understanding-manipulating-rotating-snapangle"></a>

The **Snap Angle** feature is on by default\. With this feature on, you can rotate an object by incremental degrees\. You can make the snap angles smaller or larger depending on your needs\. The smaller your snap angle, the finer control you have when rotating your objects\. The following image demonstrates **Snap Angle** both on and off\.

**Snap Angle** \(on by default\) sets the incremental degrees of rotation that an object snaps to when you rotate it\. To turn **Snap Angle** off or on, click the icon\. To customize the **Snap Angle** degrees of rotation, click the down arrow to the right of the icon\. Adjust this value to increase or decrease the degree of rotation with each snap\.

Next, you learn how to scale your boulder to make it smaller or larger\.
