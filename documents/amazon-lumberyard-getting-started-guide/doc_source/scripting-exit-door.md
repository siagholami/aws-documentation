# Adding the Exit Door<a name="scripting-exit-door"></a>

Setting up the exit door uses a procedure that is similar to setting up the entry door\. To add the exit door, you do the following:
+ [Duplicate and rename the door entity](scripting-exit-door-duplicate.md) – Create a copy of the existing entry door and rename it\.
+ [Modify the conditions that open the exit door](scripting-exit-door-lua.md) – Remove the trigger area and prepare the door to open only after the player collects a hidden pickup item\.
+ [Set up a new trigger area](scripting-exit-door-adjust.md) – Add a new trigger area that closes the door after the player collects the pickup item and exits the maze\.
