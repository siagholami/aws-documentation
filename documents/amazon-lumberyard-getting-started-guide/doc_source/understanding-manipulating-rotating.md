# Rotating an Object<a name="understanding-manipulating-rotating"></a>

You can rotate the currently selected object in your viewport\. When you rotate an object with the **Rotate** tool, you can rotate around the X, Y, or Z axis\. Think of the rotational axes as a pole around which the object spins or rotates\. For example, rotating around the Z axis would be like a car driving in circles around a pole in the ground\. A large outer circle also surrounds the entire gizmo\. Select and drag this circle to rotate the object in relation to the screen display\. 

You can distinguish which circles belong to which axis by their color marking \(red circle = red X axis, green circle = green Y axis\)\.
