The **Entity Inspector** \(on the right side of the viewport\) displays all the components for the currently selected entity in the **Entity Outliner** \(on the left side of the viewport\)\. You use the **Entity Inspector** to add and remove components and to modify settings on components\. This gives the entity customized abilities, such as triggering a particular action, making sounds, colliding with other objects, and so on\.

For more information about the **Entity Inspector**, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/component-entity-inspector.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/component-entity-inspector.html) in the *Amazon Lumberyard User Guide*\.
