# Adding Physics and Mesh Collider Components<a name="scripting-entry-door-components"></a>

As you learned in an earlier tutorial, a character can interact and collide with an object only if the object has collider and physics components\. Without these components, a character passes right through the object\. 

**To add mesh collider and physics components to the door**

1. In the **Entity Outliner**, select **gsg\_maze\_door**\.
