# 6: Scripting Gameplay<a name="scripting"></a>

You use Lua script commands to script gameplay events such as triggering doors to open when the game character approaches and to close once he's through\. You set up a timer to display in the UI as well as triggers that start and stop it\. Finally, you add a pickup item that the character needs to exit the maze\.
