# Duplicating an Entity<a name="placing-entities-duplicating"></a>

You can easily duplicate a selected entity\. The duplicated entity is identical to the original entity, and even has the same initial transform \(position, scale, rotation\)\. This means that it is duplicated on top of the original entity and is not visible until you move your mouse pointer and click to place it\.

1. If the tower is not still selected, then select it\.

   Duplicate the tower by pressing **Ctrl\+D**\. Move your mouse pointer to adjust the second tower's position, and then click to place it\.
**Tip**  
[**Snap to Grid**](understanding-manipulating-moving-snapgrid.md) is on by default\. This makes objects snap to points on a grid when you move them\. To more precisely place objects, turn off **Snap to Grid**\.

1. Using the [essential tools](understanding-manipulating.md) you learned about in an earlier tutorial, adjust the position of your entities to match the following picture\.
