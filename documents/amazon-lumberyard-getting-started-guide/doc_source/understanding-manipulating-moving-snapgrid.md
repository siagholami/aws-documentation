# Snapping to Grid<a name="understanding-manipulating-moving-snapgrid"></a>

The **Snap to Grid** feature is on by default\. With this feature on, you can move an object by aligning it to points along a grid\. You can make the grid smaller or larger depending on your needs\. The smaller your grid, the finer control you have when moving your objects\. The following image shows the boulder being moved along a large grid\.
