By default, only the **Console**'s title bar is visible\. To view the console, which is below the **Perspective** viewport, drag the upper edge of the **Console** title bar up to expand it\. The console displays input and output data for Lumberyard Editor and any custom code that is written for your level\. Advanced users can enter console commands into the gray bar on the bottom of the **Console** window\.

For more information about the console, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/console-intro.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/console-intro.html) in the *Amazon Lumberyard User Guide*\.
