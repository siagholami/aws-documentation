# Scaling an Object<a name="understanding-manipulating-scaling"></a>

To scale an object means to make it larger or smaller\. 

By default, the proportions of your object are locked\. This means that whichever axis you choose to scale, your object grows or shrinks on all axes at the same time\. When you scale it up, it simply looks like a bigger version of itself\. When you scale it down, it looks like a smaller version of itself\.

You can, however, make an object taller without affecting its width, or wider without affecting its height\. To do this, click the **Lock Scale** toggle at the bottom of the perspective viewport\. This unlocks the proportions so that you can scale just one axis\.

      This unlocks the proportions so that you can adjust one axis without affecting the others\.

      If **Lock Scale** has an orange border, that means it is on\. If it is on, click it once to turn it off\.
