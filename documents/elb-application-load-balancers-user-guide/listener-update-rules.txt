Listener rules for your Application Load Balancer
The rules that you define for your listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to the targets in one or more target groups.
Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions. For more information, see Listener rules.
Note
The console displays a relative sequence number for each rule, not the rule priority. You can get the priority of a rule by describing it using the AWS CLI or the Elastic Load Balancing API.
Requirements

Each rule must include exactly one of the following actions: forward, redirect, or fixed-response, and it must be the last action to be performed.
Each rule can include zero or one of the following conditions: host-header, http-request-method, path-pattern, and source-ip, and zero or more of the following conditions: http-header and query-string.
You can specify up to three comparison strings per condition and up to five per rule.
A forward action routes requests to its target group. Before you add a forward action, create the target group and add targets to it. For more information, see Create a target group.

Add a rule
You define a default rule when you create a listener, and you can define additional nondefault rules at any time.
To add a rule using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


For the listener to update, choose View/edit rules.


Choose the Add rules icon (the plus sign) in the menu bar, which adds Insert Rule icons at the locations where you can insert a rule in the priority order.



Choose one of the Insert Rule icons added in the previous step.


Add one or more conditions as follows:


To add a host header condition, choose Add condition, Host header and enter the hostname (for example, *.example.com). To save the condition, choose the checkmark icon.
The maximum size of each string is 128 characters. The comparison is not case-sensitive. The following wildcard characters are supported: * and ?.


To add a path condition, choose Add condition, Path and enter the path pattern (for example, /img/*). To save the condition, choose the checkmark icon.
The maximum size of each string is 128 characters. The comparison is case-sensitive. The following wildcard characters are supported: * and ?.


To add an HTTP header condition, choose Add condition, Http header. Enter the name of the header and add one or more comparison strings. To save the condition, choose the checkmark icon.
The maximum size of each header name is 40 characters, the header name is not case-sensitive, and wildcards are not supported. The maximum size of each comparison string is 128 characters and the following wildcard characters are supported: * and ?. The comparison is not case-sensitive.


To add an HTTP request method condition, choose Add condition, Http request method and add one or more method names. To save the condition, choose the checkmark icon.
The maximum size of each name is 40 characters. The allowed characters are A-Z, hyphen (-), and underscore (_). The comparison is case sensitive. Wildcards are not supported.


To add a query string condition, choose Add condition, Query string and add one or more key/value pairs. For each key/value pair, you can omit the key and specify only the value. To save the condition, choose the checkmark icon.
The maximum size of each string is 128 characters. The comparison is not case-sensitive. The following wildcard characters are supported: * and ?.


To add a source IP condition, choose Add condition, Source IP and add one or more CIDR blocks. To save the condition, choose the checkmark icon.
You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Wildcards are not supported.


(Optional, HTTPS listener) To authenticate users, choose Add action, Authenticate and provide the requested information. To save the action, choose the checkmark icon. For more information, see Authenticate users using an Application Load Balancer.


Add one of the following actions:
    To add a forward action, choose Add action, Forward to and choose one or more target groups. If you use more than one target group, select a weight for each target group and optionally enable target group stickiness. If you enable target group stickiness and there is more than one target group, you must also enable sticky sessions on the target groups. To save the action, choose the checkmark icon. For more information, see Forward actions.
    To add a redirect action, choose Add action, Redirect to and provide the URL for the redirect. To save the action, choose the checkmark icon. For more information, see Redirect actions.
    To add a fixed-response action, choose Add action, Return fixed response and provide a response code and optional response body. To save the action, choose the checkmark icon. For more information, see Fixed-response actions.



Choose Save.


(Optional) To change the order of the rule, use the arrows and then choose Save. The default rule always has the last priority.


To leave this screen, choose the Back to the load balancer icon (the back button) in the menu bar.


To add a rule using the AWS CLI
Use the create-rule command to create the rule. Use the describe-rules command to view information about the rule.
Edit a rule
You can edit the action and conditions for a rule at any time. Rule updates do not take effect immediately, so requests could be routed using the previous rule configuration for a short time after you update a rule. Any in-flight requests are completed.
To edit a rule using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


For the listener to update, choose View/edit rules.


Choose the Edit rules icon (the pencil) in the menu bar.



For the rule to edit, choose the Edit rules icon (the pencil).


(Optional) Modify the conditions and actions as needed. For example, you can edit a condition or action (pencil icon), add a condition, add an authenticate action to a rule for an HTTPS listener, or delete a condition or action (trash can icon). You can't add conditions to the default rule.



Choose Update.


To leave this screen, choose the Back to the load balancer icon (the back button) in the menu bar.


To edit a rule using the AWS CLI
Use the modify-rule command.
Reorder rules
Rules are evaluated in priority order, from the lowest value to the highest value. The default rule is evaluated last. You can change the priority of a nondefault rule at any time. You cannot change the priority of the default rule.
Note
The console displays a relative sequence number for each rule, not the rule priority. When you reorder rules using the console, they get new rule priorities based on the existing rule priorities. To set the priority of a rule to a specific value, use the AWS CLI or the Elastic Load Balancing API.
To reorder rules using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


For the listener to update, choose View/edit rules.


Choose the Reorder rules icon (the arrows) in the menu bar.



Select the check box next to a rule, and then use the arrows to give the rule a new priority. The default rule always has the last priority.


When you have finished reordering rules, choose Save.


To leave this screen, choose the Back to the load balancer icon (the back button) in the menu bar.


To update rule priorities using the AWS CLI
Use the set-rule-priorities command.
Delete a rule
You can delete the nondefault rules for a listener at any time. You cannot delete the default rule for a listener. When you delete a listener, all its rules are deleted.
To delete a rule using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


For the listener to update, choose View/edit rules.


Choose the Delete rules icon (the minus sign) in the menu bar.


Select the check box for the rule and choose Delete. You can't delete the default rule for the listener.


To leave this screen, choose the Back to the load balancer icon (the back button) in the menu bar.


To delete a rule using the AWS CLI
