Update an HTTPS listener for your Application Load Balancer
After you create an HTTPS listener, you can replace the default certificate, update the certificate list, or replace the security policy.
Limitation
ACM supports RSA certificates with a 4096 key length and EC certificates. However, you cannot install these certificates on your load balancer through integration with ACM. You must upload these certificates to IAM in order to use them with your load balancer.

 Replace the default certificate
 Add certificates to the certificate list
 Remove certificates from the certificate list
 Update the security policy
Replace the default certificate
You can replace the default certificate for your listener using the following procedure. For more information, see SSL certificates.
To change the default certificate using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


Select the check box for the listener and choose Edit.


For Default SSL certificate, do one of the following:
    If you created or imported a certificate using AWS Certificate Manager, choose From ACM and choose the certificate.
    If you uploaded a certificate using IAM, choose From IAM and choose the certificate.


Choose Update.


To change the default certificate using the AWS CLI
Use the modify-listener command.
Add certificates to the certificate list
You can add certificates to the certificate list for your listener using the following procedure. When you first create an HTTPS listener, the certificate list is empty. You can add one or more certificates. You can optionally add the default certificate to ensure that this certificate is used with the SNI protocol even if it is replaced as the default certificate. For more information, see SSL certificates.
To add certificates to the certificate list using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


For the HTTPS listener to update, choose View/edit certificates, which displays the default certificate followed by any other certificates that you've added to the listener.


Choose the Add certificates icon (the plus sign) in the menu bar, which displays the default certificate followed by any other certificates managed by ACM and IAM. If you've already added a certificate to the listener, its check box is selected and disabled.


To add certificates that are already managed by ACM or IAM, select the check boxes for the certificates and choose Add.


If you have a certificate that isn't managed by ACM or IAM, import it to ACM and add it to your listener as follows:


Choose Import certificate.


For Certificate private key, paste the PEM-encoded, unencrypted private key for the certificate.


For Certificate body, paste the PEM-encoded certificate.


(Optional) For Certificate chain, paste the PEM-encoded certificate chain.


Choose Import. The newly imported certificate appears in the list of available certificates and is selected.


Choose Add.


To leave this screen, choose the Back to the load balancer icon (the back button) in the menu bar.


To add a certificate to the certificate list using the AWS CLI
Use the add-listener-certificates command.
Remove certificates from the certificate list
You can remove certificates from the certificate list for an HTTPS listener using the following procedure. To remove the default certificate for an HTTPS listener, see Replace the default certificate.
To remove certificates from the certificate list using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


For the listener to update, choose View/edit certificates, which displays the default certificate followed by any other certificates that you've added to the listener.


Choose the Remove certificates icon (the minus sign) in the menu bar.


Select the check boxes for the certificates and choose Remove.

To remove a certificate from the certificate list using the AWS CLI
Use the remove-listener-certificates command.
Update the security policy
When you create an HTTPS listener, you can select the security policy that meets your needs. When a new security policy is added, you can update your HTTPS listener to use the new security policy. Application Load Balancers do not support custom security policies. For more information, see Security policies.
To update the security policy using the console


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, choose Load Balancers.


Select the load balancer and choose Listeners.


Select the check box for the HTTPS listener and choose Edit.
