IP address types for your Application Load Balancer
You can configure your Application Load Balancer so that clients can communicate with the load balancer using IPv4 addresses only, or using both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The load balancer communicates with targets using IPv4 addresses, regardless of how the client communicates with the load balancer. For more information, see IP address type.
IPv6 requirements
 An internet-facing load balancer with the dualstack IP address type. You can set the IP address type when you create the load balancer and update it at any time.
 The virtual private cloud (VPC) and subnets that you specify for the load balancer must have associated IPv6 CIDR blocks. For more information, see IPv6 addresses in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.
 The route tables for the load balancer subnets must route IPv6 traffic.
 The security groups for the load balancer must allow IPv6 traffic.
 The network ACLs for the load balancer subnets must allow IPv6 traffic.
To set the IP address type at creation
Configure settings as described in Create a Load Balancer.
