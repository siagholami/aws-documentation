Tags for your Application Load Balancer
Tags help you to categorize your load balancers in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.
You can add multiple tags to each load balancer. Tag keys must be unique for each load balancer. If you add a tag with a key that is already associated with the load balancer, it updates the value of that tag.
When you are finished with a tag, you can remove it from your load balancer.
Restrictions
 Maximum number of tags per resource—50
 Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters
 Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters
 Tag keys and values are case sensitive. Allowed characters are letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters:  - = . _ : / @. Do not use leading or trailing spaces.
 Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values because it is reserved for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
