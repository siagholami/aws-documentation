Legacy IAM roles for AWS SMS
Before the introduction of AWSServiceRoleForSMS, you would have been required to create a service role and a launch role to grant AWS SMS the permissions that it needs. It is no longer necessary for you to create these roles.
Configure a service role for AWS SMS
Use the following procedure to create an IAM role that grants permissions to AWS SMS to place migrated resources into your Amazon EC2 account.
To create the IAM role for AWS SMS


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles, Create role.


Under Choose the service that will use this role, choose SMS, Next: Permissions. 


Under Attached permissions policies, confirm that the policy ServerMigrationServiceRole is visible and choose Next: Review.


Under Review, for Role name, enter sms.
Note
Alternatively, you can apply a different name. However, you must then specify the role name explicitly each time that you create a replication job or an application.


Choose Create role. You should now see the sms role in the list of available roles.


Configure a launch role for AWS SMS
If you plan to launch applications, you need an AWS SMS launch role. You assign this role using the PutAppLaunchConfiguration API. When the LaunchApp API is called, the role is used by AWS CloudFormation. 
To create a launch role for AWS SMS


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles, Create role.


Under Choose the service that will use this role, choose CloudFormation, Next: Permissions. 


Under Attached permissions policies, confirm that the policy ServerMigrationServiceLaunchRole is visible and choose Next: Review.


Under Review, for Role name, enter sms-launch. 
Note
Alternatively, you can apply a different name. However, you must then specify the role name explicitly each time that you create a launch configuration for an application.


Choose Create role. You should now see the sms-launch role in the list of available roles.
