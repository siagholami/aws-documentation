Monitoring Step Functions Using CloudWatch
Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of AWS Step Functions and your AWS solutions. You should collect as much monitoring data from the AWS services that you use so that you can more easily debug any multi-point failures. Before you start monitoring Step Functions, you should create a monitoring plan that answers the following questions:
 What are your monitoring goals?
 What resources will you monitor?
 How often will you monitor these resources?
 What monitoring tools will you use?
 Who will perform the monitoring tasks?
 Who should be notified when something goes wrong?
The next step is to establish a baseline for normal Step Functions performance in your environment. To do this, measure performance at various times and under different load conditions. As you monitor Step Functions, consider storing historical monitoring data. Such data can give you a baseline to compare against current performance data, to identify normal performance patterns and performance anomalies, and to devise ways to address issues.
For example, with Step Functions, you can monitor how many activities or Lambda tasks fail due to a heartbeat timeout. When performance falls outside your established baseline, you might have to change your heartbeat interval.
To establish a baseline you should, at a minimum, monitor the following metrics:
  ActivitiesStarted 
  ActivitiesTimedOut 
  ExecutionsStarted 
  ExecutionsTimedOut 
  LambdaFunctionsStarted 
  LambdaFunctionsTimedOut 
The following sections describe metrics that Step Functions provides to Amazon CloudWatch. You can use these metrics to track your state machines and activities and to set alarms on threshold values. You can view metrics using the AWS Management Console.

Metrics That Report a Time Interval
Some of the Step Functions CloudWatch metrics are time intervals, always measured in milliseconds. These metrics generally correspond to stages of your execution for which you can set state machine, activity, and Lambda function timeouts, with descriptive names.
For example, the ActivityRunTime metric measures the time it takes for an activity to complete after it begins to execute. You can set a timeout value for the same time period.
In the CloudWatch console, you can get the best results if you choose average as the display statistic for time interval metrics.
Metrics That Report a Count
Some of the Step Functions CloudWatch metrics report results as a count. For example, ExecutionsFailed records the number of failed state machine executions.
In the CloudWatch console, you can get the best results if you choose sum as the display statistic for count metrics.
Execution Metrics
The AWS/States namespace includes the following metrics for Step Functions executions.
