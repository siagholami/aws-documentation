Manage AWS Step Functions Executions as an Integrated Service
Step Functions integrates with its own API as a service integration. This allows Step Functions to start a new execution of a state machine directly from the task state of a running execution. Use nested workflow executions to reduce the complexity of your main workflows and to reuse common processes when building new workflows.

   Response syntax
The following includes a Task state that starts an execution of another state machine and waits for it to complete.
{  
   "Type":"Task",
   "Resource":"arn:aws:states:::states:startExecution.sync",
   "Parameters":{  
      "Input":{
        "Comment": "Hello world!"
       },
      "StateMachineArn":"arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:stateMachine:HelloWorld",
      "Name":"ExecutionName"
   },
   "End":true
}

{  
   "Type":"Task",
   "Resource":"arn:aws:states:::states:startExecution",
   "Parameters":{  
      "Input":{
        "Comment": "Hello world!"

}
The following includes a Task state that implements the callback service integration pattern.
{ 
   "Type":"Task",
   "Resource":"arn:aws:states:::states:startExecution.waitForTaskToken",
   "Parameters":{ 
      "Input":{
        "Comment": "Hello world!",
        "token.$": "$$.Task.Token"
       },
      "StateMachineArn":"arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:stateMachine:HelloWorld",
      "Name":"ExecutionName"
   },
   "End":true
}
To associate a nested workflow execution with the parent execution that started it, pass a specially named parameter that includes the execution Id pulled from the context object. When starting a nested execution, use a parameter named AWS_STEP_FUNCTIONS_STARTED_BY_EXECUTION_ID. Pass the execution ID by appending .$ to the parameter name, and referencing the ID in the context object with $$.Execution.Id. For more information, see Accessing the Context Object.

   "Type":"Task",
   "Resource":"arn:aws:states:::states:startExecution.sync",
   "Parameters":{  
      "Input":{
        "Comment": "Hello world!",
        "AWS_STEP_FUNCTIONS_STARTED_BY_EXECUTION_ID.$": "$$.Execution.Id"
       },
      "StateMachineArn":"arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:stateMachine:HelloWorld",
      "Name":"ExecutionName"
   },
   "End":true
