Setting Alarms for Step Functions
You can use CloudWatch alarms to perform actions. For example, if you want to know when an alarm threshold is reached, you can set an alarm to send a notification to an Amazon SNS topic or to send an email when the StateMachinesFailed metric rises above a certain threshold.
To set an alarm on a metric


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console.


Choose Metrics, and on the All Metrics tab, choose States.



If you ran any executions recently, you will see up to three types of metrics:
     Execution Metrics 
     Activity Function Metrics 
     Lambda Function Metrics 


Choose a metric type to see a list of metrics.



Choose a metric, and then choose Graphed metrics.


Choose  next to a metric on the list.



The Create Alarm page is displayed.


Enter the values for the Alarm threshold and Actions, and then choose Create Alarm.
