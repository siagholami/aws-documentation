# Sample Projects<a name="create-sample-projects"></a>

In the [AWS Step Functions console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/states/home?region=us-east-1#/), you can choose one of the following state machine sample projects to automatically create the state machine **Code**, **Visual Workflow**, and all related AWS resources for the project\. 

Each of the sample projects provisions a fully functional state machine, and creates the related resources for it to run\. When you create a sample project, Step Functions uses AWS CloudFormation to create the related resources referenced by the state machine\.
