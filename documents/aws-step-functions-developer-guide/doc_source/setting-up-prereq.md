# Prerequisites For Setting Up Step Functions<a name="setting-up-prereq"></a>

Before you can get started using AWS Step Functions, you must create these AWS resources:

## Create an AWS Account<a name="sfn-creating-aws-account"></a>

To access any AWS service, you first need to create an [ AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/), an Amazon\.com account that can use AWS products\. You can use your AWS account to view your activity and usage reports and to manage authentication and access\.

To avoid using your AWS account root user for Step Functions actions, it is a best practice to create an IAM user for each person who needs administrative access to Step Functions\.

**To set up a new account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

## Create an IAM User<a name="sfn-creating-iam-user"></a>

**To create an administrator user for yourself and add the user to an administrators group \(console\)**

1. Use your AWS account email address and password to sign in as the *[AWS account root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html)* to the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.
**Note**  
We strongly recommend that you adhere to the best practice of using the **Administrator** IAM user below and securely lock away the root user credentials\. Sign in as the root user only to perform a few [account and service management tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users** and then choose **Add user**\.

1. For **User name**, enter **Administrator**\.

1. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**\. Then select **Custom password**, and then enter your new password in the text box\.

1. \(Optional\) By default, AWS requires the new user to create a new password when first signing in\. You can clear the check box next to **User must create a new password at next sign\-in** to allow the new user to reset their password after they sign in\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. Under **Set permissions**, choose **Add user to group**\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

1. In the **Create group** dialog box, for **Group name** enter **Administrators**\.

1. Choose **Filter policies**, and then select **AWS managed \-job function** to filter the table contents\.

1. In the policy list, select the check box for **AdministratorAccess**\. Then choose **Create group**\.
**Note**  
You must activate IAM user and role access to Billing before you can use the `AdministratorAccess` permissions to access the AWS Billing and Cost Management console\. To do this, follow the instructions in [step 1 of the tutorial about delegating access to the billing console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html)\.

1. Back in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group\. Choose **Refresh** if necessary to see the group in the list\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key\-value pairs\. For more information about using tags in IAM, see [Tagging IAM Entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

1. Choose **Next: Review** to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user\. When you are ready to proceed, choose **Create user**\.

You can use this same process to create more groups and users and to give your users access to your AWS account resources\. To learn about using policies that restrict user permissions to specific AWS resources, see [Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) and [Example Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_examples.html)\.

## Step 3: Get Your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key<a name="sfn-getting-access-key-id-secret-access-key"></a>

To use Step Functions actions \(for example, using Java or through the AWS Command Line Interface\), you need an access key ID and a secret access key\.

**Note**  
The access key ID and secret access key are specific to AWS Identity and Access Management\. Don't confuse them with credentials for other AWS services, such as Amazon EC2 key pairs\.

Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS\. If you don't have access keys, you can create them from the AWS Management Console\. As a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user access keys for any task where it's not required\. Instead, [create a new administrator IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) with access keys for yourself\.

The only time that you can view or download the secret access key is when you create the keys\. You cannot recover them later\. However, you can create new access keys at any time\. You must also have permissions to perform the required IAM actions\. For more information, see [Permissions Required to Access IAM Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_permissions-required.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**To create access keys for an IAM user**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the user whose access keys you want to create, and then choose the **Security credentials** tab\.

1. In the **Access keys** section, choose **Create access key**\.

1. To view the new access key pair, choose **Show**\. You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes\. Your credentials will look something like this:
   + Access key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
   + Secret access key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

1. To download the key pair, choose **Download \.csv file**\. Store the keys in a secure location\. You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes\.

   Keep the keys confidential in order to protect your AWS account and never email them\. Do not share them outside your organization, even if an inquiry appears to come from AWS or Amazon\.com\. No one who legitimately represents Amazon will ever ask you for your secret key\.

1. After you download the `.csv` file, choose **Close**\. When you create an access key, the key pair is active by default, and you can use the pair right away\.
