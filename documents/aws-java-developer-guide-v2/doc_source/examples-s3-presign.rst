Working with Amazon S3 Presigned URLs

    :description: How to work with Presigned buckets using the AWS SDK for Java 2.x.

You can use a :aws-java-class:`S3Presigner <services/s3/presigner/S3Presigner>` object to sign an |S3| ``SdkRequest``
so that it's executed without requiring authentication on the part of the caller.
For example, assume Alice has access to an S3 object, and she wants to temporarily share access to that object with Bob.
Alice can generate a pre-signed :aws-java-class:`GetObjectRequest <services/s3/model/GetObjectRequest>` object
to secure share with Bob so that he can download the object without requiring
access to Alice's credentials.

.. _generate-presignedurl:

Generate a Presigned URL and Upload an Object
=============================================

Build a :aws-java-class:`S3Presigner <services/s3/presigner/S3Presigner>` object that represents the client object.
Next create a :aws-java-class:`PresignedPutObjectRequest <services/s3/presigner/model/PresignedPutObjectRequest>` object
that can be executed at a later time without requiring additional signing or authentication. When you create this object,
you can specify the bucket name and the key name. In addition,
you can also specify the time in minutes that the bucket can be accessed without using credentials by invoking the
``signatureDuration`` method (as shown in the following code example).

You can use the :aws-java-class:`PresignedPutObjectRequest <services/s3/presigner/model/PresignedPutObjectRequest>` object to
obtain the URL by invoking its ``url`` method.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: presigned.java2.generatepresignedurl.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

The following Java code example uploads content to a presigned S3 bucket.

.. literalinclude:: presigned.java2.generatepresignedurl.main.txt
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-s3:`complete example <GeneratePresignedUrlAndUploadObject.java>` on GitHub.


.. _get-presignedobject:

Get a Presigned Object
======================

Build a :aws-java-class:`S3Presigner <services/s3/presigner/S3Presigner>` object that represents the client object.
Next, create a :aws-java-class:`GetObjectRequest <services/s3/model/GetObjectRequest>` object
and specify the bucket name and key name. In addition, create a
:aws-java-class:`GetObjectPresignRequest <services/s3/presigner/model/GetObjectPresignRequest>` object that
can be executed at a later time without requiring additional signing or authentication. When you create this object, you can
specify the time in minutes that the bucket can be accessed without using credentials by invoking the
``signatureDuration`` method (as shown in the following code example).

Invoke the ``presignGetObject`` method that belongs to the :aws-java-class:`S3Presigner <services/s3/presigner/S3Presigner>` object to create a
:aws-java-class:`PresignedPutObjectRequest <services/s3/presigner/model/PresignedPutObjectRequest>` object.
You can invoke this object's ``url`` method to obtain the URL to use. Once you have the URL, you can use standard HTTP Java logic to read the contents of the bucket, as shown
in the following Java code example.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: presigned.java2.getobjectpresigned.import.txt

**Code**

The following Java code example reads content from a presigned S3 bucket.
