Subscribing to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

    :description: How to use Amazon Kinesis data streams to get results from Amazon Kinesis using the AWS SDK for Java 2.x.
    :keywords: Kinesis, AWS SDK for Java 2.x, async streaming

The following examples show you how to retrieve and process data from |AKSlong|
using the :methodname:`subscribeToShard` method.
|AKS| now employs the enhanced fanout feature and a
low-latency HTTP/2 data retrieval API, making it
easier for developers to run multiple low-latency, high-performance applications
on the same |AK| Data Stream.


Set Up
======

First, create an asynchronous |AK| client and a
:aws-java-class:`SubscribeToShardRequest <services/kinesis/model/SubscribeToShardRequest>` object.
These objects are used in each of the following examples to subscribe to |AK| events.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_example.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_example.setup.txt
   :dedent: 8
   :language: java


Use the Builder Interface
=========================

You can use the :methodname:`builder` method to simplify the creation of the
:aws-java-class:`SubscribeToShardResponseHandler <services/kinesis/model/SubscribeToShardResponseHandler>`.

Using the builder, you can set each lifecycle callback with a method call instead of implementing
the full interface.

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_example.lifecycle_callback.txt
  :dedent: 4
  :language: java

For more control of the publisher, you can use the :methodname:`publisherTransformer`
method to customize the publisher.

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_example.publish_transformer.txt
  :dedent: 4
  :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-kinesis:`complete example <KinesisStreamEx.java>` on GitHub.

Use a Custom Response Handler
=============================

For full control of the subscriber and publisher, implement the
:aws-java-class:`SubscribeToShardResponseHandler <services/kinesis/model/SubscribeToShardResponseHandler>` interface.

In this example, you implement the :methodname:`onEventStream` method, which allows
you full access to the publisher. This demonstrates how to transform the publisher to
event records for printing by the subscriber.

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_example.custom_handler.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-kinesis:`complete example <KinesisStreamEx.java>` on GitHub.

Use the Visitor Interface
=========================

You can use a
:aws-java-class:`Visitor <services/kinesis/model/SubscribeToShardResponseHandler\Visitor>` object
to subscribe to specific events you're interested in watching.

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_example.visitor.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-kinesis:`complete example <KinesisStreamEx.java>` on GitHub.

Use a Custom Subscriber
=======================

You can also implement your own custom subscriber to subscribe to the stream.

This code snippet shows an example subscriber.

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_example.custom_subscriber.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

You can pass that custom subscriber to the :methodname:`subscribe` method, similarly
to preview examples. The following code snippet shows this example.

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_example.subscribe.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-kinesis:`complete example <KinesisStreamEx.java>` on GitHub.

Write data records into a Kinesis data stream
=============================================
You can use the :aws-java-class:`KinesisClient <services/kinesis/KinesisClient>` object to write data records into a Kinesis data stream by using the
:methodname:`putRecords` method. To successfully invoke this method, create a :aws-java-class:`PutRecordsRequest <services/kinesis/model/PutRecordsRequest>` object. You
pass the name of the data steam to the :methodname:`streamName` method. Also you must pass the data by using the :data:`putRecords` method (as shown in the following code example).

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_rx_example.import.txt
  :language: java

In the following Java code example, notice that **StockTrade** object is used as the data to write to the Kinesis data stream. Before running this example, ensure that you have created the data steam.

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_example.subscribe.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-kinesis:`complete example <KinesisStreamEx.java>` on GitHub.


Use a Third-Party Library
==========================

You can use other third-party libraries instead of implementing a custom subscriber.
This example demonstrates using the RxJava implementation,
but you can use any library that implements the Reactive Streams interfaces.
See the `RxJava wiki page on Github <https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki>`_
for more information on that library.

To use the library, add it as a dependency. If you're using Maven, the example shows the
POM snippet to use.

**POM Entry**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/kinesis/pom.xml
   :lines: 13-17
   :language: xml

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_rx_example.import.txt
  :language: java

This example uses RxJava in the :methodname:`onEventStream` lifecycle method. This gives you
full access to the publisher, which can be used to create an Rx Flowable.

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_rx_example.event_stream.txt
  :dedent: 8
  :language: java

You can also use the :methodname:`publisherTransformer` method with the :methodname:`Flowable`
publisher. You must adapt the :methodname:`Flowable` publisher to an `SdkPublisher`, as shown in
the following example.

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.java2.stream_rx_example.publish_transform.txt
  :dedent: 8
  :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-kinesis:`complete example <KinesisStreamRxJavaEx.java>` on GitHub.
