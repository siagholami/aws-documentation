   :description: How to list metrics from Amazon CloudWatch using the AWS SDK for Java 2.x.

Listing metrics
===============

To list |cw| metrics, create a :aws-java-class:`ListMetricsRequest
<services/cloudwatch/model/ListMetricsRequest>` and call the |cwclient|'s :methodname:`listMetrics`
method. You can use the :classname:`ListMetricsRequest` to filter the returned metrics by namespace,
metric name, or dimensions.

.. note:: A list of metrics and dimensions that are posted by AWS services can be found within the
   :cw-ug:`Amazon CloudWatch Metrics and Dimensions Reference <CW_Support_For_AWS>` in the |cw-ug|.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch.java2.list_metrics.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch.java2.list_metrics.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

The metrics are returned in a :aws-java-class:`ListMetricsResponse
<services/cloudwatch/model/ListMetricsResponse>` by calling its :methodname:`getMetrics` method.

The results may be *paged*. To retrieve the next batch of results, call :methodname:`nextToken`
on the response object and use the token value to build a new request object. Then
call the :methodname:`listMetrics` method again with the new request.

See the :sdk-examples-java-cloudwatch:`complete example <ListMetrics.java>` on GitHub.
