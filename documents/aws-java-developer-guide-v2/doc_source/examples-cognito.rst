   :keywords: AWS for Java SDK code examples, cognito, user pool, app, client, identity, IdP,
              provider, credentials


With |COG|, you can quickly add user sign-up or sign-in capability to your web or mobile app. The
examples here demonstrate some of the basic functionality of Cognito.


.. _cognito-create-userpool:

Create a user pool
==================

A user pool is a directory of users that you can configure for your web or mobile app.

To create a user pool, start by building a
:aws-java-class:`CreateUserPoolRequest <services/cognitoidentityprovider/model/CreateUserPoolRequest>`
object, with the name of the user pool as the value of its :methodname:`poolName()`. Call the
:methodname:`createUserPool()` method of your
:aws-java-class:`CreateUserPoolRequest <services/cognitoidentityprovider/CognitoIdentityProviderClient>`,
passing in the :classname:`CreateUserPoolRequest` object. You can capture the result of this
request as a
:aws-java-class:`CreateUserPoolResponse <services/cognitoidentityprovider/model/CreateUserPoolResponse>`
object, as demonstrated in the following code snippet.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.create_user_pool.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.create_user_pool.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-cognito:`complete example <CreateUserPool.java>` on GitHub.


.. _cognito-list-userpool:

List users from a user pool
===========================

To list users from your user pools, start by building a
:aws-java-class:`ListUserPoolsRequest <services/cognitoidentityprovider/model/ListUserPoolsRequest>`
object, with the number of maximum results as the value of its :methodname:`maxResults()`.
Call the :methodname:`listUserPools()` method of your
:classname:`CognitoIdentityProviderClient`, passing in the :classname:`ListUserPoolsRequest`
object. You can capture the result of this request as a
:aws-java-class:`ListUserPoolsResponse <services/cognitoidentityprovider/model/ListUserPoolsResponse>`
object, as demonstrated in the following code snippet. Create a
:aws-java-class:`UserPoolDescriptionType <services/cognitoidentityprovider/model/UserPoolDescriptionType>`
object to easily iterate over the results and pull out the attributes of each user.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.ListUserPools.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.ListUserPools.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-cognito:`complete example <ListUserPools.java>` on GitHub.


.. _cognito-create-identitypool:

Create an identity pool
=======================

An identity pool is a container that organizes the IDs from your external identity provider,
keeping a unique identifier for each user. To create an identity pool, start by building a
:aws-java-class:`CreateIdentityPoolRequest <services/cognitoidentity/model/CreateIdentityPoolRequest>`
with the name of the user pool as the value of its :methodname:`identityPoolName()`. Set
:methodname:`allowUnauthenticatedIdentities()` to :code:`true` or :code:`false`. Call the
:methodname:`createIdentityPool()` method of your :classname:`CognitoIdentityClient` object,
passing in the :classname:`CreateIdentityPoolRequest` object. You can capture the result of this
request as a
:aws-java-class:`CreateIdentityPoolResponse <services/cognitoidentity/model/CreateIdentityPoolResponse>`
object, as demonstrated in the following code snippet.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.create_identity_pool.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.create_identity_pool.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-cognito:`complete example <CreateIdentityPool.java>` on GitHub.


.. _cognito-add-appclient:

Add an app client
=================

To enable the hosted web sign-up or sign-in UI for your app, create an app client. To create an app
client, start by building a
:aws-java-class:`CreateUserPoolClientRequest <services/cognitoidentityprovider/model/CreateUserPoolClientRequest>`
object, with the name of the client as the value of its :methodname:`clientName()`. Set
:methodname:`userPoolId()` to the ID of the user pool to which you want to attach this
app client. Call the :methodname:`createUserPoolClient()` method of your
:classname:`CognitoIdentityProviderClient`, passing in the :classname:`CreateUserPoolClientRequest`
object. You can capture the result of this request as a
:aws-java-class:`CreateUserPoolClientResponse <services/cognitoidentityprovider/model/CreateUserPoolClientResponse>`
object, as demonstrated in the following code snippet.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.user_pool.create_user_pool_client.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.user_pool.create_user_pool_client.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-cognito:`complete example <CreateUserPoolClient.java>` on GitHub.


.. _cognito-thirdparty-idp:

Add a third-party identity provider
===================================

Adding an external identity provider (IdP) enables your users to log into your app using that
serviceâ€™s login mechanism. To add a third-party IdP, start by building an
:aws-java-class:`UpdateIdentityPoolRequest <services/cognitoidentity/model/UpdateIdentityPoolRequest>`
object, with the name of the identity pool as the value of its :methodname:`identityPoolName()`.
Set :methodname:`allowUnauthenticatedIdentities()` to :code:`true` or :code:`false`, specify the
:methodname:`identityPoolId()`, and define which login providers will be supported with
:methodname:`supportedLoginProviders()`. Call the :methodname:`updateIdentityPool()`
method of your :classname:`CognitoIdentityClient`, passing in the
:classname:`UpdateIdentityPoolRequest` object. You can capture the result of this request as an
:aws-java-class:`UpdateIdentityPoolResponse <services/cognitoidentity/model/UpdateIdentityPoolResponse>`
object, as demonstrated in the following code snippet.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.add_login_provider.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.add_login_provider.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-cognito:`complete example <AddLoginProvider.java>` on GitHub.


.. _cognito-get-credentials:

Get credentials for an ID
=========================

To get the credentials for an identity in an identity pool, first build a
:aws-java-class:`GetCredentialsForIdentityRequest <services/cognitoidentity/model/GetCredentialsForIdentityRequest>`
with the identity ID as the value of its :methodname:`identityId()`. Call the
:methodname:`getCredentialsForIdentity()` method of your :classname:`CognitoIdentityClient`,
passing in the :classname:`GetCredentialsForIdentityRequest`. You can capture the result of this
request as a
:aws-java-class:`GetCredentialsForIdentityResponse <services/cognitoidentity/model/GetCredentialsForIdentityResponse>`
object, as demonstrated in the following code snippet.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.GetIdentityCredentials.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: cognito.java2.GetIdentityCredentials.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-cognito:`complete example <GetIdentityCredentials.java>` on GitHub.
