   :description: How to create, configure and delete EC2 security groups with the AWS SDK for Java 2.x.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Java 2.x, code examples, EC2 security groups, create a security group, ingress
              rules, egress rules, IP permissions, EC2 access


Create a security group
=======================

To create a security group, call the |ec2client|'s :methodname:`createSecurityGroup` method with a
:aws-java-class:`CreateSecurityGroupRequest <services/ec2/model/CreateSecurityGroupRequest>` that
contains the key's name.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: ec2.java2.create_security_group.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: ec2.java2.create_security_group.create.txt
   :dedent: 8
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-ec2:`complete example <CreateSecurityGroup.java>` on GitHub.


Configure a security group
==========================

A security group can control both inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) traffic to your |EC2|
instances.

To add ingress rules to your security group, use the |ec2client|'s
:methodname:`authorizeSecurityGroupIngress` method, providing the name of the security group and the
access rules (:aws-java-class:`IpPermission <services/ec2/model/IpPermission>`) you want to assign
to it within an :aws-java-class:`AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngressRequest
<services/ec2/model/AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngressRequest>` object. The following example shows how
to add IP permissions to a security group.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: ec2.java2.create_security_group.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

First, create an |ec2client|

.. literalinclude:: ec2.java2.create_security_group.client.txt
   :dedent: 8
   :language: java

Then use the |ec2client|'s :methodname:`authorizeSecurityGroupIngress` method,

.. literalinclude:: ec2.java2.create_security_group.config.txt
   :dedent: 8
   :language: java

To add an egress rule to the security group, provide similar data in an
:aws-java-class:`AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgressRequest
<services/ec2/model/AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgressRequest>` to the |ec2client|'s
:methodname:`authorizeSecurityGroupEgress` method.

See the :sdk-examples-java-ec2:`complete example <CreateSecurityGroup.java>` on GitHub.


Describe security groups
========================

To describe your security groups or get information about them, call the |ec2client|'s
:methodname:`describeSecurityGroups` method. It returns a
:aws-java-class:`DescribeSecurityGroupsResponse <services/ec2/model/DescribeSecurityGroupsResponse>`
that you can use to access the list of security groups by calling its
:methodname:`securityGroups` method, which returns a list of :aws-java-class:`SecurityGroup
<services/ec2/model/SecurityGroup>` objects.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: ec2.java2.describe_security_groups.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: ec2.java2.describe_security_groups.main.txt
   :dedent: 5
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-ec2:`complete example <DescribeSecurityGroups.java>` on GitHub.


Delete a security group
=======================

To delete a security group, call the |ec2client|'s :methodname:`deleteSecurityGroup` method, passing
it a :aws-java-class:`DeleteSecurityGroupRequest <services/ec2/model/DeleteSecurityGroupRequest>`
that contains the ID of the security group to delete.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: ec2.java2.delete_security_group.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: ec2.java2.delete_security_group.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-ec2:`complete example <DeleteSecurityGroup.java>` on GitHub.
