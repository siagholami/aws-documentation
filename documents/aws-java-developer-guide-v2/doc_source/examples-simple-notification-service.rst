   :description: How to use the AWS SDK for Java to work with Amazon Simple Notification Service
                 (SNS).

              publish, message, unsubscribe

With |SNSlong|, you can easily push real-time notification messages from your applications to
subscribers over multiple communication channels. This topic describes how to perform some of the
basic functions of SNS.


.. _sns-create-topic:

Create a topic
==============

A **topic** is a logical grouping of communication channels that defines which systems to send a message
to, for example, fanning out a message to |LAMlong| and an HTTP webhook. You send messages to
|SNS|, then they're distributed to the channels defined in the topic. This makes the messages
available to subscribers.

To create a topic, first build a
:aws-java-class:`CreateTopicRequest <services/sns/model/CreateTopicRequest>` object, with the name
of the topic set using the :methodname:`name()` method in the builder. Then, send the request
object to |SNS| by using the :methodname:`createTopic()` method of the :aws-java-class:`SnsClient <services/sns/SnsClient>`. 
You can capture the result of this request as a
:aws-java-class:`CreateTopicResponse <services/sns/model/CreateTopicResponse>` object, as
demonstrated in the following code snippet.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.CreateTopic.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.CreateTopic.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-sns:`complete example <CreateTopic.java>` on GitHub.


.. _sns-crelistate-topics:

List your SNS topics
====================

To retrieve a list of your existing |SNS| topics, build a
:aws-java-class:`ListTopicsRequest <services/sns/model/ListTopicsRequest>` object. Then, send the
request object to |SNS| by using the :methodname:`listTopics()` method of the :classname:`SnsClient`. You can
capture the result of this request as a
:aws-java-class:`ListTopicsResponse <services/sns/model/ListTopicsResponse>` object.

The following code snippet prints out the HTTP status code of the request and a list of
Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for your |SNS| topics.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.ListTopics.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.ListTopics.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-sns:`complete example <ListTopics.java>` on GitHub.


.. _sns-subscribe-endpoint-topic:

Subscribe an endpoint to a topic
================================

After you create a topic, you can configure which communication channels will be endpoints for
that topic. Messages are distributed to these endpoints after |SNS| receives them.

To configure a communication channel as an endpoint for a topic, subscribe that endpoint to the
topic. To start, build a :aws-java-class:`SubscribeRequest <services/sns/model/SubscribeRequest>`
object. Specify the communication channel (for example, :code:`lambda` or :code:`email`) as the
:methodname:`protocol()`. Set the :methodname:`endpoint()` to the relevant output location (for
example, the ARN of a |LAM| function or an email address), and then set the ARN of the
topic to which you want to subscribe as the :methodname:`topicArn()`. Send the request object
to SNS by using the :methodname:`subscribe()` method of the :classname:`SnsClient`. You can capture the result
of this request as a :aws-java-class:`SubscribeResponse <services/sns/model/SubscribeResponse>`
object.

The following code snippet shows how to subscribe an email address to a topic.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.SubscribeEmail.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.SubscribeEmail.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-sns:`complete example <SubscribeEmail.java>` on GitHub.


.. _sns-publish-message-topic:

Publish a message to a topic
============================

After you have a topic and one or more endpoints configured for it, you can publish a message to
it. To start, build a :aws-java-class:`PublishRequest <services/sns/model/PublishRequest>`
object. Specify the :methodname:`message()` to send, and the ARN of the topic (:methodname:`topicArn()`)
to send it to. Then, send the request object to |SNS| by using
the :methodname:`publish()` method of the :classname:`SnsClient`. You can capture the result of this request
as a :aws-java-class:`PublishResponse <services/sns/model/PublishResponse>` object.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.PublishTopic.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.PublishTopic.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-sns:`complete example <PublishTopic.java>` on GitHub.


.. _sns-unsubscribe-endpoint-topic:

Unsubscribe an endpoint from a topic
====================================

You can remove the communication channels configured as endpoints for a topic. After doing that, the
topic itself continues to exist and distribute messages to any other endpoints configured for
that topic.

To remove a communication channel as an endpoint for a topic, unsubscribe that endpoint from the
topic. To start, build an
:aws-java-class:`UnsubscribeRequest <services/sns/model/UnsubscribeRequest>` object and set the
ARN of the topic you want to unsubscribe from as the :methodname:`subscriptionArn()`. Then
send the request object to SNS by using the :methodname:`unsubscribe()` method of the :classname:`SnsClient`.
You can capture the result of this request as an
:aws-java-class:`UnsubscribeResponse <services/sns/model/UnsubscribeResponse>` object.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.Unsubscribe.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.Unsubscribe.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-sns:`complete example <Unsubscribe.java>` on GitHub.


.. _sns-delete-topic:

Delete a topic
==============

To delete an |SNS| topic, first build a
:aws-java-class:`DeleteTopicRequest <services/sns/model/DeleteTopicRequest>` object with the
ARN of the topic set as the :methodname:`topicArn()` method in the builder. Then send the
request object to |SNS| by using the :methodname:`deleteTopic()` method of the :classname:`SnsClient`. You can
capture the result of this request as a
:aws-java-class:`DeleteTopicResponse <services/sns/model/DeleteTopicResponse>` object, as
demonstrated in the following code snippet.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.DeleteTopic.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: sns.java2.DeleteTopic.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-sns:`complete example <DeleteTopic.java>` on GitHub.
