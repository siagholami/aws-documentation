   :description: How to use the DynamoDB enhanced client to map client-side items to records in
                 DynamoDB tables.
   :keywords: AWS for Java SDK code examples, enhanced client, object mapper, get items from
              DynamoDB tables


The |DDBlong| enhanced client is a high-level library that is part of the |sdk-java| version 2
(v2). It offers a straightforward way to map client-side classes to |DDB| tables. You define the
relationships between tables and their corresponding model classes in your code. Then you can
intuitively perform various create, read, update, or delete (CRUD) operations on tables or items
in |DDB|.

The |sdk-java| v2 includes a set of annotations that you can use with a Java bean to quickly
generate a :aws-java-class:`TableSchema <enhanced/dynamodb/TableSchema>` for mapping your classes
to tables. Alternatively, if you declare each
:aws-java-class:`TableSchema <enhanced/dynamodb/TableSchema>` explicitly, you don't need to include
annotations in your classes.

To work with items in a |DDB| table using the enhanced client, first create a
:aws-java-class:`DynamoDbEnhancedClient <enhanced/dynamodb/DynamoDbEnhancedClient>` from an existing
:aws-java-class:`DynamoDbClient <services/dynamodb/DynamoDbClient>` object.

.. code-block:: java

    Region region = Region.US_EAST_1;
    DynamoDbClient ddb = DynamoDbClient.builder()
            .region(region)
            .build();

    DynamoDbEnhancedClient enhancedClient = DynamoDbEnhancedClient.builder()
            .dynamoDbClient(ddb)
            .build();

    createDynamoDBTable(enhancedClient);


.. _dynamodb-enhanced-mapper-beantable:

Create a table using the enhanced client
========================================

To easily create a :aws-java-class:`TableSchema <enhanced/dynamodb/TableSchema>` using the enhanced
client, start by creating a Java data class that includes a default public constructor and
standardized names of getters and setters for each property in the class. Include a class-level
annotation to indicate it is a :classname:`DynamoDbBean` and, at a minimum, include a
:classname:`DynamoDbPartitionKey` annotation on the getter or setter for the primary key of the
table record.

Once this data class has been defined, call
:aws-java-class:`TableSchema <enhanced/dynamodb/TableSchema>`'s :methodname:`fromBean()` with that
data class to create the table schema.

See the code snippet below for an example of how to do this.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.java2.mapping.putitem.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.java2.mapping.putitem.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-dynamodb:`complete example <EnhancedPutItem.java>` on GitHub.


.. _dynamodb-enhanced-mapper-getitem:

Retrieve (get) an item from a table
===================================

To get an item from a |DDB| table, create a
:aws-java-class:`DynamoDbTable <enhanced/dynamodb/DynamoDbTable>` object and call
:methodname:`getItem()` with a
:aws-java-class:`GetItemEnhancedRequest <enhanced/dynamodb/model/GetItemEnhancedRequest>` object to
get the actual item.

For example, the following code snippet demonstrates one way to use the enhanced client to get
information from an item in a |DDB| table.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.java2.mapping.getitem.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.java2.mapping.getitem.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-dynamodb:`complete example <EnhancedGetItem.java>` on GitHub.


.. _dynamodb-enhanced-mapper-batchitems:

Batch create (put) and delete items
===================================

You can batch a series of put requests
(:aws-java-class:`PutItemEnhancedRequest <enhanced/dynamodb/model/PutItemEnhancedRequest>`) and
delete requests
(:aws-java-class:`DeleteItemEnhancedRequest <enhanced/dynamodb/model/DeleteItemEnhancedRequest>`) to
one or more tables, and then send all of the changes in a single request.

In the following code snippet, a :aws-java-class:`DynamoDbTable <enhanced/dynamodb/DynamoDbTable>`
object is created, two items are queued up to be added to the table, and then the items are written
to the table in a single call. Include multiple entries of :methodname:`addDeleteItem()` and
:methodname:`addPutItem()`
(:aws-java-class:`part of WriteBatch.Builder <enhanced/dynamodb/model/WriteBatch.Builder>`) in each
batch, as needed. To queue up changes to a different table, add another instance of
:methodname:`WriteBatch.builder()` and provide a corresponding
:aws-java-class:`DynamoDbTable <enhanced/dynamodb/DynamoDbTable>` object in
:methodname:`mappedTableResource()`.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.java2.mapping.batchitems.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.java2.mapping.batchitems.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-dynamodb:`complete example <EnhancedBatchWriteItems.java>` on GitHub.


.. _dynamodb-enhanced-mapper-queryfilter:

Use a filtered query to get items from a table
==============================================

You can get items from a table based on filterable queries, and then perform operations (for
example, return item values) on one or more of the items in the query results.

In the following code snippet, you build a filter by first defining the value or values you're
searching for as an :aws-java-class:`AttributeValue <services/dynamodb/model/AttributeValue>`
object. Then you put this into a :classname:`HashMap` and build an
:aws-java-class:`Expression <enhanced/dynamodb/Expression>` from the classname:HashMap. Build a
:aws-java-class:`QueryConditional <enhanced/dynamodb/model/QueryConditional>` object to specify the
primary key to match against in the query, and then execute the query on your
:aws-java-class:`DynamoDbTable <enhanced/dynamodb/DynamoDbTable>` object.

.. note::

   The :aws-java-class:`QueryConditional <enhanced/dynamodb/model/QueryConditional>` interface has
   several methods you can use to build your queries, including common conditional statements like
   greater than, less than, and in between.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.java2.mapping.queryfilter.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.java2.mapping.queryfilter.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-dynamodb:`complete example <EnhancedQueryRecordsWithFilter.java>` on GitHub.


.. _dynamodb-enhanced-mapper-scan:

Retrieve (get) all items from a table
=====================================

When you want to get all of the records in a given |DDB| table, use the :methodname:`scan()` method
of your :aws-java-class:`DynamoDbTable <enhanced/dynamodb/DynamoDbTable>` object and the
:methodname:`items()` method to create a set of results against which you can execute various item
operations. For example, the following code snippet prints out the ID value of each item in the
**Record** table.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.java2.mapping.scan.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: dynamodb.java2.mapping.scan.main.txt
