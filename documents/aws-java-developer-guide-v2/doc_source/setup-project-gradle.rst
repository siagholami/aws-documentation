   :description:  How to use Gradle to set up your AWS SDK for Java v2 project
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Java, v2, Gradle, BOM, install, download, setup


You can use Gradle_ to configure and build AWS SDK for Java projects.

To manage SDK dependencies for your Gradle project, import the Maven bill of materials (BOM) for
the |sdk-java| into the :file:`build.gradle` file.

.. note:: In the following examples, replace *2.X.X* in the :file:`build.gradle` file with a valid
          version of the AWS SDK for Java v2. Find the latest version in the
          :aws-java-class-root:`AWS SDK for Java API Reference version 2.x<>`.

.. topic:: To configure the |sdk-java| for Gradle version 5.0 or later
    
    #. Add the BOM to the `dependencies` section of the file.

       .. code-block:: groovy

          ...
          dependencies {
            implementation platform('software.amazon.awssdk:bom:2.X.X')

            // Declare individual SDK dependencies without version
            ...
          } 
          

    #. Specify the SDK modules to use in the `dependencies` section. For example, the following
       includes a dependency for |AKlong|.

       .. code-block:: groovy

          ...
          dependencies {
            ...
            implementation 'software.amazon.awssdk:kinesis'
            ...
          }
          

Gradle automatically resolves the correct version of your SDK dependencies by using the information
from the BOM.

The following is an example of a complete :file:`build.gradle` file that includes a dependency for
|AK|.

.. code-block:: groovy

   group 'aws.test'
   version '1.0'

   apply plugin: 'java'

   sourceCompatibility = 1.8

   repositories {
     mavenCentral()
   }

   dependencies {
     implementation platform('software.amazon.awssdk:bom:2.X.X')
     implementation 'software.amazon.awssdk:kinesis'
     testImplementation group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.11'
   }
   

.. note:: In the previous example, replace the dependency for |AK| with the dependencies of the AWS
          services you will use in your project. The modules (dependencies) that are managed by the
          |sdk-java| BOM are listed on Maven central repository
          (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/bom/latest).

For more information about specifying SDK dependencies by using the BOM, see
:doc:`setup-project-maven`.
