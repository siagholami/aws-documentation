   :description: How to create, list, and delete alarms in Amazon CloudWatch using the AWS SDK for
                 Java 2.x
   :keywords: create alarm, delete alarm, list alarms, metric alarms, AWS SDK for Java 2.x, example code

Create an alarm
===============

To create an alarm based on a |cw| metric, call the |cwclient|'s :methodname:`putMetricAlarm` method
with a :aws-java-class:`PutMetricAlarmRequest <services/cloudwatch/model/PutMetricAlarmRequest>`
filled with the alarm conditions.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch.java2.put_metric_alarm.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch.java2.put_metric_alarm.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-cloudwatch:`complete example <PutMetricAlarm.java>` on GitHub.

List alarms
===========

To list the |cw| alarms that you have created, call the |cwclient|'s :methodname:`describeAlarms`
method with a :aws-java-class:`DescribeAlarmsRequest
<services/cloudwatch/model/DescribeAlarmsRequest>` that you can use to set options for the result.


**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch.java2.describe_alarms.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch.java2.describe_alarms.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java

The list of alarms can be obtained by calling :methodname:`MetricAlarms` on the
:aws-java-class:`DescribeAlarmsResponse <services/cloudwatch/model/DescribeAlarmsResponse>` that is
returned by :methodname:`describeAlarms`.

The results may be *paged*. To retrieve the next batch of results, call :methodname:`nextToken`
on the response object and use the token value to build a new request object. Then
call the :methodname:`describeAlarms` method again with the new request.

.. tip:: You can also retrieve alarms for a specific metric by using the |cwclient|'s
   :methodname:`describeAlarmsForMetric` method. Its use is similar to :methodname:`describeAlarms`.

See the :sdk-examples-java-cloudwatch:`complete example <DescribeAlarms.java>` on GitHub.

Delete alarms
=============

To delete |cw| alarms, call the |cwclient|'s :methodname:`deleteAlarms` method with a
:aws-java-class:`DeleteAlarmsRequest <services/cloudwatch/model/DeleteAlarmsRequest>` containing one
or more names of alarms that you want to delete.


**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch.java2.delete_metrics.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: cloudwatch.java2.delete_metrics.main.txt
   :dedent: 4
   :language: java


See the :sdk-examples-java-cloudwatch:`complete example <DeleteAlarm.java>` on GitHub.
