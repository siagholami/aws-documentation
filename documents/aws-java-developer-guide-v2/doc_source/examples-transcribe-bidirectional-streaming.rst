   :description: How to set up bidirectional streaming using Amazon Transcribe.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for Java 2.x code examples, Transcribe streaming


The following example shows how bidirectional streaming works using |TSC|.
Bidirectional streaming implies that there's both a stream of data going to the service
and being received back in real time. The example uses |TSC| streaming transcription
to send an audio stream and receive a stream of transcribed text back in real time.

See :TSC-dg:`Streaming Transcription <streaming>` in the |TSC-dg| to learn more about
this feature.

See :TSC-dg:`Getting Started <getting-started>` in the |TSC-dg| to get started using
|TSC|.

Set up the Microphone
=====================

This code uses the javax.sound.sampled package to stream audio from an input device.

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: transcribe.java2.bidir_streaming_microphone.complete.txt
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-transcribe:`complete example <Microphone.java>` on GitHub.

Create a Publisher
==================

This code implements a publisher that publishes audio data from the |TSC| audio stream.

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: transcribe.java2.bidir_streaming_audiopublisher.complete.txt
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-transcribe:`complete example <AudioStreamPublisher.java>` on GitHub.


Create the Client and Start the Stream
======================================

In the main method, create a request object, start the audio input stream and instantiate
the publisher with the audio input.

You must also create a
:aws-java-class:`StartStreamTranscriptionResponseHandler <services/transcribestreaming/model/StartStreamTranscriptionResponseHandler>`
to specify how to handle the response from |TSC|.

Then, use the |tscstreamasyncclient|'s
:methodname:`startStreamTranscription` method to start the bidirectional streaming.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: transcribe.java2.bidir_streaming.import.txt
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: transcribe.java2.bidir_streaming.main.txt
   :dedent: 2
   :language: java

See the :sdk-examples-java-transcribe:`complete example <BidirectionalStreaming.java>` on GitHub.
