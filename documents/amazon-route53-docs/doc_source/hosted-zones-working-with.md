# Working with hosted zones<a name="hosted-zones-working-with"></a>

A hosted zone is a container for records, and records contain information about how you want to route traffic for a specific domain, such as example\.com, and its subdomains \(acme\.example\.com, zenith\.example\.com\)\. A hosted zone and the corresponding domain have the same name\. There are two types of hosted zones:
+ *Public hosted zones* contain records that specify how you want to route traffic on the internet\. For more information, see [Working with public hosted zones](AboutHZWorkingWith.md)\.
+ *Private hosted zones* contain records that specify how you want to route traffic in an Amazon VPC\. For more information, see [Working with private hosted zones](hosted-zones-private.md)\.
