# Monitoring domain registrations<a name="monitoring-domain-registrations"></a>

The Amazon Route 53 dashboard provides detailed information about the status of your domain registrations, including the following:
+ Status of new domain registrations
+ Status of domain transfers to Route 53
+ List of domains that are approaching the expiration date

We recommend that you periodically check the dashboard in the Route 53 console, especially after you register a new domain or transfer a domain to Route 53, to confirm that there are no issues for you to address\. 

We also recommend that you confirm that the contact information for your domains is up to date\. As the expiration date for a domain approaches, we email the registrant contact for the domain with information about when the domain expires and how to renew\.
