# AWS Identity and Access Management<a name="IAMRoute53"></a>

Amazon Route 53 integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\), a service that lets your organization do the following:
+ Create users and groups under your organization's AWS account
+ Easily share your AWS account resources among the users in the account
+ Assign unique security credentials to each user
+ Granularly control user access to services and resources

For example, you can use IAM with Route 53 to control which users in your AWS account can create a new hosted zone or change records\.
