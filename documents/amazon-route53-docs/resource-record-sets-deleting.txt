Deleting records
The following procedure explains how to delete records using the Route 53 console. For information about how to delete records using the Route 53 API, see ChangeResourceRecordSets in the Amazon Route 53 API Reference.
Note
Your changes to records take time to propagate to the Route 53 DNS servers. Currently, the only way to verify that changes have propagated is to use the GetChange API action. Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds.
To delete records


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/.


On the Hosted Zones page, choose the row for the hosted zone that contains records that you want to delete. 


In the list of records, select the record that you want to delete.


To select multiple, consecutive records, choose the first row, hold the Shift key, and choose the last row. To select multiple, nonconsecutive records, choose the first row, hold the Ctrl key, and choose additional rows. 
You can't delete the records that have a value of NS or SOA for Type.


Choose Delete Record Set.


Choose OK to confirm.
