Deleting health checks
To delete health checks, perform the following procedure.
Note
If you're using AWS Cloud Map and you configured AWS Cloud Map to create a Route 53 health check when you register an instance, you can't use the Route 53 console to delete the health check. The health check is deleted automatically when you deregister the instance. There can be a delay of several hours before the health check no longer appears in the Route 53 console.
