Migrating to Amazon MQ with Service Interruption
The following diagrams illustrate the scenario of migrating from an on-premises message broker to an Amazon MQ broker in the AWS Cloud with service interruption.
Important
This scenario requires you to point your producer to your Amazon MQ broker's endpoint before you do the same for your consumers. This sequence ensures that any messages in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) queue maintain their order during the migration process. If you're not concerned about message ordering, follow the steps in Migrating to Amazon MQ without Service Interruption.

Migration to Amazon MQ with FIFO (Ordered) Queues









To migrate to Amazon MQ with service interruption
 Create and configure an Amazon MQ broker and note your broker's endpoint, for example:
ssl://b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:61617
 Stop your existing producer, point the producer to your Amazon MQ broker's endpoint, and then restart the producer.
Important
This step requires an interruption of your application's functionality because no consumers are yet consuming messages from the Amazon MQ broker.
 Wait for your consumers to drain the destinations on your on-premises broker.
 Do one of the following:
 One by one, point each existing consumer to your Amazon MQ broker's endpoint.
 Create new consumers and point them to your Amazon MQ broker's endpoint.
Note
If you scale up your consumer fleet during the migration process, it is a best practice to scale it down afterward.
 Stop your on-premises broker.
