Monitoring Amazon MQ Brokers Using Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon MQ and Amazon CloudWatch are integrated so you can use CloudWatch to view and analyze metrics for your ActiveMQ broker and the broker's destinations (queues and topics). You can view and analyze your Amazon MQ metrics from the CloudWatch console, the AWS CLI, or the CloudWatch CLI. CloudWatch metrics for Amazon MQ are automatically polled from the broker and then pushed to CloudWatch every minute.
For information, see Tutorial: Accessing CloudWatch Metrics for Amazon MQ.
Note
The following statistics are valid for all of the metrics:
Average
Minimum
Maximum
Sum
The AWS/AmazonMQ namespace includes the following metrics.
Broker Metrics



Metric
Unit
Description




BurstBalance
Percent
The percentage of burst credits remaining on the Amazon EBS volume used to persist message data for throughput-optimized brokers. If this balance reaches zero, the IOPS provided by the Amazon EBS volume will decrease until the Burst Balance refills. For more information on how Burst Balances work in Amazon EBS, see: I/O Credits and Burst Performance.


CpuCreditBalance
Credits (vCPU-minutes)
This metric is available only for the mq.t2.micro broker instance type. CPU credit metrics are available only at five-minute intervals.  The number of earned CPU credits that an instance has accrued since it was launched or started (including the number of launch credits). The credit balance is available for the broker instance to spend on bursts beyond the baseline CPU utilization. Credits are accrued in the credit balance after they're earned and removed from the credit balance after they're spent. The credit balance has a maximum limit. Once the limit is reached, any newly earned credits are discarded.


CpuUtilization
Percent
The percentage of allocated Amazon EC2 compute units that the broker currently uses.


CurrentConnectionsCount
Count
The current number of active connections on the current broker.


EstablishedConnectionsCount
Count
The total number of connections, active and inactive, that have been established on the broker.


HeapUsage
Percent
The percentage of the ActiveMQ JVM memory limit that the broker currently uses.


InactiveDurableTopicSubscribersCount
Count
The number of inactive durable topic subscribers, up to a maximum of 2000.


JobSchedulerStorePercentUsage
Percent
The percentage of disk space used by the job scheduler store.


JournalFilesForFastRecovery
Count
The number of journal files that will be replayed after a clean shutdown.


JournalFilesForFullRecovery
Count
The number of journal files that will be replayed after an unclean shutdown.


NetworkIn
Bytes
The volume of incoming traffic for the broker.


NetworkOut
Bytes
The volume of outgoing traffic for the broker.


OpenTransactionCount
Count
The total number of transactions in progress.


StorePercentUsage
Percent
The percent used by the storage limit. If this reaches 100, the broker will refuse messages.


TempPercentUsage
Percent
The percentage of available temporary storage used by non-persistent messages.


TotalConsumerCount
Count
The number of message consumers subscribed to destinations on the current broker.


TotalMessageCount
Count
The number of messages stored on the broker.


TotalProducerCount
Count
The number of message producers active on destinations on the current broker.


VolumeReadOps
Count
The number of read operations performed on the Amazon EBS volume.


VolumeWriteOps
Count
The number of write operations performed on the Amazon EBS volume.



Dimension for Broker Metrics



Dimension
Description




Broker
The name of the broker.  A single-instance broker has the suffix -1. An active/standby broker for high availability has the suffixes -1 and -2 for its redundant pair.



Destination (Queue and Topic) Metrics
Important
The following metrics include per-minute counts for the CloudWatch polling period.
EnqueueCount
ExpiredCount
DequeueCount
DispatchCount
InFlightCount
For example, in a five-minute CloudWatch period, EnqueueCount has five count values, each for a one-minute portion of the period. The Minimum and Maximum statistics provide the lowest and highest per-minute value during the specified period.



Metric
Unit
Description




ConsumerCount
Count
The number of consumers subscribed to the destination.


EnqueueCount
Count
The number of messages sent to the destination, per minute.


EnqueueTime
Time (milliseconds)
The end-to-end latency from when a message arrives at a broker until it is delivered to a consumer.


ExpiredCount
Count
The number of messages that couldn't be delivered because they expired, per minute.


DispatchCount
Count
The number of messages sent to consumers, per minute.


DequeueCount
Count
The number of messages acknowledged by consumers, per minute.


InFlightCount
Count
The number of messages sent to consumers that have not been acknowledged.


ReceiveCount
Count
The number of messages that have been received from the remote broker for a duplex network connector.


MemoryUsage
Percent
The percentage of the memory limit that the destination currently uses.


ProducerCount
Count
The number of producers for the destination.


QueueSize
Count
The number of messages in the queue. This metric applies only to queues.


TotalEnqueueCount
Count
The total number of messages that have been sent to the broker.


TotalDequeueCount
Count
The total number of messages that have been consumed by clients.



Note
TotalEnqueueCount and TotalDequeueCount metrics include messages for advisory topics. For more information about advisory topic messages, see the ActiveMQ documentation.
