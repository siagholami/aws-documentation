AWS Encryption SDK programming languages
The AWS Encryption SDK is available for the following programming languages. All language implementations are interoperable. You can encrypt with one language implementation and decrypt with another. Interoperability might be subject to language constraints. If so, these constraints are described in the topic about the language implementation. Also, when encrypting and decrypting, you must use compatible keyrings, or master keys and master key providers. For details, see Keyring compatibility.
