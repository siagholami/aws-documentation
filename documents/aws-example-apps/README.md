# Example apps

AWS provides example apps for you to experiment with as you learn how to automate AWS services with code. These apps include:

- Scripts to run in your AWS account to create the apps' required AWS resources. These include required resources such as Amazon DynamoDB tables, AWS Lambda functions, Amazon Cognito user pools, and AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) resource access policies. 
- Client code that demonstrates how to use the AWS SDKs to interact with AWS services. You should be able to run this code on your local workstation with few or no modifications. 

THESE EXAMPLE APPS ARE FOR LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT USE THESE EXAMPLE APPS IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.

## About the apps ##

We are currently working on the code for just one example app. You can find the app code in the following subfolder of this repo. We expect to add more apps in the coming months.

- `chat-app`: An online chat app. This app features a single chat room and supports multiple participants. It uses Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, Amazon Cognito, and AWS IAM.
