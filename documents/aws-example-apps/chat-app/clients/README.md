# Chat app clients

Experiment with this example chat app to learn how to write code for your AWS applications.

This app features a single chat room and supports multiple participants. It allows participants to sign up and sign in to the chat room as well as read and add posts in the chat room. It uses Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, Amazon Cognito, and AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM).

THIS EXAMPLE APP IS FOR LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT USE THIS EXAMPLE APP IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.

## Scripts for the app ##

Find the app's scripts one level up in the `setup` subfolder. You can run these scripts in your AWS account to create the app's required AWS resources. These include resources 
such as Amazon DynamoDB tables, AWS Lambda functions, Amazon Cognito user pools, and AWS IAM resource access policies. After you create the app's required AWS resources, you should be able to run the app's code on your local workstation with few or no modifications. 

We are currently working on app code for the Microsoft .NET Framework, Go, and Ruby. We expect to add app code for more programming languages in the coming months.

Find the code in the following subfolders:

- `cpp`: Client code that uses the AWS SDK for C++.
- `dotnet`: Client code that uses the AWS SDK for .NET.
- `go`: Client code that uses the AWS SDK for Go.
- `java`: Client code that uses the AWS SDK for Java.
- `javascript`: Client code that uses the AWS SDK for JavaScript.
- `php`: Client code that uses the AWS SDK for PHP.
- `python`: Client code that uses the AWS SDK for Python (Boto 3).
- `ruby`: Client code that uses the AWS SDK for Ruby.
