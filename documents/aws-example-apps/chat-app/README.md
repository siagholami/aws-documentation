# Chat app

Experiment with this example chat app to learn how to write code for your AWS applications.

This app features a single chat room and supports multiple participants. It allows participants to sign up and sign in to the chat room as well as read and add posts in the chat room. It uses Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, Amazon Cognito, and AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM).

THIS EXAMPLE APP IS FOR LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT USE THIS EXAMPLE APP IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.

## About the app ##

This app includes scripts you can run in your AWS account to create the app's required AWS resources. These include resources such as Amazon DynamoDB tables, AWS Lambda functions, Amazon Cognito user pools, and AWS IAM resource access policies. These scripts are in the `setup` subfolder.

After you create the app's required AWS resources, you should be able to run the app's code on your local workstation with few or no modifications. The code is in the `clients` subfolder, organized by programming language.
