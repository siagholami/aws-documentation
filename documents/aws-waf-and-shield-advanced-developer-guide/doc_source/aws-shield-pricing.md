# AWS Shield pricing<a name="aws-shield-pricing"></a>

AWS Shield Standard is included with your AWS services at no additional cost\.

AWS Shield Advanced pricing is detailed on the [AWS Shield Advanced Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/shield/pricing/) page\. AWS Shield Advanced does have an additional cost, but AWS Shield Advanced customers do not pay for AWS WAF separately for resources that they protect with AWS Shield Advanced\. Protection for those resources is included as part of the AWS Shield Advanced service\. Further, AWS Shield Advanced charges do not increase with attack volume\. This provides a predictable cost for the extended protection\.

The AWS Shield Advanced fee applies for each business that is subscribed to AWS Shield Advanced\. If your business has multiple AWS accounts, you pay just one Shield Advanced monthly fee as long as all the AWS accounts are in the same [Consolidated Billing account family](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html)\. Further, you must own all the AWS accounts and resources in the account\. 

However, AWS Channel Resellers will pay a separate monthly fee for each member account\. AWS Channel Resellers who resell AWS Shield Advanced to customers with more than one member account may [contact us](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/) for additional billing support\. With respect to such AWS Channel Resellers, AWS reserves the right to modify the monthly fee for AWS Shield Advanced\.
