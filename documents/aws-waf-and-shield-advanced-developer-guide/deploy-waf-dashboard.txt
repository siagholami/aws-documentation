Step 6: Create a DDoS Dashboard in CloudWatch and Set CloudWatch Alarms
You can monitor potential DDoS activity using CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from Shield Advanced into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing. For more information, see What is CloudWatch in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
For instructions for creating a CloudWatch dashboard, see Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch. For information about specific Shield Advanced metrics that you can add to your dashboard, see AWS Shield Advanced metrics and alarms. 
As a final step for getting started with Shield Advanced, review the global threat dashboard, as described in Step 7: Monitor the global threat dashboard .
