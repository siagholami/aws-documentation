Deleting a Web ACL
Note
This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. You should only use this version if you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November 2019, and you have not migrated them over to the latest version yet. To migrate your resources, see Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF .
For the latest version of AWS WAF, see AWS WAF. 
To delete a web ACL, you must remove the rules that are included in the web ACL and disassociate all CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers from the web ACL. Perform the following procedure.
To delete a web ACL


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/. 


In the navigation pane, choose Web ACLs.


Choose the web ACL that you want to delete.


On the Rules tab in the right pane, choose Edit web ACL.


To remove all rules from the web ACL, choose the x at the right of the row for each rule. This doesn't delete the rules from AWS WAF Classic, it just removes the rules from this web ACL.


Choose Update.


Disassociate the web ACL from all CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. On the Rules tab, under AWS resources using this web ACL, choose the x for each API Gateway API, CloudFront distribution or Application Load Balancer.


On the Web ACLs page, confirm that the web ACL that you want to delete is selected, and then choose Delete.
