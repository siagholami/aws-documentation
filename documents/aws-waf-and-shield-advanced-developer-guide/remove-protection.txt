Removing AWS Shield Advanced protection from an AWS resource
You can remove AWS Shield Advanced protection from any of your AWS resources at any time. 
Important
Deleting an AWS resource doesn't remove the resource from AWS Shield Advanced. You must also remove the protection on the resource from AWS Shield Advanced, as described in this procedure.
Note
The console guidance provided here is for the latest version of the AWS Shield console, released in 2020. In the console, you can switch between versions. 
Remove AWS Shield Advanced protection from an AWS resource


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF & Shield console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/. 


Choose Protected resources.


Select the resources whose protections you want to remove. 


Choose Delete protections.


If you have an Amazon CloudWatch alarm configured for a protection, you are given the option to delete the alarm along with the protection. If you choose not to delete the alarm at this point, you can instead delete it later using the CloudWatch console.
Note
For protections that have an Amazon RouteÂ 53 health check configured, if you add the protection again later, the protection still includes the health check. 


The preceding steps remove AWS Shield Advanced protection from specific AWS resources. They don't cancel your AWS Shield Advanced subscription. You will continue to be charged for the service. For information about your AWS Shield Advanced subscription, contact the AWS Support Center.
