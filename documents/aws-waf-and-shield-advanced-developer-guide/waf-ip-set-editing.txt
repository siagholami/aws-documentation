Editing an IP set
To add or remove IP addresses or IP address ranges from an IP set or change its description, perform the following procedure. 
To edit an IP set


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/. 


In the navigation pane, choose IP sets.


Select the IP set that you want to edit and choose Edit.


Modify the IP version and addresses as needed. In the IP addresses text box, you must have one IP address or IP address range per line, in CIDR notation. AWS WAF supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges except for /0. For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia article Classless Inter-Domain Routing. For addresses, enter one IP address or IP address range per line, in CIDR notation.
