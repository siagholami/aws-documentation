Rule group statement
The rule group rule statement adds a reference to your web ACL rules list to a rule group that you manage. You don't see this option under your rule statements on the console, but when you work with the JSON format of your web ACL, any of your own rule groups that you've added show up under the web ACL rules as this type. For information about using your own rule groups, see Managing your own rule groups.
When you add a rule group to a web ACL, you can exclude individual rules in the group from running, and you can override the actions of all rules in the rule group, to count only. For more information, see How AWS WAF processes a web ACL.
Not nestable – You can't nest this statement type inside other statements, and you can't include it in a rule group. You can include it directly in a web ACL. 
WCUs – Set for the rule group at creation.
