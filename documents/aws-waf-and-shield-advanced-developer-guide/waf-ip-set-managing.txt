Creating and managing an IP set
An IP set provides a collection of IP addresses and IP address ranges that you want to use together in a rule statement. IP sets are AWS resources. 
To use an IP set in a web ACL or rule group, you first create an AWS resource, IPSet with your address specifications. Then you reference the set when you add an IP set rule statement to a web ACL or rule group.
