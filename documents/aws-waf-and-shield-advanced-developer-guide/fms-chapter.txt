AWS Firewall Manager
AWS Firewall Manager simplifies your AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, and Amazon VPC security groups administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and resources. With Firewall Manager, you set up your AWS WAF firewall rules, Shield Advanced protections, and Amazon VPC security groups just once. The service automatically applies the rules and protections across your accounts and resources, even as you add new resources. 
Firewall Manager provides these benefits:
 Helps to protect resources across accounts
 Helps to protect all resources of a particular type, such as all Amazon CloudFront distributions
 Helps to protect all resources with specific tags
 Automatically adds protection to resources that are added to your account
 Allows you to subscribe all member accounts in an AWS Organizations organization to AWS Shield Advanced, and automatically subscribes new in-scope accounts that join the organization
 Allows you to apply security group rules to all member accounts or specific subsets of accounts in an AWS Organizations organization, and automatically applies the rules to new in-scope accounts that join the organization
 Lets you use your own rules, or purchase managed rules from AWS Marketplace
Firewall Manager is particularly useful when you want to protect your entire organization rather than a small number of specific accounts and resources, or if you frequently add new resources that you want to protect. Firewall Manager also provides centralized monitoring of DDoS attacks across your organization.
