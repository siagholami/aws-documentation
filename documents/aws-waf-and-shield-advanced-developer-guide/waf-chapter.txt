AWS WAF
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP(S) requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an Application Load Balancer. 
AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an Application Load Balancer responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked.
Note
You can also use AWS WAF to protect your applications that are hosted in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) containers. Amazon ECS is a highly scalable, fast container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. To use this option, you configure Amazon ECS to use an Application Load Balancer that is enabled for AWS WAF to route and protect HTTP(S) layer 7 traffic across the tasks in your service. For more information, see Service Load Balancing in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
