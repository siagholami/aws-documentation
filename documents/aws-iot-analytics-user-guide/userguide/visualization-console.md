# Visualizing AWS IoT Analytics Data with the Console<a name="visualization-console"></a>

AWS IoT Analytics can embed the HTML output of your container data set \(found in the file "output\.html"\) on the container data set content page of the [AWS IoT Analytics console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/home) \. For example, if you define a container data set that runs a Jupyter notebook, and you create a visualization in your Jupyter notebook:

then, after the container data set content is created, you are able view this visualization on the console's **Data Set** content page:
