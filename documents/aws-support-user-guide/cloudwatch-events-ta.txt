Monitoring Trusted Advisor check results with Amazon CloudWatch Events
You can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to detect and react to changes in the status of Trusted Advisor checks. Then, based on the rules that you create, CloudWatch Events invokes one or more target actions when a check status changes to the value you specify in a rule. Depending on the type of status change, you might want to send notifications, capture status information, take corrective action, initiate events, or take other actions. You can select the following types of targets when using CloudWatch Events as a part of your Trusted Advisor workflow:
 AWS Lambda functions
 Amazon Kinesis streams
 Amazon Simple Queue Service queues
 Built-in targets (CloudWatch alarm actions)
 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics
The following are some use cases:
 Use a Lambda function to pass a notification to a Slack channel when check status changes.
 Push data about checks to a Kinesis stream to support comprehensive, real-time status monitoring.
For examples of using CloudWatch Events and Lambda functions to automate the response to Trusted Advisor check results, see Trusted Advisor tools.
The remainder of this topic describes the basic procedure for creating a CloudWatch Events rule for Trusted Advisor. Before you create event rules for Trusted Advisor, however, you should do the following:
 Familiarize yourself with events, rules, and targets in CloudWatch Events. For more information, see What is Amazon CloudWatch Events? and New CloudWatch Events â€“ track and respond to changes to your AWS resources.
 Create the target or targets you will use in your event rules.

Review your rule setup to make sure it meets your event-monitoring requirements.


In the Targets area, choose Add target*.


In the Select target type list, choose the type of target you prepared to use with this rule. Then, configure any additional options required by that type.
