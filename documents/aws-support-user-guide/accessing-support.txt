Access AWS Support
You can access the Support Center by using the following options:
 Use the email address and password associated with your AWS account.
 (Recommended) Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). 
If you have a Business or Enterprise support plan, you can also use the AWS Support API. The API lets you access AWS Support and Trusted Advisor operations programmatically. For more information, see the AWS Support API Reference.
AWS account
You can sign in to the AWS Management Console and access the Support Center by using your AWS account email address and password. This identity is called the AWS account root user. However, we strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, we recommend that you use IAM, which lets you control who can perform certain tasks in your account. 
IAM
By default, IAM users can't access the Support Center. You can use IAM to create individual users or groups. Then, you attach IAM policies to these entities, so that they have permission to perform actions and access resources, such as to open Support Center cases and use the AWS Support API.
After you create IAM users, you can give those users individual passwords and an account-specific sign-in page. They can then sign in to your AWS account and work in the Support Center. IAM users who have AWS Support access can see all cases that are created for the account.
For more information, see How IAM users sign in to your AWS account.
The easiest way to grant permissions is to attach the AWS managed policy AWSSupportAccess to the user, group, or role. AWS Support allows action-level permissions to control access to specific AWS Support operations. AWS Support doesn't provide resource-level access, so the Resource element is always set to *. 
For example, this policy statement grants an IAM user access to AWS Support. An IAM user with this policy can access all AWS Support operations and resources.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "support:*",
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}
This policy statement allows an IAM user to perform all actions in AWS Support except resolve a case.
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
   {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "support:*",
      "Resource": "*"
   },
   {
       "Effect": "Deny",
       "Action": "support:ResolveCase",
       "Resource": "*"
    }]
}
If the user or group already has a policy, you can add the AWS Support-specific policy statement to that policy. 
Important
If you can't view cases in the Support Center, make sure that you have the required permissions. You might need to contact your IAM administrator. For more information, see Identity and access management for AWS Support.
Access to AWS Trusted Advisor
In the AWS Management Console, a separate trustedadvisor IAM namespace controls access to Trusted Advisor. In the AWS Support API, the support IAM namespace controls access to Trusted Advisor. For more information, see Controlling access to the Trusted Advisor console.
