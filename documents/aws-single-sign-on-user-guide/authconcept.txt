User Authentications
A user signs in to the user portal using their user name. When they do, AWS SSO redirects the request to the AWS SSO authentication service based on the directory associated with the user email address. Once authenticated, users have SSO access to any of the AWS accounts and third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications that show up in the portal without additional sign-in prompts. This means that users no longer need to keep track of multiple account credentials for the various assigned AWS applications that they use on a daily basis.
