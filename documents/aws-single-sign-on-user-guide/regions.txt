AWS SSO Region Availability
AWS SSO is available in several commonly used AWS Regions. This availability makes it easier for you to configure user access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications. When your users sign in to the user portal, they can select the AWS account that they have permission to. Then they can access the AWS Management Console. For a full list of the Regions that AWS SSO supports, see AWS Regions and Endpoints. 
AWS SSO Region Data
When you first enable AWS SSO, all the data that you configure in AWS SSO is stored in the Region where you configured it. This data includes directory configurations, permission sets, application instances, and user assignments to AWS account applications. If you are using the AWS SSO identity store, all users and groups that you create in AWS SSO are also stored in the same Region. 
AWS Organizations only supports one AWS SSO Region at a time. If you want to make AWS SSO available in a different Region, you must first delete your current AWS SSO configuration. Switching to a different Region also changes the URL for the user portal. 
Delete Your AWS SSO Configuration
When an AWS SSO configuration is deleted, all the data in that configuration is deleted and cannot be recovered. The following table describes what data is deleted based on the directory type that you have currently configured in AWS SSO.
