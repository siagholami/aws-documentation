OneLogin
AWS SSO supports automatic provisioning (synchronization) of user and group information from OneLogin into AWS SSO using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) v2.0 protocol. You configure this connection in OneLogin, using your SCIM endpoint for AWS SSO and a bearer token that is created automatically by AWS SSO. When you configure SCIM synchronization, you create a mapping of your user attributes in OneLogin to the named attributes in AWS SSO. This causes the expected attributes to match between AWS SSO and OneLogin. 
The following steps walk you through how to enable automatic provisioning of users and groups from OneLogin to AWS SSO using the SCIM protocol.
Note
Before you begin deploying SCIM, we recommend that you first review the Considerations for Using Automatic Provisioning.

 Troubleshooting
Prerequisites
You will need the following before you can get started:
 A OneLogin account. If you do not have an existing account, you may be able to obtain a free trial or developer account from the OneLogin website.
 An AWS SSO-enabled account (free). For more information, see Enable AWS SSO.
 A SAML connection from your OneLogin account to AWS SSO. For more information, see Enabling Single Sign-On Between OneLogin and AWS on the AWS Partner Network Blog.
Step 1: Enable Provisioning in AWS SSO
In this first step, you use the AWS SSO console to enable automatic provisioning.
To enable automatic provisioning in AWS SSO


After you have completed the prerequisites, open the AWS SSO console.


Choose Settings in the left navigation pane.


On the Settings page, under Identity source > Provisioning, choose Enable automatic provisioning. This immediately enables automatic provisioning in AWS SSO and displays the necessary endpoint and access token information.


In the Inbound automatic provisioning dialog box, copy each of the values for the following options. You will need to paste these in later when you configure provisioning in your IdP.


SCIM endpoint


Access token


Choose Close.


You have now set up provisioning in the AWS SSO console. Now you need to do the remaining tasks using the OneLogin admin console as described in the following procedure.
Step 2: Configure Provisioning in OneLogin
Use the following procedure in the OneLogin admin console to enable integration between AWS SSO and the AWS Single Sign-On app. This procedure assumes you have already configured the AWS Single Sign-On application in OneLogin for SAML authentication. If you have not yet created this SAML connection, please do so before proceeding and then return here to complete the SCIM provisioning process. For more information about configuring SAML with OneLogin, see Enabling Single Sign-On Between OneLogin and AWS on the AWS Partner Network Blog.
To configure provisioning in OneLogin


Sign in to OneLogin, and then navigate to Applications > Applications. 


On the Applications page, search for the application you created previously to form your SAML connection with AWS SSO, select it, and then choose Configuration from the left navigation bar.


In the previous procedure you copied the SCIM endpoint value in AWS SSO. Paste that value into the SCIM Base URL field in OneLogin. Make sure that you remove the trailing forward slash at the end of the URL. Also, in the previous procedure you copied the Access token value in AWS SSO. Paste that value into the SCIM Bearer Token field in OneLogin.


Next to API Connection, click Enable, and then click Save to complete the configuration.


In the left navigation bar, choose Provisioning.


Select the check boxes for Enable provisioning, Create user, Delete user, and Update user, and then choose Save.


In the left navigation bar, choose Users.


Click More Actions and select Sync logins. You should receive the message Synchronizing users with AWS Single Sign-on.


Click More Actions again, and then select Reapply entitlement mappings. You should receive the message Mappings are being reapplied.


At this point, the provisioning process should begin. To confirm this, navigate to Activity > Events, and monitor the progress. Successful provisioning events, as well as errors, should appear in the event stream.


To verify that your users and groups have all been successfully synchronized to AWS SSO, return to the AWS SSO Console and select Users. Your synchronized users from OneLogin will appear on the Users page. You can also view your synchronized groups on the Groups page.


To synchronize user changes automatically to AWS SSO, navigate to the Provisioning page, locate the Require admin approval before this action is performed section, de-select Create User, Delete User, and/or Update User, and click Save.


Troubleshooting
The following can help you troubleshoot some common issues you might encounter while setting up automatic provisioning with OneLogin.
Groups are not provisioned to AWS SSO
By default, groups may not be provisioned from OneLogin to AWS SSO. Ensure that you’ve enabled group provisioning for your AWS SSO application in OneLogin. To do this, sign in to the OneLogin admin console, and check to make sure that the Include in User Provisioning option is selected under the properties of the AWS SSO application (AWS SSO application > Parameters > Groups). For more details on how to create groups in OneLogin, including how to synchronize OneLogin roles as groups in SCIM, please see the OneLogin website.
Nothing is synchronized from OneLogin to AWS SSO, despite all settings being correct
In addition to the note above regarding admin approval, you will need to Reapply entitlement mappings for many configuration changes to take effect. This can be found in Applications > Applications > AWS SSO application > More Actions. You can see details and logs for most actions in OneLogin, including synchronization events, under Activity > Events.
I’ve deleted or disabled a group in OneLogin, but it still appears in AWS SSO
OneLogin currently does not support the SCIM DELETE operation for groups, which means that the group will continue to exist in AWS SSO. You must therefore remove the group from AWS SSO directly to ensure that any corresponding permissions in AWS SSO for that group are removed.
I deleted a group in AWS SSO without first deleting it from OneLogin and now I’m having user/group sync issues
To remedy this situation, first ensure that you do not have any redundant group provisioning rules or configurations in OneLogin. For example, a group directly assigned to an application along with a rule that publishes to the same group. Next, delete any undesirable groups in AWS SSO. Finally, in OneLogin, Refresh the entitlements (AWS SSO App > Provisioning > Entitlements), and then Reapply entitlement mappings (AWS SSO App > More Actions). To avoid this issue in the future, first make the change to stop provisioning the group in OneLogin, then delete the group from AWS SSO.
