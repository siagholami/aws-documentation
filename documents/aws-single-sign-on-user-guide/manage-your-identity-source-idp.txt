Connect to Your External Identity Provider
You can use AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) to authenticate identities from external identity providers (IdPs) through the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 standard. This enables your users to sign in to the AWS SSO user portal with their corporate credentials. They can then navigate to their assigned accounts, roles, and applications hosted in external identity providers.
For example, you can connect an external IdP such as Okta or Azure Active Directory (AD), to AWS SSO. Your users can then sign in to the AWS SSO user portal with their existing Okta or Azure credentials. In addition, you can assign access permissions centrally for your users across all the accounts and applications in your AWS organization. In addition, developers can simply sign in to the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) using their existing credentials, and benefit from automatic short-term credential generation and rotation.
The SAML protocol does not provide a way to query the IdP to learn about users and groups. Therefore, you must make AWS SSO aware of those users and groups by provisioning them into AWS SSO.
Provisioning When Users Come from an External Identity Provider
When using an external IdP, you must provision all users and groups into AWS SSO before you can make any assignments to AWS accounts or applications. In this case you have two options: You can configure Automatic Provisioning, or you can configure Manual Provisioning of your users and groups. Regardless of how you provision users, AWS SSO redirects the AWS Management Console, command line interface, and application authentication to your external IdP. AWS SSO then grants access to those resources based on policies you create in AWS SSO. For more information about provisioning, see User and group provisioning.
How to Connect to an External Identity Provider
Use the following procedure to connect to an external identity provider from the AWS SSO console.
To connect to an external identity provider


Open the AWS SSO console.


Choose Settings


On the Settings page, under Identity source, choose Change.


On the Change identity source page, select External identity provider. Then do the following:


Under Service provider metadata, choose Download metadata file to download the metadata file and save it on your system. The AWS SSO SAML metadata file is required by your external identity provider.


Under Identity provider metadata, choose Browse to search for the metadata file that you downloaded from your external identity provider. Then upload the file. This metadata file contains the necessary public x509 certificate used to trust messages sent from the IdP.


Choose Next: Review.
Important
Changing your source to or from Active Directory removes all existing user and group assignments. You must manually reapply assignments after you have successfully changed your source.


Once you have read the disclaimer and are ready to proceed, type CONFIRM.


Choose Finish.
