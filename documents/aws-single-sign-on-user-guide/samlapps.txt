Custom SAML 2.0 Applications
You can use the AWS SSO application configuration wizard to add support for applications that allow identity federation using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0. In the console, you set these up by choosing Custom SAML 2.0 application from the application selector. Most of the steps for configuring a custom SAML application are the same as configuring a cloud application. 
However, you also need to provide additional SAML attribute mappings for a custom SAML application. These mappings tell AWS SSO how to populate the SAML assertion correctly for your application. You can provide this additional SAML attribute mapping when you set up the application for the first time. You can also provide SAML attribute mappings on the application detail page that is accessible from the AWS SSO console.
Add and Configure a Custom SAML 2.0 Application
Use this procedure when you need to set up a SAML trust relationship between AWS SSO and your custom application's service provider. Before you begin this procedure, make sure that you have the service provider's certificate and metadata exchange files so that you can finish setting up the trust.
To add and configure a custom SAML application


In the AWS SSO console, choose Applications in the left navigation pane. Then choose Add a new application.


In the Select an application dialog box, select Custom SAML 2.0 application from the list. Then choose Configure application. 


On the Configure  page, under Details, enter a Display name for the application, such as MyApp.


Under AWS SSO metadata, do the following:


Next to AWS SSO SAML metadatafile, choose Download to download the identity provider metadata.


Next to AWS SSO certificate, choose Download certificate to download the identity provider certificate.
Note
You will need these files later when you set up the custom application from the service provider's website. 


(Optional) Under Application properties, you can specify additional properties for the Application start URL, Relay State, and Session Duration. For more information, see Application Properties.


Under Application metadata, provide the Application ACS URL and Application SAML audience values.


Choose Save changes to save the configuration.
