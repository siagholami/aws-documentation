# Set Up SSO to Your Applications<a name="step4"></a>

With AWS SSO, you can use AWS applications that are integrated with AWS SSO, cloud\-applications for which AWS provides preintegration, and custom SAML 2\.0 applications\. Depending on which application type you are trying to set up, review the topics below: 
+ [Add and Configure an AWS SSO\-Integrated Application](awsapps.md#awsapps-add-config-app)
+ [Add and Configure a Cloud Application](saasapps.md#saasapps-addconfigapp)
+ [Add and Configure a Custom SAML 2\.0 Application](samlapps.md#addconfigcustomapp)

For more information about supported application types, see [Manage SSO to Your Applications](manage-your-applications.md)\.

After you follow the guidance in the topic, you will have successfully configured AWS SSO and set up a trust with your service provider\. Your users can now access these applications from within their user portal based on the permissions you assigned\.
