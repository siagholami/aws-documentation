# Choose Your Identity Source<a name="step2"></a>

Choosing an identity source determines where AWS SSO looks for users and groups that need SSO access\. By default, you get an AWS SSO store for quick and easy user management\. Optionally, you can also connect an external identity provider or connect an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory with your self\-managed Active Directory\.

AWS SSO provides users in this identity source with a personalized user portal from which they can easily launch multiple AWS accounts or cloud applications\. Users sign in to the portal using their corporate credentials or with credentials they set up in AWS SSO\. Once they sign in, they have one\-click access to all applications and AWS accounts that you have previously authorized\.

Depending on which identity source type you are trying to set up, review the topics below for guidance:
