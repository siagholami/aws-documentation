Creating the service role for your account
Amazon ECS needs permissions to register and deregister container instances with your load balancer when tasks are created and stopped.
In most cases, the Amazon ECS service role is automatically created for you in the Amazon ECS console first run experience. You can use the following procedure to check and see if your account already has an Amazon ECS service role.
To check for the ecsServiceRole in the IAM console


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles. 


Search the list of roles for ecsServiceRole. If the role does not exist, see Service Scheduler IAM Role to create the role. If the role does exist, select the role to view the attached policies.


Choose Permissions.


In the Managed Policies section, ensure that the AmazonEC2ContainerServiceRole managed policy is attached to the role. If the policy is attached, your Amazon ECS service role is properly configured. If not, follow the substeps below to attach the policy.


Choose Attach Policy.


For Filter, type AmazonEC2ContainerServiceRole to narrow the available policies to attach.


Select the box to the left of the AmazonEC2ContainerServiceRole policy and choose Attach Policy.


Choose Trust Relationships, Edit Trust Relationship.


Verify that the trust relationship contains the following policy. If the trust relationship matches the policy below, choose Cancel. If the trust relationship does not match, copy the policy into the Policy Document window and choose Update Trust Policy.
