Legacy IAM Roles for Amazon ECS
Prior to the introduction of the AWSServiceRoleForECS IAM role, you were required to create separate IAM roles to enable Amazon ECS permissions to call Elastic Load Balancing and Application Auto Scaling APIs on your behalf.
The Amazon ECS service scheduler IAM role grants the Amazon ECS service scheduler permissions that it needs to register and deregister container instances with your load balancers. You can optionally create the service scheduler IAM role and specify it when creating a service, or preferably you can allow Amazon ECS to use the service-linked role.
The Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling IAM role grants Amazon ECS permission to describe your CloudWatch alarms and registered services, as well as permission to update your Amazon ECS service's desired count on your behalf.
These legacy IAM roles are described in more detail below, but have effectively been replaced by the Amazon ECS service-linked role.
Service Scheduler IAM Role
Amazon ECS provides a managed IAM policy named AmazonEC2ContainerServiceRole to use for the service scheduler IAM role. The AmazonEC2ContainerServiceRole policy is shown below.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
                "ec2:Describe*",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DeregisterInstancesFromLoadBalancer",
                "elasticloadbalancing:DeregisterTargets",
                "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
                "elasticloadbalancing:RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer",
                "elasticloadbalancing:RegisterTargets"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Note
The ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress rule is reserved for future use. Amazon ECS does not automatically update the security groups associated with Elastic Load Balancing load balancers or Amazon ECS container instances.
