ecs-cli down
Deletes the AWS CloudFormation stack that was created by ecs-cli up and the associated resources.
Note
The Amazon ECS CLI can only manage tasks, services, and container instances that were created with the Amazon ECS CLI. To manage tasks, services, and container instances that weren't created by the Amazon ECS CLI, use the AWS Command Line Interface or the AWS Management Console.
The ecs-cli down command attempts to delete the cluster specified in ~/.ecs/config. However, if there are any active services (even with a desired count of 0) or registered container instances in your cluster that were not created by ecs-cli up, the cluster is not deleted and the services and pre-existing container instances remain active. This might happen, for example, if you used an existing ECS cluster with registered container instances, such as the default cluster.
If you have remaining services or container instances in your cluster that you would like to remove, you can follow the procedures in Deleting a cluster to delete your cluster.
Important
Some features described might only be available with the latest version of the Amazon ECS CLI. For more information about obtaining the latest version, see Installing the Amazon ECS CLI.
