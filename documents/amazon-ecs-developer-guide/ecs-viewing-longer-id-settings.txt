Viewing account settings
You can use the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI tools to view the resource types that support the new ARN and ID formats or the increased ENI limits.
Important
Amazon ECS ARN and resource ID settings that have not been explicitly set will be affected by the format timeline. The console displays an Undefined value and the AWS CLI returns an empty set when a value has not been explicitly set. For more information, see ARN and resource ID format timeline.
To view your account settings using the console


Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.


In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, select the Region for which to view your account settings. 


From the dashboard, choose Account Settings.


On the Amazon ECS ARN and resource ID settings, AWSVPC Trunking, and CloudWatch Container Insights sections, you can view your opt-in status for each account setting for the authenticated IAM user and role.


To view your account settings using the command line
Use one of the following commands to view your account settings.
 list-account-settings (AWS CLI)
aws ecs list-account-settings --effective-settings --region us-east-1
 Get-ECSAccountSetting (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)
Get-ECSAccountSetting -EffectiveSetting true -Region us-east-1
To view the account settings for a specific IAM user or IAM role using the command line
Use one of the following commands and specify the ARN of an IAM user, IAM role, or root account user in the request to view their account settings.
 list-account-settings (AWS CLI)
aws ecs list-account-settings --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::aws_account_id:user/principalName --effective-settings --region us-east-1
 Get-ECSAccountSetting (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)
