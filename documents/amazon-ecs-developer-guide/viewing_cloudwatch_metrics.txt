Viewing Amazon ECS metrics
After you have enabled CloudWatch metrics for Amazon ECS, you can view those metrics on the Amazon ECS and CloudWatch consoles. The Amazon ECS console provides a 24-hour maximum, minimum, and average view of your cluster and service metrics. The CloudWatch console provides a fine-grained and customizable display of your resources, as well as the number of running tasks in a service.
