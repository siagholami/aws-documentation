Troubleshooting IAM Roles for Tasks
If you are having trouble configuring IAM roles for tasks in your cluster, you can try this known good configuration to help debug your own configuration.
The following procedure helps you to:
 Create a CloudWatch Logs log group to store your test logs.
 Create a task IAM role that has full Amazon ECS permissions.
 Register a task definition with a known good AWS CLI configuration that is compatible with IAM roles for tasks.
 Run a task from that task definition to test your container instance support for IAM roles for tasks.
 View the container logs from that task in CloudWatch Logs to verify that it works.
To test IAM roles for tasks with a known good configuration


Create a CloudWatch Logs log group called ecs-tasks.


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Logs, Actions, Create log group.


For Log Group Name, enter ecs-tasks and choose Create log group.


Create an IAM role for your task to use.


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles, Create role. 


For Select type of trusted entity, choose Elastic Container Service.


For Select your use case, choose Elastic Container Service Task, Next: Permissions.


On the Attached permissions policy page, choose AmazonEC2ContainerServiceFullAccess, Next: Review.


On the Review page, for Role name, enter ECS-task-full-access and choose Create role.


Register a task definition that uses your new role.


Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.


In the navigation pane, choose Task Definitions.


On the Task Definitions page, choose Create new Task Definition.


On the Select launch type compatibility page, choose EC2, Next step.


Scroll to the bottom of the page and choose Configure via JSON.


Paste the sample task definition JSON below into the text area (replacing the pre-populated JSON there) and choose Save.
Note
Replace the awslogs-region value with the region in which you created your CloudWatch Logs log group.
{
      "taskRoleArn": "ECS-task-full-access",
      "containerDefinitions": [
          {
              "memory": 128,
              "essential": true,

                  "/bin/bash",
                  "-c"
              ],
              "command": [
                  "yum install -y aws-cli; aws ecs list-tasks --region us-west-2"
              ],
              "logConfiguration": {
                  "logDriver": "awslogs",
                  "options": {
                      "awslogs-group": "ecs-tasks",
                      "awslogs-region": "us-west-2",
                      "awslogs-stream-prefix": "iam-role-test"
                  }
              }
          }
      ],
      "family": "iam-role-test",
      "requiresCompatibilities": [
          "EC2"

      "volumes": [],
      "placementConstraints": [],
      "networkMode": null,
      "memory": null,
      "cpu": null
  }


Verify your information and choose Create.


Run a task from your task definition.


On the Task Definition: iam-role-test registration confirmation page, choose Actions, Run Task.


On the Run Task page, choose the EC2 launch type, a cluster, and then choose Run Task to run your task.


View the container logs in the CloudWatch Logs console.


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Logs.


Select the ecs-tasks log group.


Select the most recent log stream.


Scroll down to view the last lines of the log stream. You should see the output of the aws ecs list-tasks command.
{
      "taskArns": [
          "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:aws_account_id:task/d48feb62-46e2-4cbc-a36b-e0400b993d1d"
      ]
  }
If you receive an "Unable to locate credentials" error, then the following are possible causes.
   The IAM roles for tasks feature is not enabled on your container instances. For more information, see Enabling Task IAM Roles on your Container Instances.
   The credential URL is being throttled. You can use the ECS_TASK_METADATA_RPS_LIMIT container agent parameter to configure the throttle limits. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration.
