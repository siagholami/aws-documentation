Using Spot Instances
A Spot Instance is an unused Amazon EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. The hourly price for a Spot Instance is called a Spot price. The Spot price of each instance type in each Availability Zone is set by Amazon EC2, and adjusted gradually based on the long-term supply of and demand for Spot Instances. For more information, see Spot Instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
You can register Spot Instances to your Amazon ECS clusters. For more information, see Launching an Amazon ECS Container Instance.
Spot Instance Draining
Amazon EC2 terminates, stops, or hibernates your Spot Instance when the Spot price exceeds the maximum price for your request or capacity is no longer available. Amazon EC2 provides a Spot Instance interruption notice, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before it is interrupted. If Amazon ECS Spot Instance draining is enabled on the instance, ECS receives the Spot Instance interruption notice and places the instance in DRAINING status.
Important
Amazon ECS monitors for the Spot Instance interruption notices that have the terminate and stop instance-actions. If you specified either the hibernate instance interruption behavior when requesting your Spot Instances or Spot Fleet, then Amazon ECS Spot Instance draining is not supported for those instances.
When a container instance is set to DRAINING, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance. Service tasks on the draining container instance that are in the PENDING state are stopped immediately. If there are container instances in the cluster that are available, replacement service tasks are started on them.
Spot Instance draining is disabled by default and must be manually enabled. To enable Spot Instance draining for a new container instance, when launching the container instance add the following script into the User data field, replacing MyCluster with the name of the cluster to register the container instance to.
```
!/bin/bash
cat <<'EOF' >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
ECS_CLUSTER=MyCluster
ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true
EOF
```
For more information, see Launching an Amazon ECS Container Instance.
To enable Spot Instance draining for an existing container instance


Connect to the Spot Instance over SSH.


Edit the /etc/ecs/ecs.config file and add the following:


ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true


Restart the ecs service.
    For the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI:
sudo systemctl restart ecs
    For the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux AMI:
sudo stop ecs && sudo start ecs


(Optional) You can verify that the agent is running and see some information about your new container instance by querying the agent introspection API operation. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Introspection.
