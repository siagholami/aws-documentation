Amazon Elastic Container Service on AWS Outposts
AWS Outposts enables native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models in on-premises facilities. In AWS Outposts environments, you can use the same AWS APIs, tools, and infrastructure that you use in the AWS Cloud. Amazon ECS on AWS Outposts is ideal for low-latency workloads that need to be run in close proximity to on-premises data and applications. For more information about AWS Outposts, see the AWS Outposts User Guide.
Prerequisites
The following are the prerequisites for using Amazon ECS on AWS Outposts:
 You must have installed and configured an Outpost in your on-premises data center.
 You must have a reliable network connection between your Outpost and its AWS Region.
 You must have sufficient capacity of instance types available in your Outpost.
 All Amazon ECS container instances must have Amazon ECS container agent 1.33.0 or later.
Limitations
The following are the limitations of using Amazon ECS on Outposts:
 Amazon Elastic Container Registry, AWS Identity and Access Management, Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, Classic Load Balancer, and Amazon Route 53 run in the AWS Region, not on Outposts. This will increase latencies between these services and the containers.
 AWS Fargate is not available on AWS Outposts.
Network Connectivity Considerations
The following are network connectivity considerations for AWS Outposts:
 If network connectivity between your Outpost and its AWS Region is lost, your clusters will continue to run. However, you cannot create new clusters or take new actions on existing clusters until connectivity is restored. In case of instance failures, the instance will not be automatically replaced. The CloudWatch Logs agent will be unable to update logs and event data.
 We recommend that you provide reliable, highly available, and low latency connectivity between your Outpost and its AWS Region.
Creating an Amazon ECS Cluster on an Outpost
Creating an Amazon ECS cluster on an Outpost is similar to creating an Amazon ECS cluster in the AWS Cloud. When you create an Amazon ECS cluster on an Outpost, you must specify a subnet associated with your Outpost.
An Outpost is an extension of an AWS Region, and you can extend an Amazon VPC in an account to span multiple Availability Zones and any associated Outposts. When you configure your Outpost, you associate a subnet with it to extend your Regional VPC environment to your on-premises facility. Instances on an Outpost appear as part of your Regional VPC, similar to an Availability Zone with associated subnets.

AWS CLI 
To create an Amazon ECS cluster on an Outpost with the AWS CLI, specify a security group and a subnet that is associated with your Outpost.
To create a subnet associated with your Outpost.
aws ec2 create-subnet \
    --cidr-block 10.0.3.0/24 \
    --vpc-id vpc-xxxxxxxx \
    --outpost-arn arn:aws:outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/op-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
    --availability-zone-id usw2-az1
The following example creates an Amazon ECS cluster on an Outpost.

Create a role and policy with rights on Outpost.

aws iam create-role –-role-name ecsRole \
       –assume-role-policy-document file://ecs-policy.json
   aws iam put-role-policy –-role-name ecsRole –-policy-name ecsRolePolicy \
       –-policy-document file://role-policy.json

Create an IAM instance profile with rights on Outpost.

aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name outpost
   aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name outpost \
       --role-name ecsRole

Create a VPC.

aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16

Create a security group for the container instances, specifying the proper CIDR range for the Outpost. (This step is different for AWS Outposts.)

aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name MyOutpostSG
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name MyOutpostSG --protocol tcp \
       --port 22 --cidr 10.0.3.0/24
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress -~-~group-name MyOutpostSG -~-~protocol tcp \
       --port 80 --cidr 10.0.3.0/24


Create the Cluster.


Define the Amazon ECS container agent environment variables to launch the instance into the cluster created in the previous step and define any necessary tags.


#! /bin/bash
   cat << ‘EOF’ >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
   ECS_CLUSTER=MyCluster
   ECS_IMAGE_PULL_BEHAVIOR=prefer-cached
   ECS_CONTAINER_INSTANCE_TAGS={“environment”: ”Outpost”}
   EOF
Note
In order to avoid delays caused by pulling container images from Amazon ECR in the Region, use image caches. To do this, each time a task is run, configure the Amazon ECS agent to default to using the cached image on the instance itself by setting ECS_IMAGE_PULL_BEHAVIOR to prefer-cached. 

Create the container instance, specifying the VPC and subnet for the Outpost where this instance should run and an instance type that is available on the Outpost. (This step is different for AWS Outposts.)

aws ec2 run-instances --count 1 --image-id ami-xxxxxxxx --instance-type c5.large \
       --key-name aws-outpost-key –-subnet-id subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
       --iam-instance-profile Name outpost --security-group-id sg-xxxxxx \
       --associate-public-ip-address --user-data file://userdata.txt
Note
This command is also used when adding additional instances to the cluster. Any containers deployed in the cluster will be placed on that specific Outpost.

Register a task definition.

aws ecs register-task-definition -~-~cli-input-json file://ecs-task.json

Run the task or create the service.


[ Run the task ]
aws ecs run-task --cluster mycluster --count 1 --task-definition outpost-app:1

[ Create the service ]
aws ecs create-service –-cluster mycluster –-service-name outpost-service \
       –-task-definition outpost-app:1 –-desired-count 1
