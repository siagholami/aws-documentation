Specifying sensitive data using Secrets Manager
Amazon ECS enables you to inject sensitive data into your containers by storing your sensitive data in AWS Secrets Manager secrets and then referencing them in your container definition. Sensitive data stored in Secrets Manager secrets can be exposed to a container as environment variables or as part of the log configuration.
When you inject a secret as an environment variable, you can specify a JSON key or version of a secret to inject. This process helps you control the sensitive data exposed to your container. For more information about secret versioning, see Key Terms and Concepts for AWS Secrets Manager in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.
Considerations for specifying sensitive data using Secrets Manager
The following should be considered when using Secrets Manager to specify sensitive data for containers.
 For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the following should be considered:
   It is only supported to inject the full contents of a secret as an environment variable. Specifying a specific JSON key or version is not supported at this time.
   To inject the full content of a secret as an environment variable or in a log configuration, you must use platform version 1.3.0 or later. For information, see AWS Fargate platform versions.
 For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the following should be considered:
   To inject a secret using a specific JSON key or version of a secret, your container instance must have version 1.37.0 or later of the container agent. However, we recommend using the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version, see Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent.
To inject the full contents of a secret as an environment variable or to inject a secret in a log configuration, your container instance must have version 1\.22\.0 or later of the container agent\.


Only secrets that store text data, which are secrets created with the SecretString parameter of the CreateSecret API, are supported. Secrets that store binary data, which are secrets created with the SecretBinary parameter of the CreateSecret API are not supported.
When using a task definition that references Secrets Manager secrets to retrieve sensitive data for your containers, if you are also using interface VPC endpoints, you must create the interface VPC endpoints for Secrets Manager. For more information, see Using Secrets Manager with VPC Endpoints in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.
Sensitive data is injected into your container when the container is initially started. If the secret is subsequently updated or rotated, the container will not receive the updated value automatically. You must either launch a new task or if your task is part of a service you can update the service and use the Force new deployment option to force the service to launch a fresh task.
For Windows tasks that are configured to use the awslogs logging driver, you must also set the ECS_ENABLE_AWSLOGS_EXECUTIONROLE_OVERRIDE environment variable on your container instance. This can be done with User Data using the following syntax:

```
  
Initialize-ECSAgent -Cluster  -EnableTaskIAMRole -LoggingDrivers '["json-file","awslogs"]'
  
  ```
Required IAM permissions for Amazon ECS secrets
To use this feature, you must have the Amazon ECS task execution role and reference it in your task definition. This allows the container agent to pull the necessary Secrets Manager resources. For more information, see Amazon ECS task execution IAM role.
Important
For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, you must use the ECS agent configuration variable ECS_ENABLE_AWSLOGS_EXECUTIONROLE_OVERRIDE=true to use this feature. You can add it to the ./etc/ecs/ecs.config file during container instance creation or you can add it to an existing instance and then restart the ECS agent. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration.
To provide access to the Secrets Manager secrets that you create, manually add the following permissions as an inline policy to the task execution role. For more information, see Adding and Removing IAM Policies.
 secretsmanager:GetSecretValue–Required if you are referencing a Secrets Manager secret.
 kms:Decrypt–Required only if your secret uses a custom KMS key and not the default key. The ARN for your custom key should be added as a resource.
The following example inline policy adds the required permissions.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "kms:Decrypt"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<aws_account_id>:secret:<secret_name>",
        "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<aws_account_id>:key/<key_id>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Injecting sensitive data as an environment variable
Within your container definition, you can specify the following:
 The secrets object containing the name of the environment variable to set in the container
 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Secrets Manager secret
 Additional parameters that contain the sensitive data to present to the container
The following example shows the full syntax that must be specified for the Secrets Manager secret.
arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:aws_account_id:secret:secret-name:json-key:version-stage:version-id
Important
If you are using AWS Fargate, it is only supported to specify the full ARN of the secret in your task definition. Specifying a specific JSON key or version is not supported at this time.
The following section describes the additional parameters. These parameters are optional, but if you do not use them, you must include the colons : to use the default values. Examples are provided below for more context.
json-key
Specifies the name of the key in a key-value pair with the value that you want to set as the environment variable value. Only values in JSON format are supported. If you do not specify a JSON key, then the full contents of the secret is used.
version-stage
Specifies the staging label of the version of a secret that you want to use. If a version staging label is specified, you cannot specify a version ID. If no version stage is specified, the default behavior is to retrieve the secret with the AWSCURRENT staging label.
Staging labels are used to keep track of different versions of a secret when they are either updated or rotated. Each version of a secret has one or more staging labels and an ID. For more information, see Key Terms and Concepts for AWS Secrets Manager in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.
version-id
Specifies the unique identifier of the version of a secret that you want to use. If a version ID is specified, you cannot specify a version staging label. If no version ID is specified, the default behavior is to retrieve the secret with the AWSCURRENT staging label.
Version IDs are used to keep track of different versions of a secret when they are either updated or rotated. Each version of a secret has an ID. For more information, see Key Terms and Concepts for AWS Secrets Manager in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.

        "name": "splunk-token",
        "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:aws_account_id:secret:secret_name-AbCdEf"
      }]
    }]
  }]
}
Creating an AWS Secrets Manager secret
You can use the Secrets Manager console to create a secret for your sensitive data. For more information, see Creating a Basic Secret in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.
To create a basic secret
Use Secrets Manager to create a secret for your sensitive data.


Open the Secrets Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/.


Choose Store a new secret.


For Select secret type, choose Other type of secrets.


Specify the details of your custom secret as Key and Value pairs. For example, you can specify a key of UserName, and then supply the appropriate user name as its value. Add a second key with the name of Password and the password text as its value. You could also add entries for a database name, server address, TCP port, and so on. You can add as many pairs as you need to store the information you require.


Alternatively, you can choose the Plaintext tab and enter the secret value in any way you like.


Choose the AWS KMS encryption key that you want to use to encrypt the protected text in the secret. If you don't choose one, Secrets Manager checks to see if there's a default key for the account, and uses it if it exists. If a default key doesn't exist, Secrets Manager creates one for you automatically. You can also choose Add new key to create a custom CMK specifically for this secret. To create your own AWS KMS CMK, you must have permissions to create CMKs in your account.


Choose Next.


For Secret name, type an optional path and name, such as production/MyAwesomeAppSecret or development/TestSecret, and choose Next. You can optionally add a description to help you remember the purpose of this secret later.


The secret name must be ASCII letters, digits, or any of the following characters: /_=.@-

(Optional) At this point, you can configure rotation for your secret. For this procedure, leave it at Disable automatic rotation and choose Next.

For information about how to configure rotation on new or existing secrets, see Rotating Your AWS Secrets Manager Secrets.

Review your settings, and then choose Store secret to save everything you entered as a new secret in Secrets Manager.

Creating a task definition that references sensitive data
You can use the Amazon ECS console to create a task definition that references an Secrets Manager secret.
To create a task definition that specifies a secret


Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.


In the navigation pane, choose task definitions, Create new task definition.


On the Select launch type compatibility page, choose the launch type for your tasks and choose Next step.
Note
This step only applies to Regions that currently support Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate. For more information, see Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate.


For task definition Name, type a name for your task definition. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.


For Task execution role, either select your existing task execution role or choose Create new role to have one created for you. This role authorizes Amazon ECS to pull private images for your task. For more information, see Required IAM permissions for private registry authentication.
Important
If the Task execution role field does not appear, choose Configure via JSON and manually add the executionRoleArn field to specify your task execution role. The following code shows the syntax:  


"executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws_account_id:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole"


For each container to create in your task definition, complete the following steps:


Under Container Definitions, choose Add container.


For Container name, type a name for your container. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.


For Image, type the image name or path to your private image. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.


Expand Advanced container configuration.


For sensitive data to inject as environment variables, under Environment, for Environment variables, complete the following fields:


For Key, enter the name of the environment variable to set in the container. This corresponds to the name field in the secrets section of a container definition.


For Value, choose ValueFrom. For Add value, enter the ARN of the Secrets Manager secret that contains the data to present to your container as an environment variable.




For sensitive data referenced in the log configuration for a container, under Storage and Logging, for Log configuration, complete the following fields:


Clear the Auto-configure CloudWatch Logs option.


Under Log options, for Key, enter the name of the log configuration option to set.


For Value, choose ValueFrom. For Add value, enter the full ARN of the Secrets Manager secret that contains the data to present to your log configuration as a log option.




Fill out the remaining required fields and any optional fields to use in your container definitions. More container definition parameters are available in the Advanced container configuration menu. For more information, see Task definition parameters.


Choose Add.


When your containers are added, choose Create.
