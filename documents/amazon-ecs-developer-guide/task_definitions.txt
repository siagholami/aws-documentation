Amazon ECS Task definitions
A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. Some of the parameters you can specify in a task definition include:
 The Docker image to use with each container in your task
 How much CPU and memory to use with each task or each container within a task
 The launch type to use, which determines the infrastructure on which your tasks are hosted
 The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in your task
 The logging configuration to use for your tasks
 Whether the task should continue to run if the container finishes or fails
 The command the container should run when it is started
 Any data volumes that should be used with the containers in the task
 The IAM role that your tasks should use
You can define multiple containers in a task definition. The parameters that you use depend on the launch type you choose for the task. Not all parameters are valid. For more information about the parameters available and which launch types they are valid for in a task definition, see Task definition parameters.
Your entire application stack does not need to exist on a single task definition, and in most cases it should not. Your application can span multiple task definitions by combining related containers into their own task definitions, each representing a single component. For more information, see Application architecture.
