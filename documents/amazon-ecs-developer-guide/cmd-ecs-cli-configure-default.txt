ecs-cli configure default
Sets the cluster configuration to be read from by default.
Note
Unlike the AWS CLI, the Amazon ECS CLI does not expect or require that the default configuration be named default. The name of a configuration does not determine whether it is default.
Important
Some features described might only be available with the latest version of the Amazon ECS CLI. For more information about obtaining the latest version, see Installing the Amazon ECS CLI.
