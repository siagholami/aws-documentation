Using CloudWatch metrics to monitor Elastic Graphics
You can monitor your Elastic Graphics accelerator using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects metrics about your accelerator performance. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your service is performing.
By default, Elastic Graphics accelerators send metric data to CloudWatch in 5-minute periods.
For more information about Amazon CloudWatch, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Elastic Graphics metrics
The AWS/ElasticGPUs namespace includes the following metrics for Elastic Graphics.



Metric
Description




GPUConnectivityCheckFailed
Reports whether connectivity to the Elastic Graphics accelerator is active or has failed. A value of zero (0) indicates that the connection is active. A value of one (1) indicates a connectivity failure. Units: Count


GPUHealthCheckFailed
Reports whether the Elastic Graphics accelerator has passed a status health check in the last minute. A value of zero (0) indicates that the status check passed. A value of one (1) indicates a status check failure. Units: Count


GPUMemoryUtilization
The GPU memory used. Units: MiB



Elastic Graphics dimensions
You can filter the metrics data for your Elastic Graphics accelerators using the following dimensions.



Dimension
Description




EGPUId
Filters the data by the Elastic Graphics accelerator.


InstanceId
Filters the data by the instance to which the Elastic Graphics accelerator is attached.



Viewing CloudWatch metrics for Elastic Graphics
Metrics are grouped first by the service namespace, and then by the supported dimensions. You can use the following procedures to view the metrics for your Elastic Graphics accelerators.
To view Elastic Graphics metrics using the CloudWatch console


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


If necessary, change the Region. From the navigation bar, select the Region where your Elastic Graphics accelerator resides. For more information, see Regions and Endpoints.


In the navigation pane, choose Metrics.


For All metrics, select Elastic Graphics, Elastic Graphics Metrics.


To view Elastic Graphics metrics (AWS CLI)
Use the following list-metrics command:
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/ElasticGPUs"
Creating CloudWatch alarms to monitor Elastic Graphics
You can create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an Amazon SNS message when the alarm changes state. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period you specify, and sends a notification to an Amazon SNS topic based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. 
For example, you can create an alarm that monitors the health of an Elastic Graphics accelerator and sends a notification when the graphics accelerator fails a status health check for three consecutive 5-minute periods.
To create an alarm for an Elastic Graphics accelerator health status


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Alarms, Create Alarm.


Choose Select metric, Elastic Graphics, Elastic Graphics Metrics.


Select the GPUHealthCheckFailed metric and choose Select metric.


Configure the alarm as follows:


For Alarm details, type a name and description for your alarm. For Whenever, choose >= and type 1.


For Actions, select an existing notification list or choose New list. 


Choose Create Alarm.
