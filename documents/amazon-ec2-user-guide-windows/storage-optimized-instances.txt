Storage optimized instances
Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications.
D2 instances
These instances are well suited for the following:
 Massive parallel processing (MPP) data warehouse
 MapReduce and Hadoop distributed computing
 Log or data processing applications
H1 instances
These instances are well suited for the following:
 Data-intensive workloads such as MapReduce and distributed file systems
 Applications requiring sequential access to large amounts of data on direct-attached instance storage
 Applications that require high-throughput access to large quantities of data
I3 and I3en instances
These instances are well suited for the following:
 High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
 Relational databases
 NoSQL databases
 Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
 Data warehousing applications
 Distributed file systems
Bare metal instances provide your applications with direct access to physical resources of the host server, such as processors and memory. These instances are well suited for the following:
 Workloads that require access to low-level hardware features (for example, Intel VT) that are not available or fully supported in virtualized environments
 Applications that require a non-virtualized environment for licensing or support

Hardware specifications
The primary data storage for D2 instances is HDD instance store volumes. The primary data storage for I3 and I3en instances is non-volatile memory express (NVMe) SSD instance store volumes.
Instance store volumes persist only for the life of the instance. When you stop or terminate an instance, the applications and data in its instance store volumes are erased. We recommend that you regularly back up or replicate important data in your instance store volumes. For more information, see Amazon EC2 instance store and SSD instance store volumes.

Instance performance
For instances with NVMe instance store volumes, be sure to use the AWS NVMe driver. For more information, see AWS NVMe drivers for Windows instances.
EBS-optimized instances enable you to get consistently high performance for your EBS volumes by eliminating contention between Amazon EBS I/O and other network traffic from your instance. Some storage optimized instances are EBS-optimized by default at no additional cost. For more information, see Amazon EBS–optimized instances.
Network performance
You can enable enhanced networking on supported instance types to provide lower latencies, lower network jitter, and higher packet-per-second (PPS) performance. Most applications do not consistently need a high level of network performance, but can benefit from access to increased bandwidth when they send or receive data. For more information, see Enhanced networking on Windows.

† These instances use a network I/O credit mechanism to allocate network bandwidth to instances based on average bandwidth utilization. They accrue credits when their bandwidth is below their baseline bandwidth, and can use these credits when they perform network data transfers. For more information, open a support case and ask about baseline bandwidth for the specific instance types that you are interested in.
SSD I/O performance
If you use all the SSD-based instance store volumes available to your instance, you get the IOPS (4,096 byte block size) performance listed in the following table (at queue depth saturation). Otherwise, you get lower IOPS performance.

* For these instances, you can get up to the specified performance.
As you fill your SSD-based instance store volumes, the I/O performance that you get decreases. This is due to the extra work that the SSD controller must do to find available space, rewrite existing data, and erase unused space so that it can be rewritten. This process of garbage collection results in internal write amplification to the SSD, expressed as the ratio of SSD write operations to user write operations. This decrease in performance is even larger if the write operations are not in multiples of 4,096 bytes or not aligned to a 4,096-byte boundary. If you write a smaller amount of bytes or bytes that are not aligned, the SSD controller must read the surrounding data and store the result in a new location. This pattern results in significantly increased write amplification, increased latency, and dramatically reduced I/O performance.
SSD controllers can use several strategies to reduce the impact of write amplification. One such strategy is to reserve space in the SSD instance storage so that the controller can more efficiently manage the space available for write operations. This is called over-provisioning. The SSD-based instance store volumes provided to an instance don't have any space reserved for over-provisioning. To reduce write amplification, we recommend that you leave 10% of the volume unpartitioned so that the SSD controller can use it for over-provisioning. This decreases the storage that you can use, but increases performance even if the disk is close to full capacity.
For instance store volumes that support TRIM, you can use the TRIM command to notify the SSD controller whenever you no longer need data that you've written. This provides the controller with more free space, which can reduce write amplification and increase performance. For more information, see Instance store volume TRIM support.

Release notes

You must launch storage optimized instances using an HVM AMI. 
Instances built on the Nitro System have the following requirements:
NVMe drivers must be installed
Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) drivers must be installed

The current AWS Windows AMIs meet these requirements.
 Launching a bare metal instance boots the underlying server, which includes verifying all hardware and firmware components. This means that it can take 20 minutes from the time the instance enters the running state until it becomes available over the network.
 To attach or detach EBS volumes or secondary network interfaces from a bare metal instance requires PCIe native hotplug support.
 Bare metal instances use a PCI-based serial device rather than an I/O port-based serial device. The upstream Linux kernel and the latest Amazon Linux AMIs support this device. Bare metal instances also provide an ACPI SPCR table to enable the system to automatically use the PCI-based serial device. The latest Windows AMIs automatically use the PCI-based serial device.
 There is a limit on the total number of instances that you can launch in a Region, and there are additional limits on some instance types. For more information, see How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2? in the Amazon EC2 FAQ.
