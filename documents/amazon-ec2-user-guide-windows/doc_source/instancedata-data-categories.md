# Instance metadata categories<a name="instancedata-data-categories"></a>

The following table lists the categories of instance metadata\.

**Note**  
When Amazon EC2 releases a new instance metadata category, the instance metadata for the new category might not be available for existing instances\. To ensure that the instance metadata is available for an existing instance, you need to [stop and then start](Stop_Start.md) the instance\.

**Important**  
Some of the category names in the following table are placeholders for data that is unique to your instance\. For example, *mac* represents the MAC address for the network interface\. You must replace the placeholders with the actual values\.


| Data | Description | Release date | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| ami\-id  | The AMI ID used to launch the instance\. | Version 1\.0 | 
| ami\-launch\-index  | If you started more than one instance at the same time, this value indicates the order in which the instance was launched\. The value of the first instance launched is 0\. | Version 1\.0 | 
| ami\-manifest\-path  | The path to the AMI manifest file in Amazon S3\. If you used an Amazon EBS\-backed AMI to launch the instance, the returned result is unknown\. | Version 1\.0 | 
| ancestor\-ami\-ids  | The AMI IDs of any instances that were rebundled to create this AMI\. This value will only exist if the AMI manifest file contained an ancestor\-amis key\. | 2007\-10\-10 | 
| block\-device\-mapping/ami  | The virtual device that contains the root/boot file system\. | 2007\-12\-15 | 
| block\-device\-mapping/ebsN  | The virtual devices associated with any Amazon EBS volumes\. Amazon EBS volumes are only available in metadata if they were present at launch time or when the instance was last started\.

| block\-device\-mapping/ephemeralN  | The virtual devices for any non\-NVMe instance store volumes\. The N indicates the index of each volume\. The number of instance store volumes in the block device mapping might not match the actual number of instance store volumes for the instance\. The instance type determines the number of instance store volumes that are available to an instance\. If the number of instance store volumes in a block device mapping exceeds the number available to an instance, the additional instance store volumes are ignored\. | 2007\-12\-15 |
