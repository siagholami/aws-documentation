# Attaching an Amazon EBS volume to an instance<a name="ebs-attaching-volume"></a>

You can attach an available EBS volume to one or more of your instances that is in the same Availability Zone as the volume\.

**Prerequisites**
+ Determine how many volumes you can attach to your instance\. For more information, see [Instance volume limits](volume_limits.md)\.
+ If a volume is encrypted, it can only be attached to an instance that supports Amazon EBS encryption\. For more information, see [Supported instance types](EBSEncryption.md#EBSEncryption_supported_instances)\.
+ If a volume has an AWS Marketplace product code:
  + The volume can only be attached to a stopped instance\.
  + You must be subscribed to the AWS Marketplace code that is on the volume\.
  + The configuration \(instance type, operating system\) of the instance must support that specific AWS Marketplace code\. For example, you cannot take a volume from a Windows instance and attach it to a Linux instance\.
  + AWS Marketplace product codes are copied from the volume to the instance\.
