For more information about the hardware specifications for each Amazon EC2 instance type, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)\.

For more information about specifying CPU options, see [Optimizing CPU options](instance-optimize-cpu.md)\.

## Memory performance<a name="memory-perf"></a>

X1 instances include Intel Scalable M​​emory Buffers, providing 300 GiB/s of sustainable memory\-read bandwidth and 140 GiB/s of sustainable memory\-write bandwidth\.

For more information about how much RAM can be enabled for memory optimized instances, see [Hardware specifications](#memory-instances-hardware)\.

Memory optimized instances have high memory and require 64\-bit HVM AMIs to take advantage of that capacity\. HVM AMIs provide superior performance in comparison to paravirtual \(PV\) AMIs on memory optimized instances\. \.

## Instance performance<a name="memory-compute-perf"></a>

Memory optimized instances enable increased cryptographic performance through the latest Intel AES\-NI feature, support Intel Transactional Synchronization Extensions \(TSX\) to boost the performance of in\-memory transactional data processing, and support Advanced Vector Extensions 2 \(Intel AVX2\) processor instructions to expand most integer commands to 256 bits\.

## Network performance<a name="memory-network-perf"></a>

You can enable enhanced networking on supported instance types to provide lower latencies, lower network jitter, and higher packet\-per\-second \(PPS\) performance\. Most applications do not consistently need a high level of network performance, but can benefit from access to increased bandwidth when they send or receive data\. For more information, see [Enhanced networking on Windows](enhanced-networking.md)\.

The following is a summary of network performance for memory optimized instances that support enhanced networking\.


| Instance type | Network performance | Enhanced networking | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  r4\.4xlarge and smaller \| r5\.4xlarge and smaller \| r5a\.8xlarge and smaller \| r5ad\.8xlarge and smaller \| r5d\.4xlarge and smaller \| x1e\.8large and smaller \| z1d\.3xlarge and smaller  | Up to 10 Gbps † | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) |

|  r5dn\.24xlarge \| r5n\.24xlarge \| u\-6tb1\.metal \* \| u\-9tb1\.metal \* \| u\-12tb1\.metal \* \| u\-18tb1\.metal \| u\-24tb1\.metal  | 100 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 

\* Instances of this type launched after March 12, 2020 provide network performance of 100 Gbps\. Instances of this type launched before March 12, 2020 might only provide network performance of 25 Gbps\. To ensure that instances launched before March 12, 2020 have a network performance of 100 Gbps, contact your account team to upgrade your instance at no additional cost\.

† These instances use a network I/O credit mechanism to allocate network bandwidth to instances based on average bandwidth utilization\. They accrue credits when their bandwidth is below their baseline bandwidth, and can use these credits when they perform network data transfers\. For more information, open a support case and ask about baseline bandwidth for the specific instance types that you are interested in\.

## SSD I/O performance<a name="instances-ssd-perf"></a>

If you use all the SSD\-based instance store volumes available to your instance, you get the IOPS \(4,096 byte block size\) performance listed in the following table \(at queue depth saturation\)\. Otherwise, you get lower IOPS performance\.

\* For these instances, you can get up to the specified performance\.

As you fill the SSD\-based instance store volumes for your instance, the number of write IOPS that you can achieve decreases\. This is due to the extra work the SSD controller must do to find available space, rewrite existing data, and erase unused space so that it can be rewritten\. This process of garbage collection results in internal write amplification to the SSD, expressed as the ratio of SSD write operations to user write operations\. This decrease in performance is even larger if the write operations are not in multiples of 4,096 bytes or not aligned to a 4,096\-byte boundary\. If you write a smaller amount of bytes or bytes that are not aligned, the SSD controller must read the surrounding data and store the result in a new location\. This pattern results in significantly increased write amplification, increased latency, and dramatically reduced I/O performance\.

SSD controllers can use several strategies to reduce the impact of write amplification\. One such strategy is to reserve space in the SSD instance storage so that the controller can more efficiently manage the space available for write operations\. This is called *over\-provisioning*\. The SSD\-based instance store volumes provided to an instance don't have any space reserved for over\-provisioning\. To reduce write amplification, we recommend that you leave 10% of the volume unpartitioned so that the SSD controller can use it for over\-provisioning\. This decreases the storage that you can use, but increases performance even if the disk is close to full capacity\.

For instance store volumes that support TRIM, you can use the TRIM command to notify the SSD controller whenever you no longer need data that you've written\. This provides the controller with more free space, which can reduce write amplification and increase performance\. For more information, see [Instance store volume TRIM support](ssd-instance-store.md#InstanceStoreTrimSupport)\.

For more information, see the following:
+ [Amazon EBS and NVMe on Windows instances](nvme-ebs-volumes.md)
+ [Amazon EC2 instance store](InstanceStorage.md)
+ [Placement groups](placement-groups.md)

## High availability and reliability \(X1\)<a name="x1-windows-high-avail"></a>

X1 instances support Single Device Data Correction \(SDDC \+1\), which detects and corrects multi\-bit errors\. SDDC \+1 uses error checking and correction code to identify and disable a failed single DRAM device\.

In addition, you can implement high availability \(HA\) and disaster recovery \(DR\) solutions to meet recovery point objective \(RPO\), recovery time objective \(RTO\), and cost requirements by leveraging [Amazon CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and [Recover your instance](ec2-instance-recover.md)\. 

If you run an SAP HANA production environment, you also have the option of using HANA System Replication \(HSR\) on X1 instances\. For more information about architecting HA and DR solutions on X1 instances, see [SAP HANA on the Amazon Web Services Cloud: Quick Start Reference Deployment](http://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/sap-hana/)\.

## Support for vCPUs<a name="high-cpu-support"></a>

Memory optimized instances provide a high number of vCPUs, which can cause launch issues with operating systems that have a lower vCPU limit\. We strongly recommend that you use the latest AMIs when you launch memory optimized instances\.

The following AMIs support launching memory optimized instances:
+ Amazon Linux 2 \(HVM\)
+ Amazon Linux AMI 2016\.03 \(HVM\) or later
+ Ubuntu Server 14\.04 LTS \(HVM\)
+ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7\.1 \(HVM\)
+ SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP1 \(HVM\)
+ Windows Server 2019
+ Windows Server 2016
+ Windows Server 2012 R2
+ Windows Server 2012
+ Windows Server 2008 R2 64\-bit
+ Windows Server 2008 SP2 64\-bit

## Release notes<a name="memory-instance-limits"></a>
+ R4 instances feature up to 64 vCPUs and are powered by two AWS\-customized Intel XEON processors based on E5\-2686v4 that feature high\-memory bandwidth and larger L3 caches to boost the performance of in\-memory applications\.
+ R5 and R5d instances feature a 3\.1 GHz Intel Xeon Platinum 8000 series processor from either the first generation \(Skylake\-SP\) or second generation \(Cascade Lake\)\.
+ R5a and R5ad instances feature a 2\.5 GHz AMD EPYC 7000 series processor\.
+ High memory instances \(`u-6tb1.metal`, `u-9tb1.metal`, and `u-12tb1.metal`\) are the first instances to be powered by an eight\-socket platform with the latest generation Intel Xeon Platinum 8176M \(Skylake\) processors that are optimized for mission\-critical enterprise workloads\. High Memory instances with 18 TB and 24 TB of memory \(`u-18tb1.metal` and `u-24tb1.metal`\) are the first instances powered by an 8\-socket platform with 2nd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable 8280L \(Cascade Lake\) processors\.
+ X1e and X1 instances feature up to 128 vCPUs and are powered by four Intel Xeon E7\-8880 v3 processors that feature high\-memory bandwidth and larger L3 caches to boost the performance of in\-memory applications\.
+ Instances built on the Nitro System have the following requirements:
  + [NVMe drivers](nvme-ebs-volumes.md) must be installed
  + [Elastic Network Adapter \(ENA\) drivers](enhanced-networking-ena.md) must be installed

  The current [AWS Windows AMIs](windows-ami-version-history.md) meet these requirements\.
+ Instances built on the Nitro System instances support a maximum of 28 attachments, including network interfaces, EBS volumes, and NVMe instance store volumes\. For more information, see [Nitro System volume limits](volume_limits.md#instance-type-volume-limits)\.
+ Launching a bare metal instance boots the underlying server, which includes verifying all hardware and firmware components\. This means that it can take 20 minutes from the time the instance enters the running state until it becomes available over the network\.
+ To attach or detach EBS volumes or secondary network interfaces from a bare metal instance requires PCIe native hotplug support\.
+ Bare metal instances use a PCI\-based serial device rather than an I/O port\-based serial device\. The upstream Linux kernel and the latest Amazon Linux AMIs support this device\. Bare metal instances also provide an ACPI SPCR table to enable the system to automatically use the PCI\-based serial device\. The latest Windows AMIs automatically use the PCI\-based serial device\.
+ You can't launch X1 instances using a Windows Server 2008 SP2 64\-bit AMI, except for `x1.16xlarge` instances\.
+ You can't launch X1e instances using a Windows Server 2008 SP2 64\-bit AMI\.
+ With earlier versions of the Windows Server 2008 R2 64\-bit AMI, you can't launch `r4.large` and `r4.4xlarge` instances\. If you experience this issue, update to the latest version of this AMI\.
+ There is a limit on the total number of instances that you can launch in a Region, and there are additional limits on some instance types\. For more information, see [How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2?](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_many_instances_can_I_run_in_Amazon_EC2) in the Amazon EC2 FAQ\.
