# Sharing an AMI with specific AWS accounts<a name="sharingamis-explicit"></a>

You can share an AMI with specific AWS accounts without making the AMI public\. All you need is the AWS account IDs\. You can only share AMIs that have unencrypted volumes and volumes that are encrypted with a customer managed CMK\. If you share an AMI with encrypted volumes, you must also share any CMKs used to encrypt them\. For more information, see [Sharing an Amazon EBS snapshot](ebs-modifying-snapshot-permissions.md)\. You cannot share an AMI that has volumes that are encrypted with a AWS managed CMK\.

AMIs are a regional resource\. Therefore, sharing an AMI makes it available in that Region\. To make an AMI available in a different Region, copy the AMI to the Region and then share it\. For more information, see [Copying an AMI](CopyingAMIs.md)\.

There is no limit to the number of AWS accounts with which an AMI can be shared\. User\-defined tags that you attach to a shared AMI are available only to your AWS account and not to the other accounts that the AMI is shared with\.

## Sharing an AMI \(console\)<a name="sharingamis-console"></a>

**To grant explicit launch permissions using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **AMIs**\.

1. Select your AMI in the list, and then choose **Actions**, **Modify Image Permissions**\.

1. Specify the AWS account number of the user with whom you want to share the AMI in the **AWS Account Number** field, then choose **Add Permission**\.

   To share this AMI with multiple users, repeat this step until you have added all the required users\. 

1. To allow create volume permissions for snapshots, select ** Add "create volume" permissions to the following associated snapshots when creating permissions\.** 
**Note**  
You do not need to share the Amazon EBS snapshots that an AMI references in order to share the AMI\. Only the AMI itself needs to be shared; the system automatically provides the instance access to the referenced Amazon EBS snapshots for the launch\. However, you do need to share any CMKs used to encrypt snapshots that the AMI references\. For more information, see [Sharing an Amazon EBS snapshot](ebs-modifying-snapshot-permissions.md)\.

1. Choose **Save** when you are done\.

1. \(Optional\) To view the AWS account IDs with which you have shared the AMI, select the AMI in the list, and choose the **Permissions** tab\. To find AMIs that are shared with you, see [Finding shared AMIs](usingsharedamis-finding.md)\.

## Sharing an AMI \(Tools for Windows PowerShell\)<a name="sharing-amis-powershell"></a>

Use the [Edit\-EC2ImageAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2ImageAttribute.html) command \(Tools for Windows PowerShell\) to share an AMI as shown in the following examples\.

**To grant explicit launch permissions**  
The following command grants launch permissions for the specified AMI to the specified AWS account\.

```
PS C:\> Edit-EC2ImageAttribute -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 -Attribute launchPermission -OperationType add -UserId "123456789012"
```

The following command grants create volume permission for a snapshot\.

```
PS C:\> Edit-EC2SnapshotAttribute -SnapshotId snap-1234567890abcdef0 -Attribute CreateVolumePermission -OperationType add -UserId 123456789012
```

**Note**  
You do not need to share the Amazon EBS snapshots that an AMI references in order to share the AMI\. Only the AMI itself needs to be shared; the system automatically provides the instance access to the referenced Amazon EBS snapshots for the launch\. However, you do need to share any CMKs used to encrypt snapshots that the AMI references\. For more information, see [Sharing an Amazon EBS snapshot](ebs-modifying-snapshot-permissions.md)\.

**To remove launch permissions for an account**  
The following command removes launch permissions for the specified AMI from the specified AWS account:

```
PS C:\> Edit-EC2ImageAttribute -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 -Attribute launchPermission -OperationType remove -UserId "123456789012"
```

The following command removes create volume permission for a snapshot\.

```
PS C:\> Edit-EC2SnapshotAttribute -SnapshotId snap-1234567890abcdef0 -Attribute CreateVolumePermission -OperationTtype remove -UserId 123456789012
```

**To remove all launch permissions**  
The following command removes all public and explicit launch permissions from the specified AMI\. Note that the owner of the AMI always has launch permissions and is therefore unaffected by this command\.

```
PS C:\> Reset-EC2ImageAttribute -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 -Attribute launchPermission
```

## Sharing an AMI \(AWS CLI\)<a name="sharingamis-aws-cli"></a>

Use the [modify\-image\-attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-image-attribute.html) command \(AWS CLI\) to share an AMI as shown in the following examples\.

**To grant explicit launch permissions**  
The following command grants launch permissions for the specified AMI to the specified AWS account\.

```
aws ec2 modify-image-attribute \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --launch-permission "Add=[{UserId=123456789012}]"
```

The following command grants create volume permission for a snapshot\.

```
aws ec2 modify-snapshot-attribute \
    --snapshot-id snap-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --attribute createVolumePermission \
    --operation-type add \
    --user-ids 123456789012
```

**Note**  
You do not need to share the Amazon EBS snapshots that an AMI references in order to share the AMI\. Only the AMI itself needs to be shared; the system automatically provides the instance access to the referenced Amazon EBS snapshots for the launch\. However, you do need to share any CMKs used to encrypt snapshots that the AMI references\. For more information, see [Sharing an Amazon EBS snapshot](ebs-modifying-snapshot-permissions.md)\.

**To remove launch permissions for an account**  
The following command removes launch permissions for the specified AMI from the specified AWS account:

```
aws ec2 modify-image-attribute \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --launch-permission "Remove=[{UserId=123456789012}]"
```

The following command removes create volume permission for a snapshot\.

```
aws ec2 modify-snapshot-attribute \
    --snapshot-id snap-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --attribute createVolumePermission \
    --operation-type remove \
    --user-ids 123456789012
```

**To remove all launch permissions**  
The following command removes all public and explicit launch permissions from the specified AMI\. Note that the owner of the AMI always has launch permissions and is therefore unaffected by this command\.

```
aws ec2 reset-image-attribute \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --attribute launchPermission
```
