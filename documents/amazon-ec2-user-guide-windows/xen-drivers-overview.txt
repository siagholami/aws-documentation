Paravirtual Drivers for Windows Instances
Windows AMIs contain a set of drivers to permit access to virtualized hardware. These drivers are used by Amazon EC2 to map instance store and Amazon EBS volumes to their devices. The following table shows key differences between the different drivers.




RedHat PV
Citrix PV
AWS PV




Instance type
Not supported for all instance types. If you specify an unsupported instance type, the instance is impaired.
Supported for all instance types.
Supported for all instance types.


Attached volumes
Supports up to 16 attached volumes.
Supports more than 16 attached volumes.
Supports more than 16 attached volumes.


Network
The driver has known issues where the network connection resets under high loads; for example, fast FTP file transfers.

The driver automatically configures jumbo frames on the network adapter when on a compatible instance type. When the instance is in a cluster placement group, this offers better network performance between instances in the cluster placement group.



The following list shows which PV drivers you should run on each version of Windows Server on Amazon EC2.
 Windows Server 2019: AWS PV
 Windows Server 2016: AWS PV
 Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2: AWS PV
 Windows Server 2008 R2: AWS PV 
 Windows Server 2008: Citrix PV 5.9

AWS PV Drivers
The AWS PV drivers are stored in the %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\Xentools directory. This directory also contains public symbols and a command line tool, xenstore_client.exe, that enables you to access entries in XenStore. For example, the following PowerShell command returns the current time from the Hypervisor:
PS C:\> [DateTime]::FromFileTimeUTC((gwmi -n root\wmi -cl AWSXenStoreBase).XenTime).ToString("hh:mm:ss")
11:17:00
The AWS PV driver components are listed in the Windows registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services. These driver components are as follows: xenbus, xeniface, xennet, xenvbd, and xenvif.
AWS PV drivers also have a Windows service named LiteAgent, which runs in user-mode. It handles tasks such as shutdown and restart events from AWS APIs on Xen generation instances. You can access and manage services by running Services.msc from the command line. When running on Nitro generation instances, the AWS PV drivers are not used and the LiteAgent service will self-stop starting with driver version 8.2.4. Updating to the latest AWS PV driver also updates the LiteAgent and improves reliability on all instance generations.
Installing the Latest AWS PV Drivers
Amazon Windows AMIs contain a set of drivers to permit access to virtualized hardware. These drivers are used by Amazon EC2 to map instance store and Amazon EBS volumes to their devices. We recommend that you install the latest drivers to improve stability and performance of your EC2 Windows instances.
Installation Options
 You can use AWS Systems Manager to automatically update the PV drivers. For more information, see Walkthrough: Automatically Update PV Drivers on EC2 Windows Instances (Console) in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
 You can download the setup package and run the install program manually. For information about downloading and installing the AWS PV drivers, or if you are upgrading a domain controller, see Upgrade Windows Server Instances (AWS PV Upgrade). 
AWS PV Driver Package History

8.2.3
Bug fixes and performance improvements. Report EBS volume ID as disk serial number for EBS volumes. This enables cluster scenarios such as S2D.
29 May 2018


8.2.1
Network and storage performance improvements plus multiple robustness fixes. To verify that this version has been installed, refer to the following Windows registry value: HKLM\Software\Amazon\PVDriver\Version 8.2.1.
8 March 2018


7.4.6
Stability fixes to make AWS PV drivers more resilient.
26 April 2017


7.4.3
Added support for Windows Server 2016. Stability fixes for all supported Windows OS versions. *AWS PV driver version 7.4.3's signature expires on March 29, 2019. We recommend updating to the latest AWS PV driver.
18 Nov 2016


7.4.2
Stability fixes for support of X1 instance type.
2 Aug 2016


7.4.1
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
12 July 2016


7.3.2
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
24 June 2015


7.3.1
TRIM update: Fix related to TRIM requests. This fix stabilizes instances and improves instance performance when managing large numbers of TRIM requests.



7.3.0
TRIM support: The AWS PV driver now sends TRIM requests to the hypervisor. Ephemeral disks will properly process TRIM requests given the underlying storage supports TRIM (SSD). Note that EBS-based storage does not support TRIM as of March 2015.



7.2.5
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]



7.2.4
Device ID persistence: This driver fix masks the platform PCI device ID and forces the system to always surface the same device ID, even if the instance is moved. More generally, the fix affects how the hypervisor surfaces virtual devices. The fix also includes modifications to the co-installer for the AWS PV drivers so the system persists mapped virtual devices.



7.2.2
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]



7.2.1
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]



7.2.0
Base: The AWS PV base version.




Citrix PV Drivers
The Citrix PV drivers are stored in the %ProgramFiles%\Citrix\XenTools (32-bit instances) or %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Citrix\XenTools (64-bit instances) directory.
The Citrix PV driver components are listed in the Windows registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services. These driver components are as follows: xenevtchn, xeniface, xennet, Xennet6, xensvc, xenvbd, and xenvif.
Citrix also has a driver component named XenGuestAgent, which runs as a Windows service. It handles tasks such as shutdown and restart events from the API. You can access and manage services by running Services.msc from the command line.
If you are encountering networking errors while performing certain workloads, you may need to disable the TCP offloading feature for the Citrix PV driver. For more information, see TCP Offloading.
RedHat PV Drivers
RedHat drivers are supported for legacy instances, but are not recommended on newer instances with more than 12GB of RAM due to driver limitations. Instances with more than 12GB of RAM running RedHat drivers can fail to boot and become inaccessible. We recommend upgrading RedHat drivers to Citrix PV drivers, and then upgrade Citrix PV drivers to AWS PV drivers.
The source files for the RedHat drivers are in the %ProgramFiles%\RedHat (32-bit instances) or %ProgramFiles(x86)%\RedHat (64-bit instances) directory. The two drivers are rhelnet, the RedHat Paravirtualized network driver, and rhelscsi, the RedHat SCSI miniport driver.
