Working with instance user data
When working with instance user data, keep the following in mind:
 User data must be base64-encoded. The Amazon EC2 console can perform the base64-encoding for you or accept base64-encoded input.
 User data is limited to 16 KB, in raw form, before it is base64-encoded. The size of a string of length n after base64-encoding is ceil(n/3)*4.
 User data must be base64-decoded when you retrieve it. If you retrieve the data using instance metadata or the console, it's decoded for you automatically.
 User data is treated as opaque data: what you give is what you get back. It is up to the instance to be able to interpret it.
 If you stop an instance, modify its user data, and start the instance, the updated user data is not executed automatically when you start the instance. However, you can configure settings so that updated user data scripts are executed one time when you start the instance or every time you reboot or start the instance.
Specify instance user data at launch
You can specify user data when you launch an instance. You can specify that the user data is executed one time at launch, or every time you reboot or start the instance. For more information, see Running commands on your Windows instance at launch.
Modify instance user data
You can modify user data for an instance in the stopped state if the root volume is an EBS volume. For more information, see View and update the instance user data.
Retrieve instance user data
To retrieve user data from within a running instance, use the following URI.
http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
A request for user data returns the data as it is (content type application/octet-stream). 
This example returns user data that was provided as comma-separated text.
