Using Amazon EFS with Amazon EC2
Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2. You can create an EFS file system and configure your instances to mount the file system. You can use an EFS file system as a common data source for workloads and applications running on multiple instances. For more information, see Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances and the Amazon Elastic File System product page.

Amazon EFS is not supported on Windows instances.
