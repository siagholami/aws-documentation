Sign Up for AWS
When you sign up for Amazon Web Services, your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS. You are charged only for the services that you use.
If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next task. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one.
To sign up for an AWS account


Open https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.


Follow the online instructions.


Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.
Set Up Access for Users
The first time that you use Systems Manager, you must provide AWS credentials. To enable multiple users to access the same AWS account using unique credentials and permissions, create an IAM user for each user. You can create one or more groups with policies that grant permissions to perform limited tasks. Then you can create one or more IAM users, and add each user to the appropriate group.
To create an Administrators group


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Groups and then choose Create New Group. 


In the Group Name box, specify Administrators and then choose Next Step.


On the Attach Policy page, select the AdministratorAccess AWS managed policy.


Choose Next Step and then choose Create Group.


To create a group with limited access to Amazon EC2


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Groups and then choose Create New Group. 


In the Group Name box, specify a meaningful name for the group and then choose Next Step.


On the Attach Policy page, do not select an AWS managed policy â€” choose Next Step, and then choose Create Group.


Choose the name of the group you've just created. On the Permissions tab, choose Inline Policies, and then click here.


Select the Custom Policy radio button and then choose Select.


Enter a name for the policy and a policy document that grants limited access to Amazon EC2, and then choose Apply Policy. For example, you can specify one of the following custom policies.


Grant users in this group permission to view information about EC2 instances only

     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",

         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }

           "ec2:Describe*", "ec2:CreateKeyPair",
           "ec2:CreateTags", "ec2:DeleteTags",
           "ec2:RunInstances", "ec2:GetPasswordData",
           "ec2:RebootInstances", "ec2:StartInstances", 
           "ec2:StopInstances", "ec2:TerminateInstances"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
Grant users in this group permission to import a VM to Amazon EC2
{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "s3:CreateBucket",
           "s3:DeleteBucket", "s3:DeleteObject",
           "s3:GetBucketLocation", "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:ListBucket", "s3:PutObject",
           "ec2:DescribeTags", "ec2:CancelConversionTask", 
           "ec2:DescribeConversionTasks", "ec2:DescribeInstanceAttribute",
           "ec2:CreateImage", "ec2:AttachVolume",
           "ec2:ImportInstance", "ec2:ImportVolume",
           "dynamodb:DescribeTable", "dynamodb:CreateTable",
           "dynamodb:Scan", "dynamodb:PutItem", "dynamodb:UpdateItem"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
To create an IAM user, get the user's AWS credentials, and grant the user permissions


In the navigation pane, choose Users and then choose Add user. 


Enter a user name. 


Select the type of access this set of users will have. Select Programmatic access and AWS Management Console access if this user must also access the AWS Management Console.


For Console password type, choose one of the following:
    Autogenerated password. Each user gets a randomly generated password that meets the current password policy in effect (if any). You can view or download the passwords when you get to the Final page.
    Custom password. Each user is assigned the password that you type in the box.


Choose Next: Permissions .


On the Set permissions page, choose Add user to group. Select the appropriate group.


Choose Next: Review, then Create user.


To view the users' access keys (access key IDs and secret access keys), choose Show next to each password and secret access key that you want to see. To save the access keys, choose Download .csv and then save the file to a safe location.
Note
You cannot retrieve the secret access key after you complete this step; if you misplace it you must create a new one.


Choose Close.


Deploy the Add-In
Add-ins for System Center VMM are distributed as .zip files. To deploy the add-in, use the following procedure.
To deploy the add-in


From your instance, go to AWS Systems Manager for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager and click SCVMM. Save the aws-systems-manager-1.5.zip file to your instance.


Open the VMM console.


In the navigation pane, click Settings and then click Console Add-Ins.


On the ribbon, click Import Console Add-in.


On the Select an Add-in page, click Browse and select the aws-systems-manager-1.5.zip file for the add-in that you downloaded.


Ignore any warnings that there are assemblies in the add-in that are not signed by a trusted authority. Select Continue installing this add-in anyway and then click Next.


On the Summary page, click Finish.


When the add-in is imported, the status of the job is Completed. You can close the Jobs window.


Provide Your AWS Credentials
When you use the Systems Manager for the first time, you must provide your AWS credentials. Your access keys identify you to AWS. There are two types of access keys: access key IDs (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and secret access keys (for example, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY). You should have stored your access keys in a safe place when you received them.
To provide your AWS credentials


Open the VMM console.


In the navigation pane, click VMs and Services.


On the ribbon, click Amazon EC2.


On the Credentials tab, specify your AWS credentials, select a default region, and then click Save.



To change these credentials at any time, click Configuration.
