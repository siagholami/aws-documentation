Guidelines for shared Windows AMIs
Use the following guidelines to reduce the attack surface and improve the reliability of the AMIs you create. 
 No list of security guidelines can be exhaustive. Build your shared AMIs carefully and take time to consider where you might expose sensitive data.
 Develop a repeatable process for building, updating, and republishing AMIs.
 Build AMIs using the most up-to-date operating systems, packages, and software.
 Download and install the latest version of the EC2Config service. For more information about installing this service, see Installing the Latest Version of EC2Config. 
 Verify that Ec2SetPassword, Ec2WindowsActivate and Ec2HandleUserData are enabled.
 Verify that no guest accounts or Remote Desktop user accounts are present.
 Disable or remove unnecessary services and programs to reduce the attack surface of your AMI.
 Remove instance credentials, such as your key pair, from the AMI (if you saved them on the AMI). Store the credentials in a safe location.
 Ensure that the administrator password and passwords on any other accounts are set to an appropriate value for sharing. These passwords are available for anyone who launches your shared AMI.
 Test your AMI before you share it.
