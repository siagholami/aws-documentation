Prerequisites

Ensure that your VM is ready. For more information, see Prepare Your VM in the * VM Import/Export User Guide*.
In AWS Systems Manager, click Configuration, select the VM Import tab, and review the following settings:
S3 bucket prefix: We create a bucket for disk images to be uploaded before they are imported. The name of the bucket starts with the prefix listed here and includes the Region (for example, us-east-2). To delete the disk images after they are imported, select Clean up S3 bucket after import.
VM image export path: A location for the disk images exported from the VM. To delete the disk images after they are imported, select Clean up export path after import.
Alternate Hyper-V PowerShell module path: The location of the Hyper-V PowerShell module, if it's not installed in the standard location. For more information, see Installing the Hyper-V Management Tools in the Microsoft TechNet Library.

Importing Your Virtual Machine
The permissions that you've been granted by your administrator determine whether you can import HyperV Windows virtual machines from SCVMM to AWS.
To import your virtual machine


Open SCVMM.


On the ribbon, click VMs. Select your virtual machine from the list.


On the ribbon, click Import VM to Amazon EC2.


Complete the Import Virtual Machine dialog box as follows:


Select a Region for the instance. By default, we select the Region that you configured as your default Region.


Select an instance type for the instance. First, select one of the latest instance families from Family, and then select an instance type from Instance type. To include previous generation instance families in the list, select Show previous generations. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Instances and Previous Generation Instances.


Select a VPC from Network (VPC). Note that this list includes all VPCs for the region, including VPCs created using the Amazon VPC console and the default VPC (if it exists). If you have a default VPC in this region, we select it by default. If the text is "There is no VPC available for launch or import operations in this region", then you must create a VPC in this region using the Amazon VPC console.


Select a subnet from Subnet. Note that this list includes all subnets for the selected VPC, including any default subnets. If this list is empty, you must add a subnet to the VPC using the Amazon VPC console, or select a different VPC. Otherwise, we select a subnet for you.



Click Import. If you haven't specified the required information in the VM Import tab, you'll receive an error asking you to provide the required information. Otherwise, you'll receive confirmation that the import task has started. Click Close.


Checking the Import Task Status
The import task can take several hours to complete. To view the current status, open AWS System Manager and click Notifications.
You'll receive the following notifications as the import task progresses:
 Import VM: Created Import VM Task
 Import VM: Export VM Disk Image Done
 Import VM: Upload to S3
 Import VM: Image Conversion Starting
 Import VM: Image Conversion Done
 Import VM: Import Complete
Note that you'll receive the Import VM: Upload to S3, Import VM: Image Conversion Starting, and Import VM: Image Conversion Done notifications for each disk image converted.
If the import task fails, you'll receive the notification Import VM: Import Failed. For more information about troubleshooting issues with import tasks, see Errors Importing a VM.
Backing Up Your Imported Instance
After the import operation completes, the instance runs until it is terminated. If your instance is terminated, you can't connect to or recover the instance. To ensure that you can start a new instance with the same software as an imported instance if needed, create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the imported instance. For more information, see Create a custom Windows AMI.
