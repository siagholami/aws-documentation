Spot Fleet example configurations
The following examples show launch configurations that you can use with the request-spot-fleet command to create a Spot Fleet request. For more information, see Creating a Spot Fleet request.
Note
For Spot Fleet, you can't specify an network interface ID in a launch specification. Make sure you omit the NetworkInterfaceID parameter in your launch specification.

Launch a Spot Fleet with On-Demand capacity


Example 1: Launch Spot Instances using the lowest-priced Availability Zone or subnet in the Region
The following example specifies a single launch specification without an Availability Zone or subnet. The Spot Fleet launches the instances in the lowest-priced Availability Zone that has a default subnet. The price you pay does not exceed the On-Demand price.
{
  "TargetCapacity": 20,
  "IamFleetRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role",

          "KeyName": "my-key-pair",
          "SecurityGroups": [
              {
                  "GroupId": "sg-1a2b3c4d"
              }
          ],
          "InstanceType": "m3.medium",
          "IamInstanceProfile": {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/my-iam-role"
          }
      }
  ]
}
Example 2: Launch Spot Instances using the lowest-priced Availability Zone or subnet in a specified list
The following examples specify two launch specifications with different Availability Zones or subnets, but the same instance type and AMI.
Availability Zones
The Spot Fleet launches the instances in the default subnet of the lowest-priced Availability Zone that you specified.
{
  "TargetCapacity": 20,
  "IamFleetRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role",
  "LaunchSpecifications": [
      {
          "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
          "KeyName": "my-key-pair",
          "SecurityGroups": [
              {
                  "GroupId": "sg-1a2b3c4d"
              }
          ],
          "InstanceType": "m3.medium",
          "Placement": {
              "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2a, us-west-2b"
          },
          "IamInstanceProfile": {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/my-iam-role"
          }
      }
  ]
}
Subnets
You can specify default subnets or nondefault subnets, and the nondefault subnets can be from a default VPC or a nondefault VPC. The Spot service launches the instances in whichever subnet is in the lowest-priced Availability Zone.
You can't specify different subnets from the same Availability Zone in a Spot Fleet request.
{
  "TargetCapacity": 20,
  "IamFleetRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role",
  "LaunchSpecifications": [
      {
          "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
          "KeyName": "my-key-pair",
          "SecurityGroups": [
              {
                  "GroupId": "sg-1a2b3c4d"
              }
          ],
          "InstanceType": "m3.medium",
          "SubnetId": "subnet-a61dafcf, subnet-65ea5f08",
          "IamInstanceProfile": {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/my-iam-role"
          }
      }
  ]
}
If the instances are launched in a default VPC, they receive a public IPv4 address by default. If the instances are launched in a nondefault VPC, they do not receive a public IPv4 address by default. Use a network interface in the launch specification to assign a public IPv4 address to instances launched in a nondefault VPC. When you specify a network interface, you must include the subnet ID and security group ID using the network interface.

      {
          "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
          "KeyName": "my-key-pair",
          "InstanceType": "m3.medium",
          "NetworkInterfaces": [
              {

                  "Groups": [ "sg-1a2b3c4d" ],
                  "AssociatePublicIpAddress": true
              }

          }
      }
  ...
Example 3: Launch Spot Instances using the lowest-priced instance type in a specified list
The following examples specify two launch configurations with different instance types, but the same AMI and Availability Zone or subnet. The Spot Fleet launches the instances using the specified instance type with the lowest price.
Availability Zone
{
  "TargetCapacity": 20,
  "IamFleetRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role",

      {
          "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
          "SecurityGroups": [
              {
                  "GroupId": "sg-1a2b3c4d"
              }
          ],
          "InstanceType": "cc2.8xlarge",
          "Placement": {
            "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2b"
          }
      },

          ],
          "InstanceType": "r3.8xlarge",
          "Placement": {
              "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2b"
          }
      }
  ]
}
Subnet
{
  "TargetCapacity": 20,
  "IamFleetRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role",
  "LaunchSpecifications": [
      {
          "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
          "SecurityGroups": [
              {
                  "GroupId": "sg-1a2b3c4d"
              }
          ],

          "InstanceType": "r3.8xlarge",
          "SubnetId": "subnet-1a2b3c4d"
      }
  ]
}
Example 4. Override the price for the request
We recommended that you use the default maximum price, which is the On-Demand price. If you prefer, you can specify a maximum price for the fleet request and maximum prices for individual launch specifications.
The following examples specify a maximum price for the fleet request and maximum prices for two of the three launch specifications. The maximum price for the fleet request is used for any launch specification that does not specify a maximum price. The Spot Fleet launches the instances using the instance type with the lowest price.
Availability Zone
{
  "SpotPrice": "1.00",
  "TargetCapacity": 30,
  "IamFleetRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role",

              "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2b"
          }
      }
    ]
}
Subnet
{

          "SubnetId": "subnet-1a2b3c4d"
      }
  ]
}
Example 5: Launch a Spot Fleet using the diversified allocation strategy
The following example uses the diversified allocation strategy. The launch specifications have different instance types but the same AMI and Availability Zone or subnet. The Spot Fleet distributes the 30 instances across the three launch specifications, such that there are 10 instances of each type. For more information, see Allocation strategy for Spot Instances.
Availability Zone
{
  "SpotPrice": "0.70", 
  "TargetCapacity": 30,
  "AllocationStrategy": "diversified",
  "IamFleetRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role",
  "LaunchSpecifications": [
      {
          "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
          "InstanceType": "c4.2xlarge",
          "Placement": {
              "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2b"
          }
      },
      {
          "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
          "InstanceType": "m3.2xlarge",
          "Placement": {
              "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2b"
          }
      },
      {
          "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
          "InstanceType": "r3.2xlarge",
          "Placement": {
              "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2b"
          }
      }
  ]
}
Subnet
{
    "SpotPrice": "0.70", 
    "TargetCapacity": 30,
    "AllocationStrategy": "diversified",
    "IamFleetRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role",
    "LaunchSpecifications": [
        {
            "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
            "InstanceType": "c4.2xlarge",
            "SubnetId": "subnet-1a2b3c4d"
        },
        {
            "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
            "InstanceType": "m3.2xlarge",
            "SubnetId": "subnet-1a2b3c4d"
        },
        {
            "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
            "InstanceType": "r3.2xlarge",
            "SubnetId": "subnet-1a2b3c4d"
        }
    ]
}
A best practice to increase the chance that a spot request can be fulfilled by EC2 capacity in the event of an outage in one of the Availability Zones is to diversify across zones. For this scenario, include each Availability Zone available to you in the launch specification. And, instead of using the same subnet each time, use three unique subnets (each mapping to a different zone). 
Availability Zone
{
  "SpotPrice": "0.70", 
  "TargetCapacity": 30,
  "AllocationStrategy": "diversified",
  "IamFleetRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role",
  "LaunchSpecifications": [
      {
          "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
          "InstanceType": "c4.2xlarge",
          "Placement": {
              "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2a"
          }
      },
      {
          "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
          "InstanceType": "m3.2xlarge",
          "Placement": {
              "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2b"
          }
      },
      {
          "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
          "InstanceType": "r3.2xlarge",
          "Placement": {
              "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2c"
          }
      }
  ]
}

            "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",

        },
        {
            "ImageId": "ami-1a2b3c4d",
            "InstanceType": "r3.2xlarge",
            "SubnetId": "subnet-3a2b3c4d"
        }
    ]
}
Example 6: Launch a Spot Fleet using instance weighting
The following examples use instance weighting, which means that the price is per unit hour instead of per instance hour. Each launch configuration lists a different instance type and a different weight. The Spot Fleet selects the instance type with the lowest price per unit hour. The Spot Fleet calculates the number of Spot Instances to launch by dividing the target capacity by the instance weight. If the result isn't an integer, the Spot Fleet rounds it up to the next integer, so that the size of your fleet is not below its target capacity.
If the r3.2xlarge request is successful, Spot provisions 4 of these instances. Divide 20 by 6 for a total of 3.33 instances, then round up to 4 instances.
If the c3.xlarge request is successful, Spot provisions 7 of these instances. Divide 20 by 3 for a total of 6.66 instances, then round up to 7 instances.
For more information, see Spot Fleet instance weighting.

Example 7: Launch a Spot Fleet with On-Demand capacity
To ensure that you always have instance capacity, you can include a request for On-Demand capacity in your Spot Fleet request. If there is capacity, the On-Demand request is always fulfilled. The balance of the target capacity is fulfilled as Spot if there is capacity and availability.
The following example specifies the desired target capacity as 10, of which 5 must be On-Demand capacity. Spot capacity is not specified; it is implied in the balance of the target capacity minus the On-Demand capacity. Amazon EC2 launches 5 capacity units as On-Demand, and 5 capacity units (10-5=5) as Spot if there is available Amazon EC2 capacity and availability. 
For more information, see On-Demand in Spot Fleet.
