Step 4: Run the Add Monitoring Wizard
You can configure the AWS Management Pack to monitor a particular AWS account by using the Add Monitoring Wizard, which is available in the Authoring workspace of the Operations console. This wizard creates a management pack that contains the settings for the AWS account to monitor. You must run this wizard to monitor each AWS account. For example, if you want to monitor two AWS accounts, you must run the wizard twice.
System Center 2012
To run the Add Monitoring Wizard on System Center 2012 â€” Operations Manager


In the Operations console, on the Go menu, click Authoring.


In the Authoring workspace, expand the Management Pack Templates node, right-click Amazon Web Services, and then click Add Monitoring Wizard.


In the Add Monitoring Wizard, in the Select the monitoring type list, select Amazon Web Services, and then click Next.


On the General Properties page, in the Name box, enter a name (for example, "My AWS Resources"). In the Description box, enter a description. 


In the Select destination management pack list, select an existing management pack (or click New to create one) where you want to save the settings. Click Next.



By default, when you create a management pack object, disable a rule or monitor, or create an override, Operations Manager saves the setting to the default management pack. As a best practice, you should create a separate management pack for each sealed management pack that you want to customize, instead of saving your customized settings to the default management pack.


The AWS Management Pack automatically creates a resource pool and adds the management servers to it. To control server membership, make the following changes:


Click Administration on the Go menu.


Click the Resource Pools node.


Right-click the AWS Resource Pool in the Resource Pools pane and select Manual Membership.



Right-click the AWS Resource Pool in the Resource Pools pane and select Properties.


On the Pool Membership page, remove the management servers that should not monitor AWS resources.



After the AWS Management Pack is configured, it shows up as a sub-folder of the Amazon Web Services folder in the Monitoring workspace of the Operations console.



System Center 2007 R2
To run the Add Monitoring Wizard on System Center Operations Manager 2007


In the Operations console, on the Go menu, click Authoring.


In the Authoring workspace, expand the Management Pack Templates node, right-click Amazon Web Services, and then click Add Monitoring Wizard.


In the Add Monitoring Wizard, in the Select the monitoring type list, select Amazon Web Services, and then click Next.


On the General Properties page, in the Name box, enter a name (for example, "My AWS Resources"). In the Description box, enter a description. 


In the Select destination management pack drop-down list, select an existing management pack (or click New to create a new one) where you want to save the settings. Click Next.



By default, when you create a management pack object, disable a rule or monitor, or create an override, Operations Manager saves the setting to the default management pack. As a best practice, you should create a separate management pack for each sealed management pack that you want to customize, instead of saving your customized settings to the default management pack.


On the Watcher Node Configuration page, in the Watcher Node list, select an agent-managed computer to act as the watcher node.


In the Select AWS Run As account drop-down list, select the Run As account that you created earlier, and then click Create.


After the AWS Management Pack is configured, it first discovers the watcher node. To verify that the watcher node was discovered successfully, navigate to the Monitoring workspace in the Operations console. You should see a new Amazon Web Services folder and an Amazon Watcher Nodes subfolder under it. This subfolder displays the watcher nodes. The AWS Management Pack automatically checks and monitors the watcher node connectivity to AWS. When the watcher node is discovered, it shows up in this list. When the watcher node is ready, its state changes to Healthy.
Note
To establish connectivity with AWS, the AWS Management Pack requires that you deploy the AWS SDK for .NET, modules, and scripts to the watcher node. This can take about ten minutes. If the watcher node doesn't appear, or if you see the state as Not Monitored, verify your Internet connectivity and IAM permissions. For more information, see Troubleshooting the AWS Management Pack.



After the watcher node is discovered, dependent discoveries are triggered, and the AWS resources are added to the Monitoring workspace of the Operations console.


The discovery of AWS resources should finish within twenty minutes. This process can take more time, based on your Operations Manager environment, your AWS environment, the load on the management server, and the load on the watcher node. For more information, see Troubleshooting the AWS Management Pack.
