Create a custom Windows AMI
To create a Windows AMI, you launch an instance from an existing Windows AMI, customize the instance, and create a new AMI from the instance.
To create a custom Linux AMI, use the procedure for the type of volume for the instance. For more information, see Creating an Amazon EBS-Backed Linux AMI or Creating an Instance Store-Backed Linux AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
