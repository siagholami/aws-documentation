Step 3: Create an AWS Run As Account
You must set up credentials that grant AWS Management Pack access to your AWS resources.
To create an AWS Run As account


We recommend that you create an IAM user with the minimum access rights required (for example, the ReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy works in most cases). You'll need the access keys (access key ID and secret access key) for this user to complete this procedure. For more information, see Administering Access Keys for IAM Users in the IAM User Guide.


In the Operations console, on the Go menu, click Administration.


In the Administration workspace, expand the Run As Configuration node, and then select Accounts.


Right-click the Accounts pane, and then click Create Run As Account.


In the Create Run As Account Wizard, on the General Properties page, in the Run As account type list, select Basic Authentication.


Enter a display name (for example, "My IAM Account") and a description, and then click Next.



On the Credentials page, enter the access key ID in the Account name box and the secret access key in the Password box, and then click Next.



On the Distribution Security page, select More secure - I want to manually select the computers to which the credentials will be distributed, and then click Create.



Click Close.


In the list of accounts, select the account that you just created.


In the Actions pane, click Properties.


In the Properties dialog box, verify that the More Secure option is selected and that all management servers to be used to monitor your AWS resources are listed.
