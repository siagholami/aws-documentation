Create alarms that stop, terminate, reboot, or recover an instance
Using Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions, you can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your instances. You can use the stop or terminate actions to help you save money when you no longer need an instance to be running. You can use the reboot and recover actions to automatically reboot those instances or recover them onto new hardware if a system impairment occurs.
The AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents service-linked role enables AWS to perform alarm actions on your behalf. The first time you create an alarm in the AWS Management Console, the IAM CLI, or the IAM API, CloudWatch creates the service-linked role for you.
There are a number of scenarios in which you might want to automatically stop or terminate your instance. For example, you might have instances dedicated to batch payroll processing jobs or scientific computing tasks that run for a period of time and then complete their work. Rather than letting those instances sit idle (and accrue charges), you can stop or terminate them, which can help you to save money. The main difference between using the stop and the terminate alarm actions is that you can easily restart a stopped instance if you need to run it again later, and you can keep the same instance ID and root volume. However, you cannot restart a terminated instance. Instead, you must launch a new instance.
You can add the stop, terminate, reboot, or recover actions to any alarm that is set on an Amazon EC2 per-instance metric, including basic and detailed monitoring metrics provided by Amazon CloudWatch (in the AWS/EC2 namespace), as well as any custom metrics that include the InstanceId dimension, as long as its value refers to a valid running Amazon EC2 instance.
Console Support
You can create alarms using the Amazon EC2 console or the CloudWatch console. The procedures in this documentation use the Amazon EC2 console. For procedures that use the CloudWatch console, see Create Alarms That Stop, Terminate, Reboot, or Recover an Instance in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Permissions
If you are an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user, you must have the following permissions to create or modify an alarm:
 iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole, iam:GetPolicy, iam:GetPolicyVersion, and iam:GetRole – For all alarms with Amazon EC2 actions
 ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus and ec2:DescribeInstances – For all alarms on Amazon EC2 instance status metrics
 ec2:StopInstances – For alarms with stop actions
 ec2:TerminateInstances – For alarms with terminate actions
 No specific permissions are needed for alarms with recover actions.
If you have read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for Amazon EC2, you can still create an alarm but the stop or terminate actions won't be performed on the Amazon EC2 instance. However, if you are later granted permission to use the associated Amazon EC2 APIs, the alarm actions you created earlier are performed. For more information about IAM permissions, see Policies and Permissions in the IAM User Guide.

Adding stop actions to Amazon CloudWatch alarms
You can create an alarm that stops an Amazon EC2 instance when a certain threshold has been met. For example, you may run development or test instances and occasionally forget to shut them off. You can create an alarm that is triggered when the average CPU utilization percentage has been lower than 10 percent for 24 hours, signaling that it is idle and no longer in use. You can adjust the threshold, duration, and period to suit your needs, plus you can add an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification so that you receive an email when the alarm is triggered.
Instances that use an Amazon EBS volume as the root device can be stopped or terminated, whereas instances that use the instance store as the root device can only be terminated.
To create an alarm to stop an idle instance (Amazon EC2 console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances.


Select the instance. On the Monitoring tab, choose Create Alarm.


In the Create Alarm dialog box, do the following:


To receive an email when the alarm is triggered, for Send a notification to, choose an existing Amazon SNS topic, or choose create topic to create a new one.
To create a new topic, for Send a notification to, enter a name for the topic, and then for With these recipients, enter the email addresses of the recipients (separated by commas). After you create the alarm, you will receive a subscription confirmation email that you must accept before you can get notifications for this topic.


Choose Take the action, Stop this instance.


For Whenever, choose the statistic you want to use and then choose the metric. In this example, choose Average and CPU Utilization.


For Is, specify the metric threshold. In this example, enter 10 percent.


For For at least, specify the evaluation period for the alarm. In this example, enter 24 consecutive period(s) of 1 Hour.


To change the name of the alarm, for Name of alarm, enter a new name. Alarm names must contain only ASCII characters.
If you don't enter a name for the alarm, Amazon CloudWatch automatically creates one for you.
Note
You can adjust the alarm configuration based on your own requirements before creating the alarm, or you can edit them later. This includes the metric, threshold, duration, action, and notification settings. However, after you create an alarm, you cannot edit its name later.


Choose Create Alarm.


Adding terminate actions to Amazon CloudWatch alarms
You can create an alarm that terminates an EC2 instance automatically when a certain threshold has been met (as long as termination protection is not enabled for the instance). For example, you might want to terminate an instance when it has completed its work, and you don’t need the instance again. If you might want to use the instance later, you should stop the instance instead of terminating it. For information on enabling and disabling termination protection for an instance, see Enabling termination protection.
To create an alarm to terminate an idle instance (Amazon EC2 console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances.


Select the instance. On the Monitoring tab, choose Create Alarm.


In the Create Alarm dialog box, do the following:


To receive an email when the alarm is triggered, for Send a notification to, choose an existing Amazon SNS topic, or choose create topic to create a new one.
To create a new topic, for Send a notification to, enter a name for the topic, and then for With these recipients, enter the email addresses of the recipients (separated by commas). After you create the alarm, you will receive a subscription confirmation email that you must accept before you can get notifications for this topic.


Choose Take the action, Terminate this instance.


For Whenever, choose a statistic and then choose the metric. In this example, choose Average and CPU Utilization.


For Is, specify the metric threshold. In this example, enter 10 percent.


For For at least, specify the evaluation period for the alarm. In this example, enter 24 consecutive period(s) of 1 Hour.


To change the name of the alarm, for Name of alarm, enter a new name. Alarm names must contain only ASCII characters.
If you don't enter a name for the alarm, Amazon CloudWatch automatically creates one for you.
Note
You can adjust the alarm configuration based on your own requirements before creating the alarm, or you can edit them later. This includes the metric, threshold, duration, action, and notification settings. However, after you create an alarm, you cannot edit its name later.


Choose Create Alarm.


Adding reboot actions to Amazon CloudWatch alarms
You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors an Amazon EC2 instance and automatically reboots the instance. The reboot alarm action is recommended for Instance Health Check failures (as opposed to the recover alarm action, which is suited for System Health Check failures). An instance reboot is equivalent to an operating system reboot. In most cases, it takes only a few minutes to reboot your instance. When you reboot an instance, it remains on the same physical host, so your instance keeps its public DNS name, private IP address, and any data on its instance store volumes.
Rebooting an instance doesn't start a new instance billing hour, unlike stopping and restarting your instance. For more information, see Reboot Your Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Important
To avoid a race condition between the reboot and recover actions, avoid setting the same number of evaluation periods for a reboot alarm and a recover alarm. We recommend that you set reboot alarms to three evaluation periods of one minute each. For more information, see Evaluating an Alarm in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
To create an alarm to reboot an instance (Amazon EC2 console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances.


Select the instance. On the Monitoring tab, choose Create Alarm.


In the Create Alarm dialog box, do the following:


To receive an email when the alarm is triggered, for Send a notification to, choose an existing Amazon SNS topic, or choose create topic to create a new one.
To create a new topic, for Send a notification to, enter a name for the topic, and for With these recipients, enter the email addresses of the recipients (separated by commas). After you create the alarm, you will receive a subscription confirmation email that you must accept before you can get notifications for this topic.


Select Take the action, Reboot this instance.


For Whenever, choose Status Check Failed (Instance).


For For at least, specify the evaluation period for the alarm. In this example, enter 3 consecutive period(s) of 1 Minute.


To change the name of the alarm, for Name of alarm, enter a new name. Alarm names must contain only ASCII characters.
If you don't enter a name for the alarm, Amazon CloudWatch automatically creates one for you.


Choose Create Alarm.


Adding recover actions to Amazon CloudWatch alarms
You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors an Amazon EC2 instance. If the instance becomes impaired due to an underlying hardware failure or a problem that requires AWS involvement to repair, you can automatically recover the instance. Terminated instances cannot be recovered. A recovered instance is identical to the original instance, including the instance ID, private IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and all instance metadata.
CloudWatch prevents you from adding a recovery action to an alarm that is on an instance which does not support recovery actions.
When the StatusCheckFailed_System alarm is triggered, and the recover action is initiated, you are notified by the Amazon SNS topic that you chose when you created the alarm and associated the recover action. During instance recovery, the instance is migrated during an instance reboot, and any data that is in-memory is lost. When the process is complete, information is published to the SNS topic you've configured for the alarm. Anyone who is subscribed to this SNS topic receives an email notification that includes the status of the recovery attempt and any further instructions. You notice an instance reboot on the recovered instance.
The recover action can be used only with StatusCheckFailed_System, not with StatusCheckFailed_Instance.
The following problems can cause system status checks to fail:
 Loss of network connectivity
 Loss of system power
 Software issues on the physical host
 Hardware issues on the physical host that impact network reachability
The recover action is supported only on instances with the following characteristics:
 Use one of the following instance types: C3, C4, C5, C5a, C5n, M3, M4, M5, M5a, M5n, P3, R3, R4, R5, R5a, R5n, T2, T3, T3a, X1, or X1e
 Use default or dedicated instance tenancy
 Use EBS volumes only (do not configure instance store volumes). For more information, see 'Recover this instance' is disabled.
If your instance has a public IP address, it retains the public IP address after recovery.
Important
To avoid a race condition between the reboot and recover actions, avoid setting the same number of evaluation periods for a reboot alarm and a recover alarm. We recommend that you set recover alarms to two evaluation periods of one minute each. For more information, see Evaluating an Alarm in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
To create an alarm to recover an instance (Amazon EC2 console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances.


Select the instance. On the Monitoring tab, choose Create Alarm.


In the Create Alarm dialog box, do the following:

To create a new topic, for Send a notification to, enter a name for the topic, and for With these recipients, enter the email addresses of the recipients (separated by commas). After you create the alarm, you will receive a subscription confirmation email that you must accept before you can get email for this topic.
Note
Users must subscribe to the specified SNS topic to receive email notifications when the alarm is triggered.
The AWS account root user always receives email notifications when automatic instance recovery actions occur, even if an SNS topic is not specified.
The AWS account root user always receives email notifications when automatic instance recovery actions occur, even if it is not subscribed to the specified SNS topic.


Select Take the action, Recover this instance.


For Whenever, choose Status Check Failed (System).
