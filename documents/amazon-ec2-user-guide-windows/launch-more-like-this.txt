Launching an instance using parameters from an existing instance
The Amazon EC2 console provides a Launch More Like This wizard option that enables you to use a current instance as a base for launching other instances. This option automatically populates the Amazon EC2 launch wizard with certain configuration details from the selected instance. 
Note
The Launch More Like This wizard option does not clone your selected instance; it only replicates some configuration details. To create a copy of your instance, first create an AMI from it, then launch more instances from the AMI.
Alternatively, create a launch template to store the launch parameters for your instances.
The following configuration details are copied from the selected instance into the launch wizard:
 AMI ID
 Instance type
 Availability Zone, or the VPC and subnet in which the selected instance is located
 Public IPv4 address. If the selected instance currently has a public IPv4 address, the new instance receives a public IPv4 address - regardless of the selected instance's default public IPv4 address setting. For more information about public IPv4 addresses, see Public IPv4 addresses and external DNS hostnames.
 Placement group, if applicable
 IAM role associated with the instance, if applicable
 Shutdown behavior setting (stop or terminate)
 Termination protection setting (true or false)
 CloudWatch monitoring (enabled or disabled)
 Amazon EBS-optimization setting (true or false)
 Tenancy setting, if launching into a VPC (shared or dedicated)
 Kernel ID and RAM disk ID, if applicable
 User data, if specified
 Tags associated with the instance, if applicable 
 Security groups associated with the instance
 Association information. If the selected instance is associated with a configuration file, the same file is automatically associated with the new instance. If the configuration file includes a joined domain configuration, the new instance is joined to the same domain. For more information about joining a domain, see Launching an Instance (Simple AD and Microsoft AD).
The following configuration details are not copied from your selected instance; instead, the wizard applies their default settings or behavior:
 Number of network interfaces: The default is one network interface, which is the primary network interface (eth0).
 Storage: The default storage configuration is determined by the AMI and the instance type.
To use your current instance as a template


On the Instances page, select the instance you want to use.


Choose Actions, and then Launch More Like This.


The launch wizard opens on the Review Instance Launch page. You can check the details of your instance, and make any necessary changes by clicking the appropriate Edit link. 


When you are ready, choose Launch to select a key pair and launch your instance.

If the instance fails to launch or the state immediately goes to terminated instead of running, see Troubleshooting instance launch issues.
