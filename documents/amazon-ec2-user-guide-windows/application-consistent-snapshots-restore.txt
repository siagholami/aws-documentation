Restoring Volumes from VSS-Enabled EBS snapshots
You can use the RestoreVssSnapshotSampleScript.ps1 script to restore volumes on an instance from VSS-enabled EBS snapshots. This script performs the following tasks:
 Stops an instance
 Removes all existing drives from the instance (except the boot volume, if it was excluded)
 Creates new volumes from the snapshots
 Attaches the volumes to the instance by using the device ID tag on the snapshot
 Restarts the instance
Important
The following script detaches all volumes attached to an instance, and then creates new volumes from a snapshot. Make sure that you have properly backed-up the instance. The old volumes are not deleted. If you want, you can edit the script to delete the old volumes.
