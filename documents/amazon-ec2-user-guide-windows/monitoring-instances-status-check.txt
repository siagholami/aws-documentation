Monitoring the status of your instances
You can monitor the status of your instances by viewing status checks and scheduled events for your instances.
A status check gives you the information that results from automated checks performed by Amazon EC2. These automated checks detect whether specific issues are affecting your instances. The status check information, together with the data provided by Amazon CloudWatch, gives you detailed operational visibility into each of your instances. 
You can also see status of specific events that are scheduled for your instances. The status of events provides information about upcoming activities that are planned for your instances, such as rebooting or retirement. They also provide the scheduled start and end time of each event.
