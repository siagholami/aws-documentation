Deregistering your Windows AMI
You can deregister a Windows AMI when you have finished using it. After you deregister an AMI, you can't use it to launch new instances.
When you deregister an AMI, it doesn't affect any instances that you've already launched from the AMI or any snapshots created during the AMI creation process. You'll continue to incur usage costs for these instances and storage costs for the snapshot. Therefore, you should terminate any instances that you finished with and delete any snapshots that you are finished with.
The following diagram illustrates the process for cleaning up your Windows AMI.

To clean up your Windows AMI


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose AMIs. Select the AMI and take note of its ID â€” this can help you find the correct snapshot in the next step. Choose Actions, and then Deregister. When prompted for confirmation, choose Continue.
Note
It can take a few minutes before the console removes the AMI from the list. Choose Refresh to refresh the status.


In the navigation pane, choose Snapshots, and select the snapshot (look for the AMI ID in the Description column). Choose Actions, and then choose Delete Snapshot. When prompted for confirmation, choose Yes, Delete.


(Optional) If you are finished with an instance that you launched from the AMI, terminate it. In the navigation pane, choose Instances. Select the instance, choose Actions, then Instance State, and then Terminate. When prompted for confirmation, choose Yes, Terminate.
