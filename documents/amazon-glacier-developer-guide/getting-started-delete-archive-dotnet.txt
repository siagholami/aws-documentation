Delete an Archive from a Vault in Amazon S3 Glacier Using the AWS SDK for .NET
The following C# code example uses the high-level API of the AWS SDK for .NET to delete the archive you uploaded in the previous step. In the code example, note the following:
 The example creates an instance of the ArchiveTransferManager class for the specified Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) Region endpoint.
 The code example uses the US West (Oregon) Region (us-west-2) to match the location where you created the vault previously in Step 2: Create a Vault in Amazon S3 Glacier. 
 The example uses the Delete method of the ArchiveTransferManager class provided as part of the high-level API of the AWS SDK for .NET. 
For step-by-step instructions on how to run this example, see Running Code Examples. You need to update the code as shown with the archive ID of the file you uploaded in Step 3: Upload an Archive to a Vault in Amazon S3 Glacier.
