Get Vault Access Policy (GET access-policy)
Description
This operation retrieves the access-policy subresource set on the vaultâ€”for more information on setting this subresource, see Set Vault Access Policy (PUT access-policy). If there is no access policy set on the vault, the operation returns a 404 Not found error. For more information about vault access policies, see Amazon S3 Glacier Access Control with Vault Access Policies.
Requests
To return the current vault access policy, send an HTTP GET request to the URI of the vault's access-policy subresource.
Syntax

2. Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
3. Date: Date
4. Authorization: SignatureValue
5. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
Note
The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
