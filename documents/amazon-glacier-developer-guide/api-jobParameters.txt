jobParameters
Provides options for defining a job.
Contents
ArchiveId
The ID of the archive that you want. This field is required if the Type field is set to select or archive-retrieval. An error occurs if you specify this field for an inventory retrieval job request. 
Valid Values: Must be a valid archive ID that you obtained from a previous request to Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier).
Type: String
Required: Yes when Type is set to select or archive-retrieval.
Description
The optional description for the job. 
Valid Values: The description must be less than or equal to 1,024 bytes. The allowable characters are 7-bit ASCII without control codes—specifically, ASCII values 32–126 decimal or 0x20–0x7E hexadecimal.
Type: String
Required: no
Format
(Optional) The output format, when initiating a job to retrieve a vault inventory. If you are initiating an inventory job and don't specify a Format field, JSON is the default format.

Type: OutputLocation object
Required: Yes, for select jobs.
RetrievalByteRange
The byte range to retrieve for an archive-retrieval, in the form "StartByteValue-EndByteValue". If this field isn't specified, the whole archive is retrieved. If this field is specified, the byte range must be megabyte (1024*1024) aligned. Megabyte-aligned means that StartByteValue must be divisible by 1 MB, and EndByteValue plus 1 must be divisible by 1 MB or be the end of the archive specified as the archive byte size value minus 1. If RetrievalByteRange is not megabyte-aligned, this operation returns a 400 response. 
An error occurs if you specify this field for an inventory-retrieval or select job request.

SNSTopic

The SNS topic must exist. If it doesn't, S3 Glacier doesn't create it for you. Additionally, the SNS topic must have a policy that allows the account that created the job to publish messages to the topic. For information about SNS topic names, see CreateTopic in the Amazon Simple Notification Service API Reference.
