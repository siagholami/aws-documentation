Get Vault Notifications (GET notification-configuration)
Description
This operation retrieves the notification-configuration subresource set on the vault (see Set Vault Notification Configuration (PUT notification-configuration). If notification configuration for a vault is not set, the operation returns a 404 Not Found error. For more information about vault notifications, see Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon S3 Glacier. 
Requests
To retrieve the notification configuration information, send a GET request to the URI of a vault's notification-configuration subresource.
