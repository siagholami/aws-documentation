Abort Vault Lock (DELETE lock-policy)
Description
This operation stops the vault locking process if the vault lock is not in the Locked state. If the vault lock is in the Locked state when this operation is requested, the operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. Stopping the vault locking process removes the vault lock policy from the specified vault. 
A vault lock is put into the InProgress state by calling Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy). A vault lock is put into the Locked state by calling Complete Vault Lock (POST lockId). You can get the state of a vault lock by calling Get Vault Lock (GET lock-policy). For more information about the vault locking process, see Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock. For more information about vault lock policies, see Amazon S3 Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies.
This operation is idempotent. You can successfully invoke this operation multiple times, if the vault lock is in the InProgress state or if there is no policy associated with the vault.
Requests
To delete the vault lock policy, send an HTTP DELETE request to the URI of the vault's lock-policy subresource.

You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '-' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
