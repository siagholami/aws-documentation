Step 4: Download an Archive from a Vault in Amazon S3 Glacier
In this step, you'll download the sample archive you uploaded previously in Step 3: Upload an Archive to a Vault in Amazon S3 Glacier.
Important
Any archive operation, such as upload, download, or deletion, requires that you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or write code. There is no console support for archive operations. For example, to upload data, such as photos, videos, and other documents, you must either use the AWS CLI or write code to make requests, using either the REST API directly or the AWS SDKs. For more information about using Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) with the AWS CLI, see AWS CLI Reference for S3 Glacier. To install the AWS CLI, see AWS Command Line Interface.
In general, retrieving your data from S3 Glacier is a two-step process: 


Initiate a retrieval job.


After the job completes, download the bytes of data. 


To retrieve an archive from S3 Glacier, you first initiate a job. After the job completes, you download the data. For more information about archive retrievals, see Retrieving S3 Glacier Archives.
The access time of your request depends on the retrieval option you choose: Expedited, Standard, or Bulk retrievals. For all but the largest archives (250 MB), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Archives retrieved using Standard retrievals typically complete between 3–5 hours. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5–12 hours. For more information about the retrieval options, see the S3 Glacier FAQ. For information about data retrieval charges, see the S3 Glacier detail page.
The code examples shown in the following topics initiate the job, wait for it to complete, and then download the archive's data.
