Infrastructure Security in Amazon S3 Glacier
As a managed service, Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes whitepaper.
Access to S3 Glacier via the network is through AWS published APIs. Clients must support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2 or later. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes. Additionally, requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal, or you can use the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests.
VPC Endpoints
A virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Although S3 Glacier does not support VPC endpoints directly, you can take advantage of Amazon S3 VPC endpoints if you access S3 Glacier as a storage tier integrated with Amazon S3.
