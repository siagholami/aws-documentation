Step 2: Handle a chat contact
In Step 1, you used the Contact Control Panel (CCP) to manage a voice contact. In this step, you experience how to use the CCP to manage a chat contact. 


Choose the chat bubble to start a chat.



The Sample inbound flow automatically transfers to you a queue. However, you can type a message as the customer and the agent receives it. For example, I need help resetting my password.



In the CCP, accept the incoming chat. 



Use the CCP to send chat messages to the customer. 


When you're done chatting, choose End chat. Then in the CCP, choose Close contact.


Congratulations! You've experienced what it's like to chat using Amazon Connect.
