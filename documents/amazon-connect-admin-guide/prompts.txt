Create prompts
Prompts are audio files played in call flows. For example, hold music is a prompt. Amazon Connect comes with a set of prompts that you can add to your contact flows. Or, you can add your own recordings. 
You can upload a pre-recorded .wav file to use for your prompt, or record one in the web application.
We recommend using 8 KHz .wav files that are less than 50 MB and less than 5 minutes long. If you use higher rated audio libraries, such as 16 KHz or 16 bit files, Amazon Connect has to down sample them into 8 KHz samples due to PSTN limitations (here's a Wikipedia article that provides details: G.711). This may result in low quality audio.
We recommend that you align your prompts and routing policies with each other to ensure a smooth call flow for customers.
