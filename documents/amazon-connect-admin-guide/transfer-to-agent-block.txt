Contact block: Transfer to agent (beta)
Contact flow types
You can use this block in the following contact flow types:
 Transfer to Agent flow
 Transfer to Queue flow
Description

Ends the current contact flow and transfers the customer to an agent. If the agent is already with someone else, the contact is disconnected.
The Transfer to Agent block is a beta feature and works only for voice interactions.
We recommend using the Set working queue block for agent-to-agent transfers instead of using this block. The Set working queue block supports omnichannel transfers such as voice and chat. For instructions, see Set up agent-to-agent transfers.
