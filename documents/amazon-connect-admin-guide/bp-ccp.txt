Agent Workstation Requirements
Agent workstations in the contact center vary widely. While the Amazon Connect CCP is built to handle high levels of jitter and high latency environments, the architecture of the workstations that agents use, and the location and environment in which they take contacts, can impact the quality of experience.
Under-powered workstations can make it difficult for agents to access the tools and resources they need to service contacts. Also, keep in mind the resource requirements when scoping workstations to ensure that they can perform under load while appropriately multitasking for the use case. For the best agent and customer audio experience, a USB headset is recommended. Alternatively, you can redirect the contact to an external number, in E.164 format, using an agent's existing telephony.
The following values are the minimum system requirements for the workstations using the CCP only. Additional memory, bandwidth, and CPU should be scoped for the operating system and anything else running on the workstation to avoid resource contention.
 Browser—The latest three versions of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
 Network—100 Kbps bandwidth per connected workstation
 Memory—2 GB RAM
 Processor (CPU)—2 GHz
Monitoring Workstations
There are many factors that can affect CCP functionality at the workstation level. Access to various levels of logging information is essential in determining steps towards remediation. Adding additional logging and monitoring to workstations that are experiencing resource contention may further reduce available resources and invalidate test results. We recommended that your workstation meet the minimum requirements outlined in the Agent Workstation Requirements section of this guide, leaving additional resources available for logging, monitoring, malware scanning, operating system functions, and any other running processes.
Collect additional historical logging and data sources for correlation. If you see a correlation between the time of the event and the time the issue was reported, you may be able to determine the root cause with the following information:
 Round trip time (RTT) and packet loss to endpoints located within your Amazon Connect Region from your agent workstation, or an identical workstation on the same network segment. If no Region endpoints are available because of security policies, any public WAN endpoint suffices, for example, www.Amazon.com. Ideally, use your instance alias address (https://yourInstanceName.awsapps.com), and also your signaling address for endpoints.
 Regular monitoring of workstations that show processes running, and the current resource usage of each process.
 Workstation performance/utilization in these areas:
   Processor (CPU)
   Disk / drive
   RAM / memory
   Network throughput and performance
 Monitor all of the preceding for your VDI desktop environment, including RTT/packet monitoring between the agent workstation and the VDI environment.
Network Ports and Protocols
The CCP soft phone requires three connections to AWS resources. You must open the address and port to these resources with the appropriate protocol for the Region in which you created your Amazon Connect instance to allow bi-directional communication for full functionality of the CCP. The CCP needs access to the IP ranges for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) , Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon Connect, which are listed in the https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json file under Amazon EC2 (EC2), CloudFront (CLOUDFRONT), and Amazon Connect (AMAZON_CONNECT) respectively. The address ranges in the file are updated as new resources are added. This means that you need to monitor the included ranges and update your environment accordingly to ensure that agents can use the CCP successfully. 30 days after new IP ranges are added to this file, they start being used by Amazon Connect.

Alternatively, for Amazon EC2 endpoints, you can allow access for the following URL and port to allow all Amazon EC2 endpoints rather than all of the IP Address ranges listed in the AWS ipranges.json file:
rtc.connect-telecom.{region}.amazonaws.com:443
Replace {region} with the Region in which you created your Amazon Connect instance, such as us-east-1. In certain proxy applications, web socket handling may impact functionality when using this address. You should perform testing to validate before deploying to a production environment.
For CloudFront, you can use the following URL with port 443 to allow traffic for all CloudFront endpoints. Do this instead of including all ranges listed in the AWS ipranges.json file: https://myInstanceName.awsapps.com. Replace myInstanceName with the name of the instance for which to allow traffic. In certain proxy applications, web socket handling may impact functionality when using this address, so you should perform testing to validate before deploying to a production environment.
Port and Protocol Considerations
Consider the following when implementing your network configuration changes for Amazon Connect:
 You need to allow traffic for all addresses and ranges for the Region in which you created your Amazon Connect instance.
 If you are using a proxy or firewall between the CCP and Amazon Connect, increase the SSL certificate cache timeout to cover the duration of an entire shift for your agents, Do this to avoid connectivity issues with certificate renewals during their scheduled working time. For example, if your agents are scheduled to work 8 hour shifts that include breaks, increase the interval to 8 hours plus time for breaks and lunch.
 When opening ports, Amazon EC2 and Amazon Connect require only the ports for endpoints in the same Region as your instance. CloudFront, however, requires the endpoints in the Region closest to where your agents are located. If you have agents in multiple Regions, you need to allow traffic for the endpoints in each Region where agents are using the Amazon Connect CCP. For example, if your instance is US East, and you have an agent physically located in another country, you would need to open the ports for CloudFront using the IP address ranges for the Region where the agent is located.
 Update the ranges for which traffic is allowed within the 30 days after the ranges are updated in the AWS ipranges.json file. If you don't, you may experience intermittent connectivity issues when using the CCP with a softphone when traffic is routed to the new ranges, but not allowed to connect to your agents using the CCP.
 If you are using a custom CCP with the Amazon Connect Streams API, you can create a media-less CCP that does not require opening ports for communication with Amazon Connect, but still requires ports opened for communication with Amazon EC2 and CloudFront.
Region Selection Considerations
Amazon Connect Region selection is contingent upon data governance requirements, use case, services available in each Region, and latency in relation to your agents, contacts, and external transfer endpoint geography.
 Agent location/network—CCP connectivity traverses the public WAN, so it is important that the workstation has the lowest latency and fewest hops possible, specifically to the AWS Region where your resources and Amazon Connect instance are hosted. For example, hub and spoke networks that need to make several hops to reach an edge router can add latency and reduce the quality of experience.
When you set up your instance and agents, make sure to create your instance in the Region that is geographically closest to the Region where you create your instance. If you need to set up an instance in a specific Region to comply with company policies or other regulations, choose the configuration that results in the fewest network hops between your agent computers and your Amazon Connect instance.
 Location of your callers—Because calls are anchored to your Amazon Connect Region endpoint, they are subject to PSTN latency. Ideally your callers and transfer endpoints are geographically located as closely as possible to the AWS Region where your Amazon Connect instance is hosted for lowest latency.
For optimal performance, and to limit the latency for your customers when they call in to your contact center, create your Amazon Connect instance in the Region that is geographically closest to where your customers call from. You might consider creating multiple Amazon Connect instances, and providing contact information to customers for the number that is closest to where they call from.
 External transfers—from Amazon Connect remain anchored to your Amazon Connect Region endpoint for the duration of the call. Per-minute usage continues to accrue until the call is disconnected by the recipient of the transferred call. The call is not recorded after the agent drops or the transfer completes. The CTR data and associated call recording of a transferred call are generated after the call is terminated. Whenever possible, don't transfer calls that could be transferred back into Amazon Connect, known as circular transfers, to avoid compounding PSTN latency.
Agents Using Amazon Connect Remotely
Remote agents, those that use Amazon Connect from a location other than those connected to your organization's main network, may experience issues relating to their local network if they have an unstable connection, packet loss, or high latency. This is compounded if a VPN is required to access resources. Ideally, the agents are located close to the AWS Region where your AWS resources and Amazon Connect instance are hosted, and have a stable connection to the public WAN.
Rerouting Audio
When rerouting audio to an existing device, consider the location of the device in relation to your Amazon Connect Region. This is so you can account for potential additional latency. If you reroute your audio, whenever there is a call intended for the agent, an outbound call is placed to the configured device. When the agent answers the device, that agent is connected with the caller. If the agent does not answer their device, they are moved into a missed contact state until they or a supervisor changes their state back to available.
Using AWS Direct Connect
AWS Direct Connect can help solve for latency and poor call quality between your edge router and AWS resources. It also allows you to configure your edge router to redirect AWS traffic across dedicated fiber rather than traversing the public WAN. This allows for a durable, consistent connection rather than relying on your ISP to dynamically route requests to AWS resources. Keep in mind that this does not solve issues with the private LAN/WAN traversal to your edge router.
Using Amazon Connect in a VDI Environment
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments add another layer of complexity to your solution that warrants separate POC efforts and performance testing to optimize. The Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel (CCP) can operate in thick, thin, and zero client VDI environments as any other WebRTC based browser application does, and the configuration/support/optimization is best handled by your VDI support team. That being said, the following is a collection of considerations and best practices that have been helpful for our VDI-based customers.
 Location of your agents—Ideally, there are as few hops as possible with the lowest round trip time between the location from which your agents use the CCP and the VDI host location.
 Host location of your VDI solution—Ideally, your VDI host location is on the same network segment as your agents, with as few hops as possible from both internal resources as well as an edge router. You also want the lowest round-trip time possible to both WebRTC and Amazon EC2 range endpoints.
 Network—Each hop that traffic goes through between endpoints increases the possibility of failure and adds opportunity to introduce latency. VDI environments are particularly susceptible to call quality issues if the underlying route is not optimized or the pipe isn't either fast or wide enough. While AWS Direct Connect can improve call quality from the edge router to AWS, it will not address internal routing issues. You may need to upgrade or optimize your private LAN/WAN, or redirect to an external device to circumvent call audio issues. In most scenarios, if this is required, the CCP is not the only application that is having issues.
 Dedicated resources—at the Network and desktop level are recommended to prevent an impact to available agent resources from activities, such as backups and large file transfers. One way to prevent resource contention is by restricting the desktop access to Amazon Connect users who will be using their environment similarly, instead of sharing resources with other business units who may use those resources differently.
 Using a soft phone with remote connections—in VDI environments can cause impact to audio quality. If your agents connect to a remote endpoint and operates in that environment, we recommend either rerouting audio to an external E.164 endpoint or connecting the media through the local device and then signaling through the remote connection. You can build a custom CCP with the Amazon Connect Streams API by creating a CCP with no media for call signaling. This way, the media is handled on the local desktop using standard CCP, and the signaling and call controls are handled on the remote connection with the CCP with no media. For more information about the streams API, see the GitHub repository at https://github.com/aws/amazon-connect-streams.
CCP Connectivity
When an agent logs in, the CCP attempts to connect to the Amazon EC2 signaling endpoints listed in the AWS ipranges.json file, Amazon Connect for media, and CloudFront for web artifacts such as images. When the agent logs out or the browser is closed, endpoints are reselected when the agent next logs in. If a connection to Amazon EC2 or Amazon Connect fails, errors display on the CCP. If a connection to CloudFront fails, web elements such as buttons and icons, or even the page itself fails to load correctly.
Outbound calls
 When an outbound call is placed, the event signal is sent to the Amazon EC2 endpoint, which then communicates with Amazon Connect to place the call. Upon a successful dial attempt, the agent is bridged in, which anchors the call to the agent's Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also uses the anchor until the call is disconnected. Anchoring can help reduce PSTN latency.
Inbound calls
 When an inbound call is received, the call is anchored to an Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also use this anchor until the call is disconnected.
 When an agent is available, the call is pushed through via a new Amazon EC2 connection to their browser and offered to the agent.
 When the agent accepts the call and either the external device has been answered or the CCP determines it can receive a call, a connection to Amazon Connect is established for call media to the agent.
Transferred calls
 When a call is transferred, the transfer event that signals to place an outbound call to the specified transfer destination is sent to Amazon EC2, which then communicates with Amazon Connect to place the call.
 When the call is connected, the agent is bridged in, anchoring the call to the agent's existing Amazon Connect endpoint. Any external transfers or conferences also use this anchor until the call is disconnected.
 If the agent hangs up after the call is bridged, the agent's connection to the call is terminated, but Amazon Connect hangs on to the call at the Amazon Connect anchor point until there is a far side disconnect. When the call is disconnected, CTRs and associated recordings are generated and made available for the call.
Missed calls
 If the call is waiting on an agent, customer queue flow logic is used until an agent is available and the call has been successfully routed to that agent.
 If the agent does not accept the call, the agent moves into a Missed Call state and is unable to take calls until the agent, or a call center manager, changes their status to Available again. The caller does not hear ringing while the call is waiting for the agent, and continues to hold until connected with an agent as defined in the customer queue flow logic. 
Panic logout
 If the browser window where the CCP is running is closed, the call remains connected, but opening the browser and logging back in will not allow you to re-establish the media connection. You are still able to transfer or end the call, but no audio path is established between the agent and caller.
