What's new in metrics
Thanks to your feedback, we've made changes to Amazon Connect metrics. This topic gives you a overview of the improvements. 
Upcoming changes: Quick filters for drilling into Routing profiles and Queues tables
In real-time metrics reports, for Routing profiles and Queues tables, you can open pre-filtered tables that display the associated queues, routing profiles, or agents. These quick filters provide a way for you to drill into the performance data.
Example 1: Queues table -> Routing profiles table -> Agents table
For example, at a Queues table, choose the dropdown and then choose View routing profiles.

Below the Queues table, a Routing profiles table appears. It is filtered to display only the routing profiles associated with the queue. On the Routing profiles table, you can choose quick filters to display queues or agents only associated with that routing profile.

Example 2: Queues table -> Agents table
At the Queues table, choose View agents. Below the Queues table, an Agents table appears. It is filtered to display all the agents working that queue. The agents may be associated with different routing profiles. 

Upcoming changes: New real-time metrics for inbound and outbound contact time
The following new real-time metrics are upcoming in a future release. 
Avg incoming connecting time
The average time between when contacts are initiated Amazon Connect reserving the agent for the contact, and the agent is connected. 
In the agent event stream, this time is calculated by averaging the duration between the contact state of STATE_CHANGE event changes from CONNECTING to CONNECTED/MISSED/ERROR. 
The following image shows the three parts that go into calculating Avg incoming connecting time. It also shows what is in the agent event stream.

Avg outbound connecting time
The average time between when outbound contacts are initiated by Amazon Connect reserving the agent for the contact, and the agent is connected. 
The following image shows the four parts that go into calculating Avg outbound connecting time. It also shows what is in the agent event stream.

Avg callback connecting time
Then average time between when callback contacts are initiated by Amazon Connect reserving the agent for the contact, and the agent is connected. 
The following image shows the five parts that go into calculating Avg callback connecting time. It also shows what is in the agent event stream.

Upcoming changes: New historical metrics for inbound and outbound contact time
The following new historical metrics are upcoming in a future release. 
Agent incoming connecting time
The total time between when a contact is initiated by Amazon Connect reserving the agent for the contact, and the agent is connected.
In the agent event stream, this is the duration between the contact state of STATE_CHANGE event changes from CONNECTING to CONNECTED/MISSED/ERROR.

June 2020: Changes for omnichannel spport
Group by channel
To group queues or routing profiles by channel on real-time metrics reports


On the navigation menu, choose Metrics and quality, Real-time metrics, and then select either Queues or Routing profiles. 



Choose Settings. 



On the Table Settings page, choose the Groupings tab and then select Queues grouped by channels. Or, if you're setting up a Routing profiles report, choose Routing profiles grouped by channels.



Choose Apply.


The table shows a column for Channel.


To group by channel on historical metrics reports


On the navigation menu, choose Metrics and quality, Historical metrics, and then choose a report. 


Choose Settings. 


On the Table Settings page, choose the Groupings tab. Add Channel, and choose Apply.



The table shows a column for Channel, as shown in the following image.



Group by queue in historical metrics reports
In the historical metrics report, when you group or filter metrics by Queue, the results for the following metrics aren't accurate: 
 Agent idle time (not supported in queue grouping as of June, 2020)
 Agent on contact time (not supported in queue grouping as of June, 2020)
 Occupancy (not supported in queue grouping as of June, 2020)
Because of this, on the Table Settings page, Metrics tab, these metrics are inactive, as shown in the following image:

In addition, in the historical metrics report, Amazon Connect displays a hyphen (-) in place of results for these metrics, and the cells are inactive (gray).

Effect of queue grouping on saved and scheduled reports
If the Queue grouping or filter is used on the following reports, note these effects: 
 Saved reports. The columns for these metrics don't appear in the saved reports when grouped by Queue. When the saved report is filtered by Queue, however, it shows "-".
 Scheduled reports. These reports continue to run successfully, but no results are returned for these metrics. 
Agent on contact time (not supported in queue grouping as of June, 2020)
On historical metrics reports when an agent handles multiple chats concurrently, Agent on contact time shows wall clock time: the amount of time spent chatting. However, there isn't a metric that shows the time an agent spends chatting with each contact.
In addition, no results are returned when you use the Queue grouping or filter with Agent on contact time.
Agent idle time (not supported in queue grouping as of June, 2020
The Agent idle time metric divides the idle time into each queue associated with the agent. When contacts are grouped or filtered by Queue, however, Amazon Connect doesn't provide an accurate view into the how the agent is working. Because of this, Amazon Connect doesn't show Agent idle time when you apply the Queue grouping or filter to your report. 
Occupancy (not supported in queue grouping as of June, 2020)
With the addition of chat, the Occupancy metric is now defined as the percentage of time that an agent was active on contacts. This percentage is calculated as follows:
 (Agent on contact (wall clock time) / (Agent on contact (wall clock time)  Agent idle time)) 
Because Agent idle time is now inaccurate when contacts are grouped or filtered by Queues, the Occupancy metric is also inaccurate. As a result, when contacts are grouped or filtered by Queues, Occupancy doesn't appear on the report.
Occupancy no longer appears on the Dashboard page.
November 2019
Name changes for "Missed" and "Agent status" and "On call"
The following real-time metrics were renamed:



Old name
New name




Missed
Agent non-response


Agent status
Agent activity


On call
On contact



For each metric, existing saved reports automatically start displaying the new name; you don't need to do anything for the new name to appear in your reports. 
The column order for a saved report containing one of these metrics stays the same. For example, if you previously saved a report where Agent status was the third metric, now when you open that saved report, Agent activity is the name for the third metric.
For Missed, only the name of the metric changed; the underlying calculation stayed the same. We've changing the name of this metric to Agent non-response so it better reflects its definition: 
 Agent non-response increments whenever a contact is offered to an agent, and the agent doesn't respond to the contact for whatever reason. 
For example, the agent could have intentionally let the timer run out, or the agent could have forgotten to grant microphone access in the Contact Control Panel and never heard the ring. In these situations, Amazon Connect doesn't drop the contact. Instead, the routing engine will offer it to another available agent, while the customer continues to wait in queue. This means a single contact could result in multiple Agent non-responses before an agent responds and handles the contact.
For On call, the name change to On Contact applies to the Real-time metrics UI only. You can continue using AGENTS_ON_CALL with the GetCurrentMetricData API to retrieve data for this metric.
Label updates for "Agent activity" and "Contact state"
Labels are the values returned in a report. For example, in the following image Available and Basic Routing Profile are labels. 

For Agent Activity and Contact State, we renamed some of the labels that describe what the agent's current activity is and what's happening with the contact they are currently working on. This way, the labels in the Real-Time Metrics report are more consistent with the labels the agent sees in the Contact Control Panel. They also align with the data returned about these different states in other parts of Amazon Connect.
When the name of Agent Status changed to Agent Activity, the following labels changed, too:

Before: Agent Status Labels
After: Agent Activity Labels
