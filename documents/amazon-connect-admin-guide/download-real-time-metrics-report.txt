To download a real-time metrics report as a CSV file


Create the report.


Choose the down arrow next to Save in the top-right corner of the page and choose Download CSV.


When prompted, confirm whether to open or save the file.



You can convert the seconds to minutes using an Excel formula. Alternatively, if you have a short report, you can copy and paste the data from Amazon Connect to Excel and it will preserve the format.
