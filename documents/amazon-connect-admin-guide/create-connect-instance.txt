Create a dev (Sandbox) or test (QA) instance
You might want to create multiple contact center instances, for example, one as a Sandbox for development, another for QA, and a third for Production. 
Each instance functions only within the AWS Region in which you create it.
Important
There's no way to migrate all resources between virtual contact center instances. You can migrate some instance resources manually or with the assistance of AWS Support. Other resources must be recreated.
For more information, see Can I migrate my Amazon Connect instance from a test environment to a production environment?
To create another instance


In the AWS Management Console, choose Amazon Connect.


Choose Add an instance.


Complete the steps on the Amazon Connect resource configuration page. For instructions see Create an Amazon Connect instance.
