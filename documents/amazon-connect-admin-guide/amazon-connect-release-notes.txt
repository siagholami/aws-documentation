Upcoming changes
We continuously make improvements to Amazon Connect based on your feedback, and also as we find ways to improve your experience. Take a look at this section to learn about planned changes to help improve how your agents work. 
New "Next status" for agents








This feature is available only to customers who are using the latest Contact Control Panel (CCP). The URL for the latest CCP looks like this: https://name of your instance.awsapps.com/connect/ccp-v2/



In busy contact centers, it can be difficult for agents to take a break or go offline when contacts are being quickly routed to them. To help agents manage their time, we will release a feature that lets agents pause new contacts being routed to them while they finish their current contacts. When all their slots are cleared, Amazon Connect automatically sets agents to the next status, such as Lunch.
The following images of the Contact Control Panel (CCP) show how agents use this feature.



The agent is on a contact.


The agent chooses their next status, such as Lunch. They can choose only a custom (NPT) status, or Offline. 


The agent is in Next status: Lunch. They are still on contact. No new contacts can be routed to them. 


The contact ends. The agent finishes ACW, and chooses Clear contact. Instead of going back to Available, their CCP is automatically set to Lunch. 


How to cancel "Next status"
Agents can easily switch from Next status back to Available. The ability to switch their status is useful, for example, if they accidentally choose Next status: Lunch, or if they decide not to go to Lunch before Amazon Connect automatically sets to that status. 
The following images show this workflow.



While working on the same contact, the agent cancels Next status: Lunch and goes back to Available.


The contact ends and the agent is still Available for new contacts to be routed to them. 


Example 1: Set "Next status" while handling only ACW contacts
Let's say an agent is finishing after contact work (ACW) for one or more contacts, such as a voice contact or multiple chats. They are not on contact with anyone.
Instead of choosing Clear contact when the agent finishes ACW, they choose Lunch. This puts them in Next status: Lunch only briefly. 
Here's what happens in this scenario:


Agent finishes ACW and chooses Lunch instead of Clear contact.


Amazon Connect stops routing new contacts to them.


All their slots are cleared. This is so the agent doesn't have to choose Clear contact to end the ACW. 


Because all the ACWs have been cleared, Amazon Connect immediately starts the automatic transition that sets the agent's status to Lunch.


Agents were put into Next status - Lunch only briefly (milliseconds!). They might even see it in the CCP if they look fast enough. 
This order of events mirrors how the CCP currently works when agents change their status while working on ACW. For example, an agent is finishing ACW and they set their status to Lunch. Here's what happens next:


Amazon Connect stops routing new contacts to them.


The ACW slot is cleared for the agent so they don't have to choose Clear contact. 


The agent is set to Lunch.


Example 2: Set "Next status" while managing some chats on contact and other chats in ACW
Let's say an agent is managing two chats: 
 Customer 1 is in ACW.
 Customer 2 is on contact.
While still on a contact, the agent sets their status to Offline. This puts them in the Next status: Offline state. 
Here's what happens in this scenario:


The agent sets their status to Offline.


Amazon Connect stops routing new contacts to them.


The contact that is in ACW is cleared so the agent doesn't have to choose Clear contact. Only the connected chat remains.


The agent's status is Next status: Offline, and they continue working on their connected chat.


After they finish work on that contact, the agent chooses Clear contact to end the ACW. 


Amazon Connect automatically sets the agents status to Offline.


Metrics: No changes due to "Next status"
When an agent is in Next status, their metrics are the same as when their status is Available.
For example, an agent is handling one contact and chooses Next status. Here's what you'll see in the real-time metrics report:
 Agent Activity state = On Contact
 Agent - Staffed = 1
Non-productive time (NPT) is not incremented when an agent is in Next status because the agent is still Available. NPT increments only when the agent actually enters the non-productive status, such as Lunch.
Agent event stream has new NextAgentStatus field
When an agent sets their status to Next status, Amazon Connect populates a new NextAgentStatus field with the next status selected by the agent. 
At the same time, the AgentStatus field continues to display Available. 
The following code snippet shows what the agent event stream looks like when an agent has set their CCP to Next status: Lunch. 
```
"CurrentAgentSnapshot": 
{
    "AgentStatus": {
            "ARN": "example-ARN",
            "Name": "Available",
            "StartTimestamp": "2019-08-13T20:52:30.704Z"
        },
     "NextAgentStatus": {
            "Name": "Lunch",
            "ARN": "example-ARN2",
            "EnqueueTimestamp": "2019-08-13T20:58:00.004Z",
        }
}
```
When an agent has not selected a Next status, the field is null, as shown in the following snippet:
```
"CurrentAgentSnapshot": {
    "AgentStatus": {
            "ARN": "example-ARN",
            "Name": "Available",
            "StartTimestamp": "2019-08-13T20:52:30.704Z"
        },
     "NextAgentStatus": null
}
```
Amazon Connect Streams API and "Next status"
When we release this feature, it will have the following effect:
 If you integrate with Amazon Connect Streams API and your agents interact directly with the native CCP user interface, then at release your agents will start using this new feature immediately.
 If you integrate with Amazon Connect Streams API but your agents don't interact directly with the native CCP user interface, then at release your contact center will continue to have the previous behavior when agent.setState() is called: an agent will not be able to select an NPT or Offline status while connected to at least one contact. 
To use Next status with a custom CCP integration that does not directly embed the CCP, you will need to make additional changes that will be detailed further in the Amazon Connect Streams README.

Metrics

The real time metric On call is now incremented whenever an agent is handling a contact who is connected, on hold, in After Contact Work, or the agent is dialog out to a customer. 

This metric is available in the Queues tables and Routing Profile tables on the Real time metrics page. It's also returned by the GetCurrentMetricData API as AGENTS_ON_CALL. 
June 2019 Update
The following update was released in June 2019:
Contact Flows

Added contact flow versioning so you can choose between a saved or published version when you roll back.

May 2019 Updates
The following updates were released in May 2019:
Metrics and Reporting

Improved the error messages you might encounter when creating, editing, or deleting a scheduled report. 
In the Historical metrics report UI, changed Contacts missed to Agent non-response. This metric appears as Contacts missed in scheduled reports and exported CSV files.
In the agent event stream, fixed the formatting of the timestamp millisecond so you can better order and analyze the data. To learn more, see Amazon Connect agent event streams. 

Contact Control Panel

Resolved an issue where calling a destroy action (such as connection.destroy) using the Amazon Connect Streams API resulted in different behavior depending on which leg of the conversation it was called from: the agent or the customer. Now calling a destroy action results in the same behavior for both: a busy conversation is moved to After Call Work (ACW) and a conversation in any other state is cleared. If you used the native Contact Control Panel instead of the Amazon Connect Streams API, you weren't impacted by this issue.

April 2019 Updates
The following updates were released in April 2019:
Contact Control Panel

Resolved an issue where the hold flow didn't run in this case: 
The agent missed a call and then set themselves back to Available.
Then they were re-routed the same call.
The agent put that customer on hold while handling the call.

However, taking the customer off hold worked as expected and no other impact occurred.
 Resolved an issue where the Amazon Connect Streams API returned softphoneAutoAccept = FALSE even though Auto-Accept Call was enabled for the agent. 
March 2019 Update
The following updates were released in March 2019:
Metrics and Reporting

Improved the error messages you might encounter when running real-time metrics reports. For example, if you manually configure a real-time metrics report to contain more than 100 queues, we'll display this message: "You've hit the maximum limit of 100 queues. Please reconfigure your report to contain no more than 100 queues." To learn more, see No metrics or too few rows in a queues report?

Contact Control Panel

Resolved an issue where, in rare cases, an agent already handling an outbound call could have been incorrectly presented with an additional queued callback, even though they are only allowed to handle one contact at a time. Since that agent would have been on contact and not idle, the agent wouldn't have been able to accept the queued callback.

In these cases, the outbound call was not impacted; the agent wouldn't have noticed any differences in the CCP. The callback was presented to another agent instead of being dropped.
