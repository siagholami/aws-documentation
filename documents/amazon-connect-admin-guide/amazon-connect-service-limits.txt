You can calculate your configured quota using CloudWatch metrics. For instructions, see Use CloudWatch metrics to calculate concurrent call quota.  Or, edit a queue and enter an exceptionally large number for the contact limit. The resulting error message will display your quota. For example, in the following image, it shows the quota for that instance is 99.

50 This quota refers to number of queue/channel combinations per routing profile. For example, in the following image there are two queues, but there are three queue-channel combinations: BasicQueue-Voice, BasicQueue-Chat, and Queue10-Voice. This counts three towards the service limit of 50.

Reports per instance
500 Personal saved reports count towards the reports per instance. For example, if one of your supervisors saves a report every day, it will count towards your overall number of saved reports per instance. As a best practice, we recommend you implement policies so reports don't pile up.

Amazon Connect API throttling quotas
Amazon Connect throttling quotas are by account, not by user and not by instance. For example: 
 If different IAM users from the same account make requests, they are sharing a throttle bucket. 
 If multiple requests are sent from different instances from the same account, they are also sharing a throttle bucket. 
When you use the Amazon Connect Service API , the number of requests per second is limited to the following:
 For the GetMetricData  and GetCurrentMetricData  operations, a RateLimit of 5 requests per second, and a BurstLimit of 8 requests per second.
 For all other operations, a RateLimit of 2 requests per second, and a BurstLimit of 5 requests per second.
Amazon Connect Participant Service API throttling quotas
For the Amazon Connect Participant Service, the quotas are by instance.
When you use the Amazon Connect Participant Service API, the number of requests per second is limited to the following:
  CreateParticipantConnection, DisconnectParticipant, and GetTranscript: a RateLimit of 2 requests per second, and a BurstLimit of 5 requests per second.
  SendEvent and SendMessage: a RateLimit of 10 requests per second, and a BurstLimit of 15 requests per second.
