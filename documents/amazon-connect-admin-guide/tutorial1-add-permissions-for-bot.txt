Step 2: Add permissions to Amazon Lex bot
To use a bot in your contact flow, add it to your Amazon Connect instance. 


Open the Amazon Connect console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/).


Choose the name of the instance that you created.



Do not log in on the name page (this method of logging in is for emergency access only). Rather, choose Contact flows.



Under Amazon Lex, use the drop-down arrow to choose HelpDesk, and then choose  Add Lex Bot.

Tip
Only published Amazon Lex bots appear in the drop-down list.


When you're done, choose Amazon Connect to navigate back to instances page.



Choose the access URL of your instance.



This takes you back to the Amazon Connect dashboard.
