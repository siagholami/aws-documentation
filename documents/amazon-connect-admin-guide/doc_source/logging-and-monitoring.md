# Logging and monitoring Amazon Connect<a name="logging-and-monitoring"></a>

Monitoring is important for maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of your contact center\. 

You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multipoint failure if one occurs\. But before you start monitoring Amazon Connect, you should create a monitoring plan that includes answers to the following questions:
+ What are your monitoring goals?
+ What data about your Amazon Connect instance will you monitor?
+ How often will you monitor your instance?
+ What monitoring tools will you use?
+ Who will perform the monitoring tasks?
+ Who should be notified when something goes wrong?

See the following topics to learn how to use Amazon CloudWatch Logs and AWS CloudTrail to monitor Amazon Connect and describes the Amazon Connect metrics sent to CloudWatch:
