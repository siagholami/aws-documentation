# Enable Contact Lens for Amazon Connect<a name="enable-analytics"></a>

To enable Contact Lens in a contact flow, add a [Set recording and analytics behavior ](set-recording-behavior.md) block for the flow, and configure it for Contact Lens\.

**Tip**  
If you want to continue using Contact Lens to collect data after transferring a contact to another agent or queue, you need to add another [Set recording and analytics behavior ](set-recording-behavior.md) block with **Enable analytics** enabled for the flow\. This is because a transfer generates a second contact ID and CTR\. Contact Lens needs to run on that CTR as well\.

**To enable Contact Lens in a contact flow**

1. Add the [Set recording and analytics behavior ](set-recording-behavior.md) block to a contact flow\.

1. In the contact block, under **Call recording**, choose **On**, **Agent and Customer**\.

   You need both agent and customer call recordings to use Content Lens\.

## How to enable redaction of sensitive data<a name="enable-redaction"></a>

To enable redaction of sensitive data in a contact flow, choose **Redact sensitive data**\.

## Review sensitive data redaction for accuracy<a name="review-sensitive-data-redaction"></a>

The redaction feature is designed to identify and remove sensitive data\. However, due to the predictive nature of machine learning, it may not identify and remove all instances of sensitive data in a transcript generated by Contact Lens\. We recommend you review any redacted output to ensure it meets your needs\.

**Important**  
The redaction feature does not meet the requirements for de\-identification under medical privacy laws like the U\.S\. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \(HIPAA\), so we recommend you continue to treat it as protected health information after redaction\.

For the location of redacted files and examples, see [Example Contact Lens output files](contact-lens-example-output-files.md)\.

## Dynamically enable Contact Lens using contact attributes<a name="dynamically-enable-analytics-contact-flow"></a>

You can dynamically enable Contact Lens and the redaction of the output files based on the language of the customer\. For example, for customers using en\-US, you may want only a redacted file whereas for those using en\-GB, you may want both the original and redacted output files\.
+ Redaction: choose one of the following \(case sensitive\)
  + None
  + RedactedOnly
  + RedactedandOriginal
+ Language: choose one of the following \(case sensitive\)
  + en\-US
  + en\-GB
  + en\-IN
  + en\-AU
  + es\-US: Redaction is not supported for this language

You can set these attributes in the following ways:
+ User defined: use a **Set contact attributes** block\. For general instructions about using this block, see [Using a Set contact attributes block](use-attributes-cust-exp.md#use-set-contact-attrib-block)\. Define the **Destination key** and **Value** for redaction and language as needed\.

+ [Use a Lambda function](use-attributes-cust-exp.md#attribs-with-lambda)\. This is similar to how you set up user\-defined contact attributes\. A Lambda function can return the result as a key\-value pair, depending on the language of the Lambda response\. The following example shows a Lambda response in JSON: 

  ```
  {
     'redaction_option': 'RedactedOnly',
     'language': 'en-US'
  }
  ```
