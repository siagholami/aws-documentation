**Important**  
Closing the CCP window doesn't automatically sign out an agent\. Amazon Connect still tries to route contacts to them\. To change this behavior, a developer can customize CCP for your contact center\. For instructions, see [Log out agents automatically when they close their CCP](automatic-logout.md)\. 

1. At the top of the CCP, select the **Change Status** dropdown menu\. 

1. Choose **Log out**\.
