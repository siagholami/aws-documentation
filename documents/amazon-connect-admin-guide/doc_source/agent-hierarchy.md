# Set up agent hierarchies<a name="agent-hierarchy"></a>

 Agent hierarchies are a way for you to organize agents into teams and groups for reporting purposes\. It's useful to organize them based on their location and their skill sets\. For example, you might want to create large groups, such as all agents who work on a specific continent, or smaller groups such as all agents working in a specific department\. 

You can also configure hierarchies with up to five levels, and segment agents or teams\. Here are a couple of things to note about using hierarchies:
+ Removing agents from a level affects historical reporting\.
+ Hierarchies do not determine agent permissions or security settings\. They define the organizational structure of agent groups for effective reporting\.

## Required permissions<a name="permissions-agent-hierarchy"></a>

To create agent hierarchies, you need the **View \- Agent hierarchy** permission in your security profile\. 

**Note**  
Since agent hierarchies may include location and skill set data, you also need this permission to view the agent hierarchy information in a real\-time metrics report\.
