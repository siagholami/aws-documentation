# View how many contacts are waiting for a callback<a name="view-contacts-in-callback-queue"></a>

To see only the number of customers who are waiting for a call back, you need to create a queue that only takes callback contacts\. To learn how to do this, see [Set up routing](connect-queues.md)\.

Currently there isn't a way to see the phone numbers of the contacts waiting for callbacks\.
