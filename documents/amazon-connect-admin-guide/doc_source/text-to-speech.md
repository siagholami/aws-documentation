## Amazon Polly converts text\-to\-speech<a name="amazon-polly-default-voice-free"></a>

To convert text\-to\-speech, Amazon Connect uses Amazon Polly, a service that converts text into lifelike speech using SSML\. 

Amazon Polly default voices are **free**\. You are charged only for using custom voices that are associated with your account\.

## Amazon Polly best sounding voice<a name="amazon-polly-best-sounding-voice"></a>

Amazon Polly periodically releases improved voices and speaking styles\. You can choose to automatically resolve your text\-to\-speech to the most lifelike and natural sounding variant of a voice\. For example, if your contact flows use Joanna, Amazon Connect automatically resolves to Joannaâ€™s Conversational speaking style\. 

**Note**  
If no Neural version is available, Amazon Connect defaults to the standard voice\. 

**To automatically use the best sounding voice**

1. Open the Amazon Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/connect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)\.

1. If prompted to login, enter your AWS account credentials\.

1. Choose the name of the instance from the **Instance Alias** column\.

SSML\-enhanced input text gives you more control over how Amazon Connect generates speech from the text you provide\. You can customize and control aspects of speech such as pronunciation, volume, and speed\.
