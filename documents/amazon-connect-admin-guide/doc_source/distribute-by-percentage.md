+ Inbound contact flow
+ Customer queue flow
+ Outbound Whisper flow
+ Transfer to Agent flow
+ Transfer to Queue flow

## Description<a name="disconnect-hang-up-description"></a>
+ This block is useful for doing A/B testing\. It routes customers randomly based on a percentage\.
+ Like flipping a coin, contacts are distributed randomly, which doesnâ€™t guarantee exact percentage splits\.

## How it works<a name="disconnect-hang-up-works"></a>

This block creates static allocation rules based on how you configure it\. Internal logic generates a random number between 1\-100\. This number identifies which branch to take\. It doesn't use current or historical volume as part of it's logic\.

For example, say a block is configure like this:
+ 20% = A
+ 40% = B
+ 40% remaining = Default

When contact a is being routed through a flow, Amazon Connect generates the random number\. 
+ If number is between 0\-20, the contact is routed down the A branch\.
+ Between 21\-60 it's routed down the B branch\.
+ Greater than 60 it's routed down the Default branch\.
