# How Initial delay affects Scheduled and In queue metrics<a name="scheduled-vs-inqueue"></a>

In the [Transfer to queue](transfer-to-queue.md) block, the **Initial delay** property affects when a callback is put in queue\. For example, assume **Initial delay** is set to 30 seconds\. Here's what appears in your real\-time metrics report:

1. After 20 seconds, the callback has already been created, but it is not yet in queue because of the **Initial delay** setting\.
