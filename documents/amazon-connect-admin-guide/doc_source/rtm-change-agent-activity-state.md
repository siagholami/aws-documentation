# Change the "Agent activity" status in a real\-time metrics report<a name="rtm-change-agent-activity-state"></a>

Agents manually set their status in the Contact Control Panel \(CCP\)\. However, on the real\-time metrics report, supervisors can manually change the **Agent Activity** status of an agent\. This overrides what the agent has set in the CCP\.

When you choose the **Agent Activity** column, you can select a status, such as **Offline**, **Available**, or **Break**\.
