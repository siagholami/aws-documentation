# My CCP URL ends with /ccp\#<a name="upgrade-browser-ccp"></a>

Upgrading to the latest CCP is easy\. If you want, you can try out the latest CCP and then at a later date make the switch\. Here's what you do:

1. **Try it out**: Change the URL in your browser from **/ccp\#** to **/ccp\-v2**\. The latest CCP appears automatically\. If you want, change it back to /ccp\# to return to the earlier CCP\. 

1. **Upgrade**: Change the URL in your browser from **/ccp\# **to **/ccp\-v2**\. Bookmark the URL\. 

1. If you access the CCP through the Amazon Connect console by choosing the phone icon on the top right of a page, you will be re\-directed according to the automatic upgrade date sent by email\. Please reach out to your Amazon Solution Architect if your request is more urgent\.
