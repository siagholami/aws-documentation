Real\-time metrics reports show real\-time or near\-real time metrics information about activity in your contact center\. Metrics such as **Online** show the number of agents currently online in real\-time, updating every 15 seconds\. Metrics such as **Handled** and **Abandoned** reflect near real\-time values for your contact center\.

You can customize the reports, specify a time range for each report, select metrics for each report, and select filters for data to include or exclude from each report\.
