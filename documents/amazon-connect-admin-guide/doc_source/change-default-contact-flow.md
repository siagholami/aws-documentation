# Change a default contact flow<a name="change-default-contact-flow"></a>

You can override the way the default flows work by editing them directly\. 

Generally we recommend creating new flows based on the defaults, rather than editing the default flow directly\. You can make a copy of the default flow, assign a name that indicates it's a custom version, and then edit that one\. This gives you more control over how your contact flows work\.
