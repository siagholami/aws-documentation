# Monitor Live Conversations<a name="listen-in"></a>

Managers can monitor live conversations between agents and customers, and review past conversations\. To set this up, you need to add the **Set call recording** block to your contact flow, assign managers the appropriate permissions, and then show them how to monitor the conversations\. 

**Important**  
The monitor feature works only when call recording is enabled on a contact flow\. For instructions on adding the **Set call recording** block to your contact flow, see [Set up Call Recording](set-up-recordings.md)\.
