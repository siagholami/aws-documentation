# Create a dev \(Sandbox\) or test \(QA\) instance<a name="create-connect-instance"></a>

You might want to create multiple contact center instances, for example, one as a Sandbox for development, another for QA, and a third for Production\. 

Each instance functions only within the AWS Region in which you create it\.

**Important**  
There's no way to migrate all resources between virtual contact center instances\. You can migrate some instance resources manually or with the assistance of AWS Support\. Other resources must be recreated\.  
For more information, see [Can I migrate my Amazon Connect instance from a test environment to a production environment?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/connect-migrate-instance-resources/)

1. In the AWS Management Console, choose **Amazon Connect**\.

1. Choose **Add an instance**\.

1. Complete the steps on the Amazon Connect resource configuration page\. For instructions see [Create an Amazon Connect instance](amazon-connect-instances.md)\.
