# Enable data streaming for your instance<a name="data-streaming"></a>

You can export contact trace records \(CTRs\) and agent events from Amazon Connect and perform real\-time analysis on contacts\. Data streaming sends data to Amazon Kinesis\.

**To enable data streaming for your instance**

1. Open the Amazon Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/connect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)\.

1. On the instances page, choose the instance alias\. The instance alias is also your **instance name**, which appears in your Amazon Connect URL\. For example, in **https://mytest88\.awsapps\.com/connect/home** the instance name is **mytest88**\.

   + Choose **Kinesis Firehose** and select an existing delivery stream, or choose **Create a new Kinesis firehose** to open the Kinesis Firehose console and create the delivery stream\.
   + Choose **Kinesis Stream** and select an existing stream, or choose **Create a new Kinesis firehose** to open the Kinesis console and create the stream\.

1. For **Agent Events**, select an existing Kinesis stream or choose **Create a new Kinesis stream** to open the Kinesis console and create the stream\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

## Using server\-side encryption for the Kinesis stream<a name="server-side-encryption-data-stream"></a>

If you enable server\-side encryption for the Kinesis stream you select, Amazon Connect cannot publish to the stream because it does not have permission to call `kms:GenerateDataKey` so that it can encrypt data sent to Kinesis\. To work\-around this, do the following steps: 

1. Enable encryption for recordings of conversations or scheduled reports\.

1. Create a customer master key \(CMK\) to use for encryption\.

1. Choose the same CMK for the Kinesis data stream that you use for scheduled reports or recordings of conversations\.
