1. Go to **Metrics and quality**, **Real\-time metrics**, **Queues**\.

To only see a count of the customers waiting for a call back, you need to create a queue that only takes callback contacts\. To learn how to do this, see [Set Up Routing](connect-queues.md)\.

Currently there isn't a way to see the phone numbers of the contacts waiting for callbacks\.
