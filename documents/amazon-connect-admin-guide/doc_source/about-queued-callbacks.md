# About queued callbacks in metrics<a name="about-queued-callbacks"></a>

This topic explains how queued callbacks appear in your real\-time metrics reports and the contact trace record \(CTR\)\.

**Tip**  
To see only the number of customers who are waiting for a call back, you need to create a queue that only takes callback contacts\. To learn how to do this, see [Set up routing](connect-queues.md)\. Currently there isn't a way to see the phone numbers of the contacts waiting for callbacks\.

1. Callbacks are initiated when the [Transfer to queue](transfer-to-queue.md) block transfers the initial contact to a callback queue\.

1. The callback is then placed in the queue\. It remains there until an agent is available and can be offered the contact\.

1. When the callback is connected to the agent, a new CTR is created for the contact\.

1. The **Initiation Timestamp** in the callback CTR corresponds to when the [Transfer to queue](transfer-to-queue.md) block transferred the contact to a callback queue, shown in step 1\.

## How properties in the Transfer to Queue block affect this flow<a name="transfer-to-queue-properties"></a>

The [Transfer to queue](transfer-to-queue.md) block has the following properties, which affect how Amazon Connect handles the callback:
+ **Initial delay**: This property affects when a callback is put in queue\. Specify how much time has to pass between a callback contact being initiated in the contact flow, and the customer being put in queue for the next available agent\. For more information, see [How Initial delay affects Scheduled and In queue metrics](scheduled-vs-inqueue.md)\. 
+ **Maximum amount of attempts**: Think of this as the maximum number of retries\. If this is set to 2, then Amazon Connect tries to call the customer at most three times: the initial callback, and two retries\. 
+ **Minimum time between attempts**: If the customer doesn't answer the phone, this is how long to wait before trying again\.
