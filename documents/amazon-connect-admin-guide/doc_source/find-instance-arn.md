1. Open the Amazon Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/connect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)\.

1. On the instances page, click on the instance alias\. The instance alias is also your **instance name**, which appears in your Amazon Connect URL\. For example, in **https://mytest88\.awsapps\.com/connect/home** the instance name is **mytest88**\.
