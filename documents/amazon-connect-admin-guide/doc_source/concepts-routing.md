Amazon Connect includes a default routing profile named **Basic routing profile**\. Along with the [default contact flows](contact-flow-default.md) and default queue \(named **BasicQueue**\), it powers your contact center so you don't need to do any customization\. This is what enables you to get started quickly\. 

## Routing Profiles Link Queues and Agents<a name="concepts-routing-profiles-queues"></a>

When you create a routing profile, you specify: 
+ The channels the agents will support\.
+ The queues of customers that the agents will handle\. You can use a single queue to handle all incoming contacts, or you can set up multiple queues\. Queues are linked to agents through a routing profile\.
+ Priority and delay of the queues\.
