# Set your status to available<a name="set-status-available"></a>

When an agent is ready to handle calls or chats, they need to set their status in the CCP to **Available**\. This tells Amazon Connect they are ready to handle contacts\.

Amazon Connect uses information in the agent's [routing profile](routing-profiles.md) to determine which contacts to route to them\.
