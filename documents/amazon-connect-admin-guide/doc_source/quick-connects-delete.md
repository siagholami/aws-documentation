# Delete quick connects<a name="quick-connects-delete"></a>

At this time you can't delete quick connects\. You can reuse them by changing the type, destination, and contact flow on the **Quick connects** page\.

Or, you can remove them from a queue on the **Edit queue** page so that agents can't see them in the Contact Control Panel \(CCP\)\.
