# Disable a queue<a name="disable-a-queue"></a>

You can quickly control the flow of contacts to queues by temporarily disabling a queue\. When a queue is disabled, it's put in an offline mode\. No new contacts are routed to the queue, but any existing contacts already in the queue are routed to agents\. 

Only users who have a security profile with **Queues \- Enable/Disable** permissions can disable a queue\.
