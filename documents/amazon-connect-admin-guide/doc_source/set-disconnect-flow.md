## Contact flow types<a name="set-disconnect-flow-types"></a>

You can use this block in the following [contact flow types](create-contact-flow.md#contact-flow-types):
+ All flows

## Description<a name="set-disconnect-flow-description"></a>
+ Specifies which contact flow to run after a disconnect event during a conversation\. A disconnect event is when an agent disconnects\. When the disconnect event occurs, the corresponding content flow runs\. 
+ Here are examples of when you might use this block:
  + Run post\-call surveys\. For example, the agent asks the customer to remain on the line for a post\-call survey\. The agent hangs up and a disconnect flow is run\. In the disconnect flow, the customer is asked a set of questions using the [Get customer input](get-customer-input.md) block\. Their answers are uploaded using an [Invoke AWS Lambda function](invoke-lambda-function-block.md) block to an external customer feedback database\. The customer is thanked and disconnected\.

    For more information about creating post\-call surveys, see this blog post by an AWS Solution Architect: [Create post call surveys in Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/create-post-call-surveys-in-amazon-connect/)\.
  + In a chat scenario, if a customer stops responding to the chat, use this block to decide whether to run the disconnect flow and call a [Wait](wait.md) block, or end the conversation\.
