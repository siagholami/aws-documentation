## Tips for viewing a shared report<a name="tips-view-a-shared-report"></a>
+ Every time you want to view the shared report, you need to access it through the link that was shared with you\.
+ If you get a 505 error when you choose the link that was shared with you, it means you don't have permissions to view the report\.
+ There's no way to save the exact same report to your list of Saved reports\. You can give the report a new name and save it to your list, but then it's a different report from the one that was shared with you\. If the owner of original report makes changes, you won't see them in your renamed report\.
