This block gives you two options for changing a customer's position in queue: 
+ **Set priority**\. The default priority for new contacts is 5\. You can raise the priority of a contact \- compared to other contacts in the queue \- by assigning them a higher priority, such as 1 or 2\. 
+ **Adjust by time**\. You can add or subtract seconds or minutes from the amount of time the current contact spends in queue\. Contacts are routed to agents on a first\-come, first\-served basis\. So changing their amount of time in queue compared to others also changes their position in queue\.

Here's how this block works:

1. Amazon Connect takes the actual “time in queue” for the contact \(in this case, how long this specific contact has spent in queue so far\), and adds the number of seconds you specified in the **Adjust by time** property\.

1. The additional seconds makes this specific contact look artificially older than it is\. 

1. The routing system now perceives this contact’s “time in queue” as longer than it actually is, which affects its position within the ranked list\.
