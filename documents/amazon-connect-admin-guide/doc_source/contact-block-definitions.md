# Contact block definitions<a name="contact-block-definitions"></a>

You create contact flows in the contact flow designer using contact blocks\. Drag and drop contact blocks onto a canvas to arrange a contact flow\. 

The following table lists all available contact blocks that you can use\. Choose the links in the Block column for more information\.
