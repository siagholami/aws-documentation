# Flow control actions in the Amazon Connect Flow language<a name="flow-control-actions"></a>

These actions don't have any side effects and are only used to determine the path through a flow\. Certain data may not be available \(such as contact data, if the action is determining its path based on contact data\)\. These actions generally work in every circumstance\.

A flow control action is an action that:
+ Does not need a contact or a participant to succeed\.
+ Controls the behavior of the flow, by either enabling or disabling flow behavior \(such as logging\) or by choosing a branch when the flow runs\.
