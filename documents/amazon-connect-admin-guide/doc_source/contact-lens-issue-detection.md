# About issue/call driver detection in Contact Lens<a name="contact-lens-issue-detection"></a>

In the analyzed files that Contact Lens creates, and in the Amazon Connect console, you can identify potential customer issues \(also known as call drivers\) that need further investigation\. 

Contact Lens highlights the primary call driver or reason for the customer outreach in the call transcript\. You can use this information to identify common emerging patterns across customer conversations\.

Unlike the categorization of contacts, you don't need to configure issue detection to use this feature\. Issues are detected based on an artificial intelligence analysis of each turn in the conversation\.

**Tip**  
Issues are highlighted only in conversations that occur after the release of the issue detection feature\.
