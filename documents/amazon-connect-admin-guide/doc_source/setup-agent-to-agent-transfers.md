# Set up agent\-to\-agent transfers<a name="setup-agent-to-agent-transfers"></a>

We recommend using these instructions to set up agent\-to\-agent voice and chat transfers\. You use a [Set working queue](set-working-queue.md) block to transfer the contact to the agent's queue\. The **Set working queue **block supports an omnichannel experience, whereas the [Transfer to agent \(beta\)](transfer-to-agent-block.md) block does not\.

## Step 1: Create the quick connect<a name="step1-create-quick-connect"></a>

**Create a quick connect**

1. Enter a name for the connect\. Choose the type, and then specify the destination \(such as a phone number or the name of an agent\), contact flow \(if applicable\), and description\.
