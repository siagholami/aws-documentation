# Claim a phone number in your country<a name="claim-phone-number"></a>

To place or receive calls in your instance, you need to claim a phone number\. If you did not claim a number when you created the instance, follow these steps to claim one now\.

**To claim a number for your contact center**

1. Log in to your contact center using your access URL \(https://*domain*\.awsapps\.com/connect/login\)\.

1. Choose **Routing**, **Phone numbers**\.

1. Choose **Claim a number**\. You can choose a toll free number or a Direct Inward Dialing \(DID\) number\.
**Note**  
Use the [Amazon Connect service quotas increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-connect) for these situations:   
If you select a country, but there are no numbers displayed for that country, you can request additional numbers for the country\. 
If you want to request a specific area code or prefix that you don't see listed, we'll try to accommodate your request\.

1. Enter a description for the number and, if required, attach it to a contact flow in **Contact flow / IVR**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. Repeat this process until you have claimed all your required phone numbers\.

There is a service quota for how many phone numbers you can have in each instance\. For the default service quota, see [Amazon Connect service quotas](amazon-connect-service-limits.md)\. If you reach your quota, but want a different phone number, you can release one of previously claimed numbers\. You cannot claim the same phone number after releasing it\. 

If you need more phone numbers, you can request a service quota increase using the [Amazon Connect service quota increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-connect)\.
