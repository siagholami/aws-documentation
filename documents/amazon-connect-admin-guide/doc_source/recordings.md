# Review Recorded Conversations<a name="recordings"></a>

Managers can review past conversations between agents and customers\. To set this up, you need to [set up recording behavior](set-up-recordings.md), assign managers the appropriate permissions, and then show them how to access the recorded conversations\. 

A conversation is recorded only when the contact is connected to an agent\. The contact is not recorded before then, when they are connected to the IVR\.
