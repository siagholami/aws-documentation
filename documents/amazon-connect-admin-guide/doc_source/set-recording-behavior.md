When configuring this block to [set up recording behavior](set-up-recordings.md), choose as follows:
+ To record voice conversations, choose what you want to record: **Agent and Customer**, **Agent only**, or **Customer only**\.
+ To record chat conversations, you need to choose **Agent and Customer**\.
+ To enable monitoring of voice and/or chat conversations, you need to choose **Agent and Customer**\.

For information about using this block to enable Contact Lens, see [Enable Contact Lens for Amazon Connect](enable-analytics.md)\.

## Configuration tips<a name="set-recording-behavior-tips"></a>
+ Let's say you have a flow that links to a flow that links to another flow\. Each flow might have it's own **Set recording behavior** block\. The last **Set recording behavior** block overrides the settings of the previous two **Set recording behavior** blocks\. 

  For example, you might have a contact flow with **Set recording behavior to record Agent and Customer**\. But if the next **Set recording behavior** block is set to **Agent only**, that block overrides the behavior of the previous block\. 
+ If an agent puts a customer on hold, the agent is still recorded, but the customer is not\.
+ If you want to transfer a contact to another agent or queue, and you want to continue using Contact Lens to collect data, you need to add to the flow another **Set recording behavior** block with **Enable analytics** turn on\. This is because a transfer generates a second contact ID and CTR\. Contact Lens needs to run on that CTR as well\.
