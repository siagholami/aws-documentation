# Create alerts for contact flow log events<a name="contact-flow-log-alerts"></a>

You can configure CloudWatch to define a filter pattern that looks for specific events in your contact flow logs and then creates an alert when an entry for that event is added to the log\. 

For example, you can set an alert for when a contact flow block goes down an error path as a customer interacts with the flow\. Log entries are typically available in CloudWatch within a short time, giving you near real\-time notification of events in contact flows\.
