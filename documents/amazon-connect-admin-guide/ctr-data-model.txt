Contact trace records (CTR) data model
This article describes the data model for Amazon Connect contact trace records (CTRs). CTRs capture the events associated with a contact in your contact center. Real-time and historical metrics are based on the data captured in the CTRs.
For the CTR retention period and maximum size of the CTR attributes section, see Feature specifications.
Tip
Amazon Connect delivers CTRs at least once. CTRs may be delivered again for multiple reasons, such as new information arriving after initial delivery. If you're building a system that consumes CTR export streams, be sure to include logic that checks for duplicate CTRs for a contact. Use the LastUpdateTimestamp property to determine if a copy contains new data than previous copies. Then use the ContactId property for deduplication.

InitiationMethod
Indicates how the contact was initiated.
Valid values:
  INBOUND: The customer initiates voice (phone) contact with your contact center. 
  OUTBOUND: An agent initiates voice (phone) contact with the customer, by using the CCP to call their number. This initiation method calls the StartOutboundVoiceContact API.
  TRANSFER: The customer is transferred by an agent to another agent or to a queue, using quick connects in the CCP. This results in a new CTR being created.
  CALLBACK: The customer is contacted as part of a callback flow. 
For more information about the InitiationMethod in this scenario, see About queued callbacks in metrics. 
  API: The contact was initiated with Amazon Connect by API. This could be an outbound contact you created and queued to an agent, using the StartOutboundVoiceContact API, or it could be a live chat that was initiated by the customer with your contact center, where you called the StartChatConnect API.
  QUEUE_TRANSFER: While the customer is in one queue (listening to Customer queue flow), they are transferred into another queue using a contact flow block.
InitiationTimestamp
The date and time this contact was initiated, in UTC time. For INBOUND, this is when the contact arrived. For OUTBOUND, this is when the agent began dialing. For CALLBACK, this is when the callback contact was created. For TRANSFER and QUEUE_TRANSFER, this is when the transfer was initiated. For API, this is when the request arrived.

How to identify abandoned contacts
An abandoned contact refers to a contact that was disconnected by the customer while in queue. This means that they weren't connected to an agent. 
The CTR for an abandoned contact has a Queue, and an Enqueue Timestamp because it was enqueued. It won’t have a ConnectedToAgentTimestamp, or any of the other fields that populate only after the contact has been connected to an agent.
