Search for recordings by contact ID
To find a recording of a specific contact, you only need the contact ID. You don't need to know the date range, agent, or any other information about the contact. 


Log in to Amazon Connect with a user account that has permissions to access recordings.


In Amazon Connect choose Metrics and quality, Contact search. 


In the Contact ID, enter the contact ID, and then choose Search.


Conversations that were recorded have icons in the Recording/Transcript column. If you don't have the appropriate permissions, you won't see these icons. 



To learn more about searching, see Contact search.
