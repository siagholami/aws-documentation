Contact block: Transfer to phone number
Contact flow types
You can use this block in the following contact flow types:
 Inbound contact flow
 Customer Queue flow
 Transfer to Agent flow
 Transfer to Queue flow
Description

Transfers the customer to a phone number external to your instance.
If this block is triggered during a chat conversation, the contact is routed down the Error branch.

Properties

Note the following properties:
 Resume contact flow after disconnect: This works only if the external party disconnects, and the customer doesn't disconnect. (If the customer disconnects, the whole call disconnects.)
 Send DTMF: This property is useful to bypass some of the DTMF of the external party. For example, if you know you'll need to press 1, 1, 362 to reach the external party, you can enter that here.
 Caller ID number: You can choose a number from your instance to appear as the caller ID. This is useful in cases where you want to use a number that's different from the one the contact flow is actually using to make the call.
Important
If you are using Amazon Connect outside of the United States, we recommend choosing Caller ID number and then selecting an Amazon Connect number. Otherwise, local regulations may cause telephony providers to block or redirect non-Amazon Connect phone numbers. This will result in service-related events, such as poor audio quality, delay, latency, and displaying the incorrect caller ID. 
 Caller ID name: You can set a caller ID name, but there's no guarantee it will appear correctly to the customer. For more information, see Why your caller ID might not appear correctly to customers.
Configuration tips

Submit a service quota increase request requesting that your business be allowed to make outbound calls to the country you specified. If your business is not on the allow list for making the call, it will fail. For more information, see Countries you can call.
If the country you want to select is not listed, you can submit a request to add countries you want to transfer calls to using the Amazon Connect service quotas increase form.
You can choose to end the contact flow when the call is transferred, or choose to Resume contact flow after disconnect, which returns the caller to your instance and resumes the contact flow after the transferred call ends.
