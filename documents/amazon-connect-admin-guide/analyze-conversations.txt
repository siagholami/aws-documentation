Analyze conversations using Contact Lens for Amazon Connect
Contact Lens for Amazon Connect lets you analyze customer-agent conversations, by using speech transcription, natural language processing, and intelligent search capabilities. It performs sentiment analysis and automatically indexes call transcripts so that you can search for specific words/phrases. This enables supervisors to identify recurring themes, and discover opportunities to coach agents so that they can continually improve the customer experience. 
The results of the sentiment analysis appear in the customer's Contact Trace Record (CTR). The following image shows a portion of a CTR with sentiment analysis.
