Claim a phone number in your country
To place or receive calls in your instance, you need to claim a phone number. If you did not claim a number when you created the instance, follow these steps to claim one now.
To claim a number for your contact center


Log in to your contact center using your access URL (https://domain.awsapps.com/connect/login).


Choose Routing, Phone numbers.


Choose Claim a number. You can choose a toll free number or a Direct Inward Dialing (DID) number.
Note
Use the Amazon Connect service quotas increase form for these situations: 
If you select a country, but there are no numbers displayed for that country, you can request additional numbers for the country. 
If you want to request a specific area code or prefix that you don't see listed, we'll try to accommodate your request.


Enter a description for the number and, if required, attach it to a contact flow in Contact flow / IVR.


Choose Save.


Repeat this process until you have claimed all your required phone numbers.


There is a service quota for how many phone numbers you can have in each instance. For the default service quota, see Amazon Connect service quotas. If you reach your quota, but want a different phone number, you can release one of previously claimed numbers. You cannot claim the same phone number after releasing it. 
If you need more phone numbers, you can request a service quota increase using the Amazon Connect service quota increase form.
