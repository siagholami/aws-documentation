Transfer chats to another queue
When a chat is transferred from a bot to an agent, or from an agent to another queue, all context is preserved. This context lets the next agent read all previous messages in that contact.
To transfer a customer to another queue


Choose the Quick Connect button at the bottom of the CCP page.



Choose or search for the queue you want to transfer to, and then choose the transfer button.


You'll see a confirmation message. You're now doing After Contact Work (ACW) for the customer. Choose Close to end the contact.
