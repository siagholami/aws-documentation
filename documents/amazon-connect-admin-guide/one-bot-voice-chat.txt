How to use the same bot for voice and chat
You can use the same bot for both voice and chat. However, you may want the bot to respond differently based on the channel. For example, you want to return SSML for voice so a number is read as a phone number but you want to return normal text to chat. You can do this by passing the Channel attribute.


In the Get customer input block, choose the Amazon Lex tab.


Under Session attributes, choose Use attribute. Enter phoneNumber, and set to System, Customer Number, as shown in the following image. 



Choose Add another attribute.


Select Use attribute. Enter callType, System, Channel, as shown in the following image.



Choose Save.


In your Lambda function, you can access this value in the SessionAttributes field in the incoming event.
