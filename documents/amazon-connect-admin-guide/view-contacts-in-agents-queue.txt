To see how many contacts are in an agent's personal queue, add an Agent queues table to your Real-time metrics, Queues report. Then view these two metrics: 
 In Queue—how many contacts are in an agent's personal queue.
 Queued—the number of contacts added to their personal queue during the specified time range.
Use the following procedure. 


Go to Metrics and quality, Real-time metrics, Queues.


Choose New table, Agent queues.



The In queue column displays how many contacts are in the agent's queue.

Review the metrics in then In queue and Queue columns.
