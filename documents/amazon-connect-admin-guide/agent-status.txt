Customize Agent Status Values
The agent's status is set manually in the Contact Control Panel (CCP). The status is used for reporting, metrics, and resource management.
Amazon Connect provides two default statuses: 
 Available
 Offline
You can change the name of these statuses, and you can add new statuses. For example, you might add a status for Break, and another for Training.
When you add a new status, it will always be Custom, not routable. 
You can't delete a status but you can disable it so it doesn't appear on the agent's CCP.
To add a new agent status


Choose Users, Agent status, Add new agent status.


Enter a status name and description, and select whether the status should appear in the CCP to the agent.


Choose Save.


To change the order that the statuses appear in the CCP, click the waffle next to the state and drag it to the order you want. 

To edit a status


Choose Users, Agent status.


Hover over the status name and choose the edit icon.


Enter the new information, and choose Save to apply the changes.


Choose View Historical Changes to view the change history. You can filter changes by date (between two dates) or by user name. If you cannot see the View historical changes link, ensure that you have the proper permissions to view these changes.
