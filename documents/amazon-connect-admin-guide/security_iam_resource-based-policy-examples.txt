Amazon Connect resource-based policy examples
Amazon Connect supports resource-level permissions for IAM users, so you can specify actions for them for an instance, as shown in the following policies.
Deny the "delete" and "update" actions
This following sample policy denies the "delete" and "update" actions for users in one Amazon Connect instance. It uses a wild card at the end of the Amazon Connect user ARN so that "delete user" and "update user" are denied on the full user ARN (that is, all Amazon Connect users in the provided instance, such as arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/00fbeee1-123e-111e-93e3-11111bfbfcc1/agent/00dtcddd1-123e-111e-93e3-11111bfbfcc1).
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "connect:DeleteUser",
                "connect:UpdateUser*"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/00fbeee1-123e-111e-93e3-11111bfbfcc1/agent/*"
        }
    ]
}
Allow "create users" but deny if you're assigned to a specific security profile
The following sample policy allows "create users" but explicitly denies using arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/00fbeee1-123e-111e-93e3-11111bfbfcc1/security-profile/11dtcggg1-123e-111e-93e3-11111bfbfcc17 as the parameter for security profile in CreateUser request.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",        
            "Action": [
                "connect:CreateUser"
             ],
            "Resource": "*",
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "connect:CreateUser"
             ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/00fbeee1-123e-111e-93e3-11111bfbfcc17/security-profile/11dtcggg1-123e-111e-93e3-11111bfbfcc17",
        } 
    ]
}
Allow recording actions on a contact
The following sample policy allows "start contact recording" on a contact in a specific instance. Since contactID is dynamic, * is used.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
          "connect:StartContactRecording"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:accountID:instance/instanceId/contact/*",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
Set up a trusted relationship with accountID.
The following actions are defined for the recording APIs:
 "connect:StartContactRecording"
 "connect:StopContactRecording"
 "connect:SuspendContactRecording"
 "connect:ResumeContactRecording"
Allow more contact Actions in the same role
If the same role is used to calling other contact APIs, you can list the following contact actions:
 GetContactAttributes
 ListContactFlows
 StartChatContact
 StartOutboundVoiceContact
 StopContact
 UpdateContactAttributes
Or use a wildcard to allow all contact actions, for example: "connect:*"
Allow more resources
You can also use a wildcard to allow more resources. For example, here's how to allow contact actions on all contact resources:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "connect:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:accountID:instance/*/contact/*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
