Types of contact attributes
The following types of contact attributes are available in Amazon Connect.
System contact attributes
These are predefined attributes in Amazon Connect. You can reference system attributes, but you cannot create them. 
Some system attributes relate to contacts, and some relate to metrics. Not all blocks in a contact flow support using System attributes. For example, you cannot use a System attribute to store customer input. Instead, use a user-defined attribute to store the data input by a customer.
Agent contact attributes
A subset of system attributes related to agents in your contact center.
Agent attributes are available only in the following types of contact flows:
 Agent whisper
 Customer whisper
 Agent hold
 Customer whisper
 Outbound whisper
 Transfer to agent. In this case, the Agent attributes reflect the target agent, not the one who initiated the transfer.
Agent attributes are not available in the following contact flow types:
 Customer queue
 Transfer to queue
 Inbound contact flow
Queue metrics contact attributes
These are System metric attributes returned when you use a Get queue metrics block in your contact flow.
User-defined contact attributes
These attributes are created when a contact flow runs using Set contact attributes blocks. When you get data from an external source, you can copy key-value pairs as user-defined attributes to reference later in a contact flow. You can also create user-defined attributes through the Amazon Connect API.
User-defined attributes include all attributes set by using a Set contact attributes block in a contact flow. User-defined attributes are included in contact trace records (CTRs). They are available to Lambda functions that are invoked after the Set contact attributes block, and are created in the Attributes namespace. They are also available to applications that integrate with the Contact Control Panel (CCP) for screenpop information, and can be referenced in contact flows.
External contact attributes
Externalâ€”Attributes are created via a process external to Amazon Connect. For example, when you use an Invoke AWS Lambda function block in a contact flow, or integrate with an Amazon Lex bot.
External attributes are returned as key-value pairs from the most recent invocation of an Invoke AWS Lambda function block. External attributes are overwritten with each invocation of the Lambda function. You can access external attributes in contact flows via $.External.AttributeName. For more information about using attributes in Lambda functions, see Using AWS Lambda Functions with Amazon Connect.
These attributes are not included in CTRs, not passed to the next Lambda invocation, and not passed to the CCP for screenpop information. However, they can be passed as Lambda function inputs on an Invoke AWS Lambda function block, or copied to user-defined attributes via the Set contact attributes block. When used in Set contact attributes blocks, the attributes that are copied are included in CTRs, and can be used in the CCP.
Lex slots contact attributes
External attributes for the slot name of an Amazon Lex bot.
Lex attributes
Session attributes from an Amazon Lex bot interaction.
