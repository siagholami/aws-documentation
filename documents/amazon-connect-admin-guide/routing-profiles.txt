Each agent is assigned to one routing profile.

Tips for setting up channels and concurrency

Use Set channels and concurrency to toggle on and off whether agents assigned to a profile get voice and chat contacts.

When you want to restart voice contacts for these agents again, select Voice. 
 For each queue in the profile, choose whether it's for voice or chat contacts, or both. 
 If you want a queue to handle both voice and chat contacts, but want to assign a different priority to each channel, add the queue twice, like this:
