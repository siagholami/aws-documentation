Download a historical metrics report
You can download the data included in a report as a comma-separated value (CSV) file so you can use it with other applications. If there's no data for one of the selected metrics, the field in the downloaded CSV file contains a dash.
Important
From the Amazon Connect console, you can only download the results currently displayed on the page. For example, if there are 256 results, but only 100 are displayed on the page at a time, you would need to download the data in three batches (1-100, 101-200, 201-256). For a workaround, see Download all historical metric results. 
To download a historical metrics report as a CSV file


Log in to your contact center using your access URL (https://domain.awsapps.com/connect/login).


Create a new report or open a saved report.


Choose the down arrow next to Save in the top-right corner of the page and choose Download CSV.


When prompted, confirm whether to open or save the file.


Although the times in the online report are in hh:mm:ss, all times in the downloaded report are in seconds.

You can convert the seconds to minutes using an Excel formula. Alternatively, if you have a short report, you can copy and paste the data from Amazon Connect to Excel and it will preserve the format.
