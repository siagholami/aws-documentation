Sample disconnect flow
Type: Contact flow (inbound)
This contact flow only works for chat conversations.


The Play prompt block shows a text message that the agent has disconnected.


A Wait block sets the timeout period for 15 minutes. If the customer returns in 15 minutes, the customer is transferred to a queue to chat with another agent. 


If the customer doesn't return, the timer expires and the chat disconnects.
