All domains that embed the CCP for a particular instance must be explicitly allowed for cross-domain access to the instance. For example, to integrate with Salesforce, you must place your Salesforce Visualforce domain in an allow list.
To allow a domain URL


Open the Amazon Connect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/.


Choose the name of the instance from Instance Alias.
