Part 2: Add intents to your Amazon Lex bot
An intent is the action the user wants to perform. In this part, add two intents to the bot. Each intent represents a reason that users call the Help Desk: password reset and network issues.


In the Amazon Lex console, choose the Editor tab.



Choose the  icon next to Intents, and choose Create new intent.


In the Add intent box, choose  Create intent.



Name the intent PasswordReset and choose Add.



Choose the  icon next to Intents again, and add an intent for NetworkIssue.
