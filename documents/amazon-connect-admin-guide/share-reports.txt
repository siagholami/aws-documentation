Share custom reports
You can only share reports that you create and save. This means you need the following permissions in your security profile to share reports: Access metrics and Create saved reports. 

To share reports

On the report page, choose Share report. 


Or, from your list of saved reports, choose the Share report icon. 


Choose Copy link address and choose Save. This saves the link to your clipboard. Paste this link into an email or other location to share the report.


You don't need to publish the report to your organization in order to share the link with specific people.
Important
Anyone who has the link and the appropriate permissions can access the report.
