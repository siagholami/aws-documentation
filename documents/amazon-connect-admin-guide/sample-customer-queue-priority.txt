Sample customer queue priority
Type: Contact flow (inbound)
Note
This sample flow is available in previous Amazon Connect instances. In new instances, you can see this functionality in Sample queue configurations. 
By default the priority for new contacts is 5. Lower values raise the priority of the contact. For example, a contact assigned a priority of 1 is routed first.
This sample shows how you can use the Change routing priority/age block to raise or lower the priority of a contact in a queue. Using this block, there are two ways you can raise or lower a customer's priority: 
 Assign them a new priority value, such as 1, to raise their priority.
 Or, increase the routing age of the contact. Customers who are queued longer are routed first, when all contacts have the same queue priority value (such as 5).
Option 1: Raise the priority

The Get Customer Input block prompts the customer to press 1 to move to the front of the queue. This block gets the customer's input; it doesn't actually change the customer's priority. 
If the customer presses 1, they go down the "Pressed 1" branch, which takes them to the Change routing priority/age block. This block changes their priority in the queue to 1, which is the highest priority. 

Option 2: Change the routing age

The Get Customer Input block prompts the customer to press 2 to move behind existing contacts already in queue. This block gets the customer's input; it doesn't actually change the customer's priority. 
If the customer presses 2, they go down the "Pressed 2" branch, which takes them to a different Change routing priority/age block. This block increases their routing age by 10 minutes. This has the effect of moving them ahead of others in the queue who have been waiting longer.
