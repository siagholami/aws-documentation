 All flows
Description

Sets the text-to-speech (TTS) language and voice to use for the contact flow.
The default voice is configured to Joanna (Conversational speaking style), an Amazon Polly Neural Text-to-Speech (NTTS) voice. Neural voices make automated conversations sound more lifelike by improving the pitch, inflection, intonation, and tempo.
After this block is run, any TTS invocation resolves to the neural or standard voice selected.
If this block is triggered during a chat conversation, the contact goes down the Success branch. It has no effect on the chat experience.
