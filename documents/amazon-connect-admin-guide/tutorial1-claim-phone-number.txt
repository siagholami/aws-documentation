Step 3: Claim a phone number
In this step, you set up a phone number so that you can experiment with Amazon Connect.


On the navigation menu, choose Routing, Phone numbers. 



On the right side of the page, choose Claim a number.



Select the DID (Direct Inward Dialing) tab. Use the drop-down arrow to choose your country/region. When numbers are returned, choose one.



Write down the phone number. You call it later in this tutorial.


In the Description box, type this note: this number is for testing.



In the Contact flow / IVR box, choose the drop-down arrow, and then choose Sample inbound flow (first contact experience).


Choose Save.


Congratulations! You set up your instance and claimed a phone number. Now you're ready to experience how chat and voice work in Amazon Connect. Go to Tutorial 2: Test the sample voice and chat experience.
