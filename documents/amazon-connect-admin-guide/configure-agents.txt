Configure agent settings: routing profile, phone type, and auto-accept calls
Before you configure your agent settings, here is some info to have on hand. Of course, you can always change this information later. 
 What is their routing profile? They can only be assigned one. 
 Will they have the Agent security profile or a custom profile you created? 
 Are they going to use a soft phone? If so, will they be connected to contacts automatically, or will they need to press the Accept button in their Contact Control Panel (CCP)?
 Or, are they going to use a desk phone? If so, what is their number?
 How many seconds do they have for After contact work (ACW)?
 Are they going to be assigned to an agent hierarchy?
Note
You can't configure how long an available agent has to connect with a contact before it's missed. Agents have 20 seconds to accept or reject a contact. If no action is taken, the current agent's status will be Missed and the contact is routed to the next available agent.
To configure agent settings


In the navigation pane, go to Users, User management.


Choose the user you want to configure, then choose Edit.


Assign a routing profile to them. You can only assign one.


Assign the Agent security profile, unless you've created custom security profiles.


Under Phone Type choose whether the agent is using a desk phone or soft phone. 
    If you select desk phone, enter their phone number.
Important
Outbound telephony charges occur when using a desk phone to answer inbound calls.
    If you select soft phone, choose Auto-Accept Call if you want agents to be connected to calls automatically. This doesn't apply to chats. 


In After call work (ACW) timeout, type how many seconds agents have for after contact work, such as entering notes about the contact.



Under Agent Hierarchy select any groups the agent should be part of.
