Requirements for Custom Termination Points
In the Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region, you can request Custom Termination Points.
The term "Custom Termination Points" means custom Tier 1 telephony destinations for customer calls to Amazon Connect configured as local phone numbers. In using Custom Termination Points, you understand and agree that you: 


Have a current toll-free national service that allows you to set Custom Termination Points as a destination for customer phone calls.


Cannot port or move Custom Termination Points to a different telephony provider once assigned by Amazon Connect.


Will be billed at the standard daily rate for claimed Australian phone numbers and DID inbound usage fees.


You are responsible for adding the Custom Termination Points in your existing toll-free national service.
