View how many contacts are waiting in queue
To see the number of customers waiting in queue


Go to Metrics and quality, Real-time metrics, Queues.


By default, customers who are waiting for a call back are counted in the In queue column. This column counts all customers who are in a queue for an agent, not just the callback customers.
