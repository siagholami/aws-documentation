Support for connectivity through AWS PrivateLink
You can establish a private connection between your VPC and EC2 Image Builder by creating an interface VPC endpoint. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access Image Builder APIs without an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC don't need public IP addresses to communicate with Image Builder APIs. Traffic between your VPC and Image Builder does not leave the Amazon network.
