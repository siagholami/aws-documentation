This topic describes the recommended process for verifying the validity of the installation download for the awstoe application on Linux-based operating systems. 
Whenever you download an application from the internet, we recommend that you authenticate the identity of the software publisher and check that the application is not altered or corrupted since it was published. This protects you from installing a version of the application that contains a virus or other malicious code.
If after running the steps in this topic, you determine that the software for the awstoe application is altered or corrupted, do NOT run the installation file. Instead, contact AWS Support.
awstoe application files for Linux-based operating systems are signed using GnuPG, an open source implementation of the Pretty Good Privacy (OpenPGP) standard for secure digital signatures. GnuPG (also known as GPG) provides authentication and integrity checking through a digital signature. Amazon EC2 publishes a public key and signatures that you can use to verify the downloaded Amazon EC2 CLI tools. For more information about PGP and GnuPG (GPG), see http://www.gnupg.org.
The first step is to establish trust with the software publisher. Download the public key of the software publisher, check that the owner of the public key is who they claim to be, and then add the public key to your keyring. Your keyring is a collection of known public keys. After you establish the authenticity of the public key, you can use it to verify the signature of the application.

Installing the GPG tools
If your operating system is Linux or Unix, the GPG tools are likely already installed. To test whether the tools are installed on your system, type gpg at a command prompt. If the GPG tools are installed, you see a GPG command prompt. If the GPG tools are not installed, you see an error stating that the command cannot be found. You can install the GnuPG package from a repository. 
To install GPG tools on Debian-based Linux
 From a terminal, run the following command: apt-get install gnupg.
To install GPG tools on Red Hatâ€“based Linux
 From a terminal, run the following command: yum install gnupg.
Authenticating and importing the public key
The next step in the process is to authenticate the awstoe public key and add it as a trusted key in your GPG keyring.
To authenticate and import the awstoe public key


Obtain a copy of our public GPG build key by doing one of the following:
    Download the key from https://awstoe-.s3..amazonaws.com/assets/awstoe.gpg. For example, https://awstoe-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/assets/awstoe.gpg.
    Copy the key from the following text and paste it into a file called awstoe.gpg. Make sure to include everything that follows:
```

 -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
 ```


At a command prompt in the directory where you saved awstoe.gpg, use the following command to import the awstoe public key into your keyring:


gpg --import awstoe.gpg
The command returns results that are similar to the following:
gpg: key F5AEBC52: public key "AWSTOE <awstoe@amazon.com>" imported
   gpg: Total number processed: 1
   gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
Make a note of the key value; you need it in the next step. In the preceding example, the key value is F5AEBC52.

Verify the fingerprint by running the following command, replacing key-value with the value from the preceding step:

gpg --fingerprint key-value
This command returns results similar to the following:
pub   2048R/F5AEBC52 2020-07-19
         Key fingerprint = F6DD E01C 869F D639 15E5  5742 DEBD C156 F5AE BC52
   uid       [ unknown] AWSTOE <awstoe@amazon.com>
Additionally, the fingerprint string should be identical to F6DD E01C 869F D639 15E5 5742 DEBD C156 F5AE BC52, as shown in the preceding example. Compare the key fingerprint that is returned to the one published on this page. They should match. If they don't match, don't install the awstoe application installation script, and contact AWS Support. 
Verify the signature of the package
After you install the GPG tools, authenticate and import the awstoe public key, and verify that the public key is trusted, you are ready to verify the signature of the installation script. 
To verify the installation script signature

At a command prompt, run the following command to download the application binary:

curl -O https://awstoe-<region>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/latest/linux/<architecture>/awstoe
For example:
curl -O https://awstoe-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/linux/amd64/awstoe
Supported values for architecture can be amd64, 386, and arm64.

At a command prompt, run the following command to download the signature file for the corresponding application binary from the same S3 key prefix path:

curl -O https://awstoe-<region>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/latest/linux/<architecture>/awstoe.sig
For example:
curl -O https://awstoe-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/linux/amd64/awstoe.sig
Supported values for architecture can be amd64, 386, and arm64.

Verify the signature by running the following command at a command prompt in the directory where you saved awstoe.sig and the awstoe installation file. Both files must be present.

gpg --verify ./awstoe.sig ~/awstoe
The output should look something like the following:
gpg: Signature made Mon 20 Jul 2020 08:54:55 AM IST using RSA key ID F5AEBC52
   gpg: Good signature from "AWSTOE awstoe@amazon.com" [unknown]
   gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
   gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
   Primary key fingerprint: F6DD E01C 869F D639 15E5 5742 DEBD C156 F5AE BC52
If the output contains the phrase Good signature from "AWSTOE <awstoe@amazon.com>", it means that the signature has successfully been verified, and you can proceed to run the awstoe installation script.
If the output includes the phrase BAD signature, check whether you performed the procedure correctly. If you continue to get this response, don't run the installation file that you downloaded previously, and contact AWS Support.
The following are details about the warnings you might see: 
 WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature! There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner. This refers to your personal level of trust in your belief that you possess an authentic public key for awstoe. In an ideal world, you would visit an AWS office and receive the key in person. However, more often you download it from a website. In this case, the website is an AWS website. 
 gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found. This means that the specific key is not "ultimately trusted" by you (or by other people whom you trust).

Verify the signature of the awstoe application installation download on Windows
This topic describes the recommended process for verifying the validity of the installation file for the awstoe application on Windows-based operating systems. 
Whenever you download an application from the internet, we recommend that you authenticate the identity of the software publisher and check that the application is not altered or corrupted since it was published. This protects you from installing a version of the application that contains a virus or other malicious code.
If, after running the steps in this topic, you determine that the software for the awstoe application is altered or corrupted, do NOT run the installation file. Instead, contact AWS Support.
To verify the validity of the downloaded awstoe binary on Windows-based operating systems, make sure that the thumbprint of its Amazon Services LLC signer certificate is equal to this value:
4B AD 22 73 29 AD EF 18 F2 15 B6 47 5F B7 94 8E 16 29 B5 05
To verify this value, perform the following procedure: 


Right-click the downloaded awstoe.exe, and open the Properties window.


Choose the Digital Signatures tab.


From the Signature List, choose Amazon Services LLC, and then choose Details.


Choose the General tab, if not already selected, and then choose View Certificate.


Choose the Details tab, and then choose All in the Show dropdown list, if not already selected.


Scroll down until you see the Thumbprint field and then choose Thumbprint. This displays the entire thumbprint value in the lower window.
    If the thumbprint value in the lower window is identical to the following value:
4B AD 22 73 29 AD EF 18 F2 15 B6 47 5F B7 94 8E 16 29 B5 05
then your downloaded awstoe binary is authentic and can be safely installed.
    If the thumbprint value in the lower details window is not identical to the value above, do not run awstoe.exe.
