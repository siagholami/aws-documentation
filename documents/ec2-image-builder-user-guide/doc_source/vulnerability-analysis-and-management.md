# Patch Management in EC2 Image Builder<a name="vulnerability-analysis-and-management"></a>

EC2 Image Builder provides the latest Amazon Linux 2 and Windows 2012 R2 and later AMIs as managed image sources\. These images are regularly patched \(outside of the Image Builder service\)\. You maintain the Amazon EC2 system patching responsibility, per the [shared responsibility model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)\. If the Amazon EC2 instances in your application workload can be easily replaced, then it may be more efficient to update the base AMI and redeploy all compute nodes based on this image\.
