# Job Queues<a name="job_queues"></a>

Jobs are submitted to a job queue, where they reside until they are able to be scheduled to run in a compute environment\. An AWS account can have multiple job queues\. For example, you might create a queue that uses Amazon EC2 On\-Demand instances for high priority jobs and another queue that uses Amazon EC2 Spot Instances for low\-priority jobs\. Job queues have a priority that is used by the scheduler to determine which jobs in which queue should be evaluated for execution first\.
