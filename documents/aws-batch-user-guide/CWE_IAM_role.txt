CloudWatch Events IAM Role
Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near-real time stream of system events that describe changes in Amazon Web Services resources. AWS Batch jobs are available as CloudWatch Events targets. Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and submit AWS Batch jobs in response to them. Before you can submit AWS Batch jobs with CloudWatch Events rules and targets, CloudWatch Events must have permissions to run AWS Batch jobs on your behalf.
Note
When you create a rule in the CloudWatch Events console that specifies an AWS Batch queue as a target, you are provided with an opportunity to create this role. For an example walkthrough, see AWS Batch Jobs as CloudWatch Events Targets.
The trust relationship for your CloudWatch Events IAM role must provide the events.amazonaws.com service principal the ability to assume the role, as shown below.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "events.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
The policy attached to your CloudWatch Events IAM role should allow batch:SubmitJob permissions on your resources. AWS Batch provides the AWSBatchServiceEventTargetRole managed policy to provide these permissions, which are shown below.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "batch:SubmitJob"
       ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
