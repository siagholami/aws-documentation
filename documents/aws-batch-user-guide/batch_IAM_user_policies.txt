Creating AWS Batch IAM Policies
You can create specific IAM policies to restrict the calls and resources that users in your account have access to, and then attach those policies to IAM users.
When you attach a policy to a user or group of users, it allows or denies the users permission to perform the specified tasks on the specified resources. For more information, see Permissions and Policies in the IAM User Guide. For more information about managing and creating custom IAM policies, see Managing IAM Policies.
