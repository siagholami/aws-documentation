Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet Role
If you create a managed compute environment that uses Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet Instances, you must create a role that grants the Spot Fleet permission to launch, tag, and terminate instances on your behalf. Specify the role in your Spot Fleet request. You must also have the AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot and AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet service-linked roles for Amazon EC2 Spot and Spot Fleet. Use the procedures below to create all of these roles. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles and Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an AWS Service in the IAM User Guide.

Note
Historically, there have been two managed policies for the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role.
AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole: This was the original managed policy for the Spot Fleet role. It has tighter IAM permissions, but it does not support Spot Instance tagging in compute environments. If you've previously created a Spot Fleet role with this policy, see Spot Instances Not Tagged on Creation to apply the new recommended policy to that role.
AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole: This role provides all of the necessary permissions to tag Amazon EC2 Spot Instances. Use this role to allow Spot Instance tagging on your AWS Batch compute environments.
