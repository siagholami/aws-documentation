AWS Batch Events
AWS Batch sends job status change events to CloudWatch Events. AWS Batch tracks the state of your jobs. If a previously submitted job's status changes, an event is triggered, for example, if a job in the RUNNING status moves to the FAILED status. These events are classified as job state change events.
Note
AWS Batch may add other event types, sources, and details in the future. If you are programmatically deserializing event JSON data, make sure that your application is prepared to handle unknown properties to avoid issues if and when these additional properties are added.
Job State Change Events
Any time that an existing (previously submitted) job changes states, an event is created. For more information about AWS Batch job states, see Job States.
Note
Events are not created for the initial job submission.
Example Job State Change Event
Job state change events are delivered in the following format (the detail section below resembles the Job object that is returned from a DescribeJobs API operation in the AWS Batch API Reference). For more information about CloudWatch Events parameters, see Events and Event Patterns in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide.
