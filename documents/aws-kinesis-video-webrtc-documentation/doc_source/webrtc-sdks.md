Each SDK includes corresponding samples and step\-by\-step instructions that can help you build and run those applications\. You can use these samples for low latency, live, two\-way audio and video streaming and data exchange between any combinations of Web/Android/iOS applications or embedded devices\. In other words, you can stream live audio and video from an embedded camera device to Android or web applications or between two Android applications\.
