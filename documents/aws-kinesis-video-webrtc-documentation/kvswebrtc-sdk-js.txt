WebRTC SDK in JavaScript for Web Applications
You can find the Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC SDK in JavaScript for web applications and its corresponding samples at https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-js.
Installing the WebRTC SDK in JavaScript
To use the SDK in the browser, add the following script tag to your HTML pages:
<script src="https://unpkg.com/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc/dist/kvs-webrtc.min.js"></script>
The SDK classes are made available in the global window under the KVSWebRTC namespace. For example, window.KVSWebRTC.SignalingClient.
The SDK is also compatible with bundlers like Webpack. Complete these steps to install the NodeJS module version.
To install the NodeJS module version

The preferred way to install the SDK for NodeJS is to use the npm package manager. Run the following command:

npm install amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc

The SDK classes can then be imported like typical NodeJS modules:

```
   // JavaScript
   const SignalingClient = require('amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc').SignalingClient;
// TypeScript
   import { SignalingClient } from 'amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc';
   ```
Using the Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC Test Page
The https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-js GitHub repo hosts a Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC test page that you can use to create a new or connect to an existing signaling channel and use it as a master or viewer.
The Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC test page is located at https://awslabs.github.io/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-js/examples/index.html.


Open the Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC test page and specify the following information that you want to use for this demo:
    AWS Region
    The access key and the secret key of the AWS account that you want to use for this demo.
    The name of the signaling channel to which you want to connect.
    Whether you want to send audio, video, or both.


If it's a new signaling channel, first choose Create Channel. If it's an existing signaling channel, choose either Start Master or Start Viewer to connect to this channel either as a master or as a viewer.


From there, refer to the example usage in the examples directory for how to write an end-to-end WebRTC application that uses the SDK.
Run the WebRTC Test Page Locally
The SDK and test page can be edited and run locally by following these instructions. NodeJS version 8 is required.

Download the WebRTC SDK in JavaScript by running the following command:

git clone https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-js.git


Run npm install to download dependencies.


Run npm run develop to run the webserver.


You have to provide an AWS region, AWS credentials, and a Channel Name to use the WebRTC test page.
The source code for the test page is in the examples directory.
