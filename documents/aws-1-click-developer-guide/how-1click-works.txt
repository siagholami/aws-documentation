How AWS IoT 1-Click Works
Here is the AWS IoT 1-Click workflow:


Choose from a set of supported devices.


Associate AWS Lambda functions with devices to trigger actions. You can use one of your own Lambda functions or one of the predefined functions provided by the service.


Physically deploy your devices and use the AWS IoT 1-Click console, AWS IoT 1-Click mobile app, or AWS IoT 1-Click API to enable them.


Get information about device status and usage by using ready-made AWS IoT 1-Click reports or building your own.
