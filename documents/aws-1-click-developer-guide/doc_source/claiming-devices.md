# Claiming Devices<a name="claiming-devices"></a>

The following procedure shows you how to claim one or more AWS IoT 1\-Click supported devices\.

1. Sign in to your AWS account\. If you do not have an AWS account, open [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/), choose **Create an AWS Account**, and follow the online instructions\.

1. From the AWS Management Console, search for "1\-Click," and then choose AWS IoT 1\-Click\.

1. If you're using one or more AWS IoT Enterprise Buttons, install the AWS IoT 1\-Click mobile app for iOS or Android and connect the buttons to your local Wi\-Fi network\. The AWS IoT 1\-Click mobile app is available from the **Onboard** page of the AWS IoT 1\-Click console\. This step is not required for the LTE\-M Button because it uses the cellular network\.

1. Choose **Onboard**, and then choose **Claim devices**\.

1. Enter one or more [device IDs](what-is-1click.md#1click-glossary) \(such as a device serial number\) or [claim codes](what-is-1click.md#1click-glossary), separated by commas, and then choose **Claim**\. If the **Claim** button is unavailable, double\-check all the values you entered\.

1. Press the button\(s\) on your device\(s\), and then choose **Done**\. A list of all known devices should be displayed\.
