# Claiming Devices<a name="1click-claiming"></a>

When AWS IoT 1\-Click devices leave the factory, they are not associated with an AWS customer account\. Customers must go through a claim process to use the devices in their accounts\. There are two ways to claim devices:
+ **Using a claim code**: If you receive a claim code \(in the format C\-*xxxxx*\) from your point of purchase, you can enter it into the AWS IoT 1\-Click console or the AWS IoT 1\-Click mobile app to claim devices pertaining to a single order\. Not all devices, including the AWS IoT Enterprise Button, can be claimed using a claim code\.
+ **Using a device ID**: You can use the device ID \(the device serial number, also known as the DSN\) to claim devices through the AWS IoT 1\-Click console or the AWS IoT 1\-Click mobile app\. All AWS IoT 1\-Click devices can be claimed using a device ID\.

For more information about how to claim devices, see [AWS IoT 1\-Click Appendix](1click-appendix.md) and [Claiming Devices](claiming-devices.md)\.
