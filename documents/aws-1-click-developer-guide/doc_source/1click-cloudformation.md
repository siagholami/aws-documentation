# AWS CloudFormation Integration<a name="1click-cloudformation"></a>

AWS IoT 1\-Click is integrated with AWS CloudFormation, a common language for you to describe and provision all your infrastructure resources in a cloud environment \(i\.e\., Amazon EC2, Auto Scaling, Amazon SNS, etc\.\) AWS CloudFormation allows you to use a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts\. This file serves as the single source of truth for your cloud environment\. For more information, see the [AWS CloudFormation User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/) as well as the AWS IoT 1\-Click topics \(such as [AWS::IoT1Click::Project](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iot1click-project.html)\) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*\.
