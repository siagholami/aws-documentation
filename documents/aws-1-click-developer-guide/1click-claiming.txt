Claiming Devices
When AWS IoT 1-Click devices leave the factory, they are not associated with an AWS customer account. Customers must go through a claim process to use the devices in their accounts. There are two ways to claim devices:
 Using a claim code: If you receive a claim code (in the format C-xxxxx) from your point of purchase, you can enter it into the AWS IoT 1-Click console or the AWS IoT 1-Click mobile app to claim devices pertaining to a single order. Not all devices, including the AWS IoT Enterprise Button, can be claimed using a claim code.
 Using a device ID: You can use the device ID (the device serial number, also known as the DSN) to claim devices through the AWS IoT 1-Click console or the AWS IoT 1-Click mobile app. All AWS IoT 1-Click devices can be claimed using a device ID.
