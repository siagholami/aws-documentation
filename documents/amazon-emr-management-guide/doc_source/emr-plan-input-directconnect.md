# Connect to Data with AWS DirectConnect<a name="emr-plan-input-directconnect"></a>

AWS Direct Connect is a service you can use to establish a private dedicated network connection to AWS from your datacenter, office, or colocation environment\. If you have large amounts of input data, using AWS Direct Connect may reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet\-based connections\. For more information see the [AWS Direct Connect User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/)\.
