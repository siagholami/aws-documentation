# Customize Proxy Agent Certificate<a name="emr-lf-TLS"></a>

The proxy agent uses a self\-signed Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) certificate by default\. To use a custom certificate for the proxy agent, you must first obtain a certificate, certificate chain, and private key from your certificate authority\. With those items, a PKCS12 file will be used to protect the key material so it can be imported into the proxy agentâ€™s key store\. The proxy agent is based on Apache Knox\. You can replace the default certificate with your custom certificate using the following steps\. 

In the following steps, replace *MasterPublicDNS* with the value that appears for **Master public DNS** on the **Summary** tab of the **cluster details** pane\. For example, *ec2\-11\-222\-33\-44\.compute\-1\.amazonaws\.com*\.

1. To create a PKCS12 file from your certificate, certificate chain, and private key, run the following command on a host with the certificate files, and `openssl` installed\.

   ```
   openssl pkcs12 -export -out proxy_agent_certificate.pfx -inkey private.key -in certificate.cer -certfile certchain.cer
   ```

1. Copy the `proxy_agent_certificate.pfx` file to the `/home/hadoop` directory on the master node of your cluster\.

   ```
   scp -i EC2KeyPair.pem proxy_agent_certificate.pfx hadoop@MasterPublicDNS:/home/hadoop
   ```

1. SSH into the master node of your cluster\.

   ```
   ssh -i EC2KeyPair.pem hadoop@MasterPublicDNS
   ```

1. Find your cluster\-specific master key by using the following command\.

   ```
   less /etc/knox/conf/gateway-site.xml
   ```

   Look for the *gateway\.master\.secret* property and copy the contents of the `value` tag, as you will need it for future steps\.

1. Create a backup copy of the existing proxy agent keystores by using the following commands\.

   ```
   sudo -s
   cd /mnt/var/lib/knox/data/security/keystores
   mkdir backups
   mv gateway.jks __gateway-credentials.jceks backups/
   ```

1. Import your custom certificates into a new keystore by using the following commands\.

   ```
   sudo -s
   cd /mnt/var/lib/knox/data/security/keystores
   keytool -importkeystore \
   -srckeystore /home/hadoop/proxy_agent_certificate.pfx \
   -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore gateway.jks \
   -deststoretype jks \
   -srcalias 1 \
   -destalias gateway-identity
   ```

   When prompted for the `Enter destination keystore password`, use the Knox master secret from the `gateway-site.xml` file\.

   Ensure the newly created `gateway.jks` file is owned by the knox user by using the following command\.

   ```
   chown knox:knox gateway.jks
   ```

   If your private key is protected by a password, make sure Knox is aware of that password\.

   ```
   sudo -u knox bash
   cd /usr/lib/knox
   bin/knoxcli.sh create-cert create-alias gateway-identity-passphrase
   ```

   Enter the password protecting your private key when prompted\.

1. Restart Knox by using the following commands\.

   ```
   sudo -u knox bash
   cd /usr/lib/knox
   bin/gateway.sh stop
   ```

   Knox should be restarted automatically, and you can check the status of Knox by viewing the `/var/log/knox/gateway.log`\.

1. To ensure the new certificate is being used by the proxy agent, navigate to Apache Zeppelin https://*MasterPublicDNS*:8442/gateway/default/zeppelin/\. You can use your browser to inspect the certificate to ensure it is your custom certificate\.
