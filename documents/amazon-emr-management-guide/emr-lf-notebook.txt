Using Notebooks with Lake Formation
Both Apache Zeppelin and EMR Notebooks are integrated with Lake Formation, and can be used once an EMR cluster integrated with Lake Formation has been created. 
In order to access both notebook applications, you must first ensure that your cluster’s EC2 security group or VPC network access control list (ACL) is configured to allow access to the Proxy Agent (port 8442) from your desktop.
Note
The Proxy Agent on the EMR cluster uses a self-signed Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate by default, and your browser will prompt you to accept the certificate before proceeding. If you want to use a custom certificate for the Proxy Agent, see the “Customize Proxy Agent Certificate” section.
Apache Zeppelin
To access Apache Zeppelin, use the EMR console to locate the Master public DNS from the cluster’s Summary tab. Using your browser, navigate to https://MasterPublicDNS:8442/gateway/default/zeppelin/. Ensure the URL includes the trailing slash at the end. 
Once the Proxy Agent’s certificate is accepted, your browser redirects you to your Identity Provider (IdP) to authenticate. Once authenticated, you will be redirected to Zeppelin. 
Creating your first Zeppelin Notebook
To get started, create a new Notebook by selecting Notebook, Create new note. Give your Notebook a name and use the default livy interpreter.
To see a list of Lake Formation databases, use the following Spark SQL command.
spark.sql("show databases").show()
To query a specific Lake Formation table, use the following Spark SQL command. Replace database.table with actual databases and tables in Lake Formation:
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM database.table limit 10").show()
EMR Notebooks
EMR notebooks can be created using the Amazon EMR console and used with an existing EMR cluster integrated with Lake Formation.
To create an EMR notebook


Open the Amazon EMR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/.


Choose Notebooks, Create notebook.


Enter a Notebook name and an optional Notebook description.


Select Choose an existing cluster, and then Choose.


Select an existing EMR cluster integrated with Lake Formation.


Select Create notebook to create the notebook.


Once the Notebook has been created, select the notebook and click Open. You will be redirected to the Proxy Agent on the Amazon EMR cluster. Once you’ve accepted the Proxy Agent’s certificate, your browser will redirect you to your Identity Provider (IdP) to authenticate. Once authenticated, you will be redirected to the EMR notebook.
