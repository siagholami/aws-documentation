Adding Tags to an Existing Cluster
You can also add tags to an existing cluster.
To add tags to an existing cluster using the console


In the Amazon EMR console, select the Cluster List page and click a cluster to which to add tags.


On the Cluster Details page, in the Tags field, click View All/Edit. 


On the View All/Edit page, click Add. 


Click the empty field in the Key column and type the name of your key. 


Optionally, click the empty field in the Value column and type the name of your value. 


With each new tag you begin, another empty tag line appears under the tag you are currently editing. Repeat the previous steps on the new tag line for each tag to add. 


To add tags to a running cluster using the AWS CLI
The following example demonstrates how to add tags to a running cluster using the AWS CLI. Type the add-tags subcommand with the --tag parameter to assign tags to a resource identifier (cluster ID). The resource ID is the cluster identifier available via the console or the list-clusters command.
Note
The add-tags subcommand currently accepts only one resource ID.
 To add two tags to a running cluster (one with a key named production with no value and the other with a key named costCenter with a value of marketing) type the following command and replace j-KT4XXXXXXXX1NM with your cluster ID. 
aws emr add-tags --resource-id j-KT4XXXXXXXX1NM --tag "costCenter=marketing" --tag "other=accounting"
Note
When tags are added using the AWS CLI, there is no output from the command.
