Enhanced Step Debugging
If an Amazon EMR step fails and you submitted your work using the Step API operation with an AMI of version 5.x or later, Amazon EMR can identify and return the root cause of the step failure in some cases, along with the name of the relevant log file and a portion of the application stack trace via API. For example, the following failures can be identified: 
 A common Hadoop error such as the output directory already exists, the input directory does not exist, or an application runs out of memory.
 Java errors such as an application that was compiled with an incompatible version of Java or run with a main class that is not found.
 An issue accessing objects stored in Amazon S3.
This information is available using the DescribeStep and ListSteps API operations. The FailureDetails field of the StepSummary returned by those operations. To access the FailureDetails information, use the AWS CLI, console, or AWS SDK.
To view failure details using the AWS Console


Open the Amazon EMR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/.


Choose Cluster List and select a cluster.


Select the arrow icon next to each step to view more details.


If the step has failed and Amazon EMR can identify the root cause, you see the details of the failure.

To view failure details using the AWS CLI
 To get failure details for a step using the AWS CLI, use the describe-step command.
aws emr describe-step –cluster-id j-1K48XXXXXHCB –step-id s-3QM0XXXXXM1W
The output will look similar to the following:
