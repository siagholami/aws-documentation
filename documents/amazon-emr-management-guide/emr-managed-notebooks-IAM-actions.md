# IAM Policy Actions for EMR Notebooks<a name="emr-managed-notebooks-IAM-actions"></a>

The actions listed in the following table are related to EMR Notebooks\. For a user to perform an action, an IAM policy must be associated with the principal \(user\) that allows the action\. For tagging purposes, some actions are performed on clusters, notebooks, or both\. This is important for resource tagging\. For more information, see [Using Tags to Control User Permissions](emr-managed-notebooks-tags.md)\.
