# Tag Resources for Billing<a name="emr-plan-tags-billing"></a>

You can use tags for organizing your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure\. To do this, sign up to get your AWS account bill with tag key values included\. You can then organize your billing information by tag key values, to see the cost of your combined resources\. Although Amazon EMR and Amazon EC2 have different billing statements, the tags on each cluster are also placed on each associated instance so you can use tags to link related Amazon EMR and Amazon EC2 costs\.

For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services\. For more information, see [Cost Allocation and Tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2//allocation.html) in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide*\.
