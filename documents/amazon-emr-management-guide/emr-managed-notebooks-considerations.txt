If you require additional libraries that all users can access, you can install them using bootstrap actions or by specifying a custom Amazon Linux AMI for Amazon EMR when you create a cluster. For more information, see Create Bootstrap Actions to Install Additional Software and Using a Custom AMI.
With Amazon EMR 5.26.0 and later, you can install additional library packages from within the notebook editor. These libraries are notebook-scoped libraries. They are available only to the current notebook session. They do not interfere with cluster-wide libraries or libraries installed within other notebooks. For more information, see Using Notebook-Scoped Libraries.
Clusters that you use with an EMR notebook have requirements. The number of notebooks that you can use with a cluster is limited by the master node configuration. For more information, see Creating Amazon EMR Clusters for Notebooks.
