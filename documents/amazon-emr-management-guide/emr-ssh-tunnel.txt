Option 2, Part 1: Set Up an SSH Tunnel to the Master Node Using Dynamic Port Forwarding
To connect to the local web server on the master node, you create an SSH tunnel between your computer and the master node. This is also known as port forwarding. If you create your SSH tunnel using dynamic port forwarding, all traffic routed to a specified unused local port is forwarded to the local web server on the master node. This creates a SOCKS proxy. You can then configure your Internet browser to use an add-on such as FoxyProxy or SwitchySharp to manage your SOCKS proxy settings. Using a proxy management add-on allows you to automatically filter URLs based on text patterns and to limit the proxy settings to domains that match the form of the master node's public DNS name. The browser add-on automatically handles turning the proxy on and off when you switch between viewing websites hosted on the master node, and those on the Internet. 
Before you begin, you need the public DNS name of the master node and your key pair private key file. For information about how to locate the master public DNS name, see To retrieve the public DNS name of the master node using the Amazon EMR console. For more information about accessing your key pair, see Amazon EC2 Key Pairs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. For more information about the sites you might want to view on the master node, see View Web Interfaces Hosted on Amazon EMR Clusters.
Set Up an SSH Tunnel to the Master Node Using Dynamic Port Forwarding on Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X
To set up an SSH tunnel using dynamic port forwarding on Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X


Open a terminal window. On Mac OS X, choose Applications > Utilities > Terminal. On other Linux distributions, terminal is typically found at Applications > Accessories > Terminal.


Type the following command to open an SSH tunnel on your local machine. Replace \~/mykeypair.pem with the location and file name of your .pem file, replace 8157 with an unused, local port number, and replace c2-###-##-##-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com with the master public DNS name of your cluster. 


1. ssh -i ~/mykeypair.pem -N -D 8157 hadoop@ec2-###-##-##-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com
After you issue this command, the terminal remains open and does not return a response. 
Note
-D signifies the use of dynamic port forwarding which allows you to specify a local port used to forward data to all remote ports on the master node's local web server. Dynamic port forwarding creates a local SOCKS proxy listening on the port specified in the command.


After the tunnel is active, configure a SOCKS proxy for your browser. For more information, see Option 2, Part 2: Configure Proxy Settings to View Websites Hosted on the Master Node.


When you are done working with the web interfaces on the master node, close the terminal window.


Set Up an SSH tunnel Using Dynamic Port Forwarding with the AWS CLI
You can create an SSH connection with the master node using the AWS CLI on Windows and on Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X. If you are using the AWS CLI on Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X, you must set permissions on the .pem file as shown in To configure the key pair private key file permissions. If you are using the AWS CLI on Windows, PuTTY must appear in the path environment variable or you may receive an error such as OpenSSH or PuTTY not available.
To set up an SSH tunnel using dynamic port forwarding with the AWS CLI


Create an SSH connection with the master node as shown in Connect to the Master Node Using the AWS CLI. 


To retrieve the cluster identifier, type:


1. aws emr list-clusters
The output lists your clusters including the cluster IDs. Note the cluster ID for the cluster to which you are connecting.
"Status": {
       "Timeline": {
           "ReadyDateTime": 1408040782.374,
           "CreationDateTime": 1408040501.213
       },
       "State": "WAITING",
       "StateChangeReason": {
           "Message": "Waiting after step completed"
       }
   },
   "NormalizedInstanceHours": 4,
   "Id": "j-2AL4XXXXXX5T9",
   "Name": "AWS CLI cluster"

Type the following command to open an SSH tunnel to the master node using dynamic port forwarding. In the following example, replace j-2AL4XXXXXX5T9 with the cluster ID and replace \~/mykeypair.key with the location and file name of your .pem file (for Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X) or .ppk file (for Windows).

aws emr socks --cluster-id j-2AL4XXXXXX5T9 --key-pair-file ~/mykeypair.key
Note
The socks command automatically configures dynamic port forwarding on local port 8157. Currently, this setting cannot be modified.


After the tunnel is active, configure a SOCKS proxy for your browser. For more information, see Option 2, Part 2: Configure Proxy Settings to View Websites Hosted on the Master Node.


When you are done working with the web interfaces on the master node, close the AWS CLI window. 


For more information on using Amazon EMR commands in the AWS CLI, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr.
Set Up an SSH Tunnel to the Master Node Using Dynamic Port Forwarding on Windows
Windows users can use an SSH client such as PuTTY to create an SSH tunnel to the master node. Before connecting to the Amazon EMR master node, you should download and install PuTTY and PuTTYgen. You can download these tools from the PuTTY download page.
PuTTY does not natively support the key pair private key file format (.pem) generated by Amazon EC2. You use PuTTYgen to convert your key file to the required PuTTY format (.ppk). You must convert your key into this format (.ppk) before attempting to connect to the master node using PuTTY.
For more information about converting your key, see Converting Your Private Key Using PuTTYgen in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
To set up an SSH tunnel using dynamic port forwarding on Windows


Double-click putty.exe to start PuTTY. You can also launch PuTTY from the Windows programs list. 
Note
If you already have an active SSH session with the master node, you can add a tunnel by right-clicking the PuTTY title bar and choosing Change Settings. 


If necessary, in the Category list, choose Session.


In the Host Name* field, type **hadoop@MasterPublicDNS. For example: hadoop@*ec2-###-##-##-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com. 


In the Category list, expand Connection > SSH, and then choose Auth.


For Private key file for authentication, choose Browse and select the .ppk file that you generated. 
Note
PuTTY does not natively support the key pair private key file format (.pem) generated by Amazon EC2. You use PuTTYgen to convert your key file to the required PuTTY format (.ppk). You must convert your key into this format (.ppk) before attempting to connect to the master node using PuTTY.


In the Category list, expand Connection > SSH, and then choose Tunnels. 


In the Source port field, type 8157 (an unused local port).


Leave the Destination field blank.


Select the Dynamic and Auto options.


Choose Add and Open. 


Choose Yes to dismiss the PuTTY security alert.
Important
When you log in to the master node, type hadoop if you are prompted for a user name.


After the tunnel is active, configure a SOCKS proxy for your browser. For more information, see Option 2, Part 2: Configure Proxy Settings to View Websites Hosted on the Master Node.


When you are done working with the web interfaces on the master node, close the PuTTY window.
