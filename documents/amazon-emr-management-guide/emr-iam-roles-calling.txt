Use IAM Roles with Applications That Call AWS Services Directly
Applications running on the EC2 instances of a cluster can use the EC2 instance profile to obtain temporary security credentials when calling AWS services.
The versions of Hadoop available with Amazon EMR release 2.3.0 and later have already been updated to make use of IAM roles. If your application runs strictly on top of the Hadoop architecture, and does not directly call any service in AWS, it should work with IAM roles with no modification.
If your application calls services in AWS directly, you need to update it to take advantage of IAM roles. This means that instead of obtaining account credentials from /etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml on the EC2 instances in the cluster, your application uses an SDK to access the resources using IAM roles, or calls the EC2 instance metadata to obtain the temporary credentials.
To access AWS resources with IAM roles using an SDK
 The following topics show how to use several of the AWS SDKs to access temporary credentials using IAM roles. Each topic starts with a version of an application that does not use IAM roles and then walks you through the process of converting that application to use IAM roles.

To obtain temporary credentials from EC2 instance metadata
 Call the following URL from an EC2 instance that is running with the specified IAM role, which returns the associated temporary security credentials (AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey, SessionToken, and Expiration). The following example uses the default instance profile for Amazon EMR, EMR_EC2_DefaultRole. 
GET http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/EMR_EC2_DefaultRole
