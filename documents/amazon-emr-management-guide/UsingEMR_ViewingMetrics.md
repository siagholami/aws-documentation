# Monitor Metrics with CloudWatch<a name="UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics"></a>

 Metrics are updated every five minutes and automatically collected and pushed to CloudWatch for every EMR cluster\. This interval is not configurable\. There is no charge for the Amazon EMR metrics reported in CloudWatch\. Metrics are archived for two weeks, after which the data is discarded\. 

## How Do I Use Amazon EMR Metrics?<a name="UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics_HowDoI"></a>

 The metrics reported by Amazon EMR provide information that you can analyze in different ways\. The table below shows some common uses for the metrics\. These are suggestions to get you started, not a comprehensive list\. For the complete list of metrics reported by Amazon EMR, see [Metrics Reported by Amazon EMR in CloudWatch](#UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics_MetricsReported)\. 


****  

| How do I? | Relevant Metrics | 
| --- | --- | 
| Track the progress of my cluster |  Look at the RunningMapTasks, RemainingMapTasks, RunningReduceTasks, and RemainingReduceTasks metrics\.  | 
| Detect clusters that are idle |  The IsIdle metric tracks whether a cluster is live, but not currently running tasks\. You can set an alarm to fire when the cluster has been idle for a given period of time, such as thirty minutes\.  | 
| Detect when a node runs out of storage |  The HDFSUtilization metric is the percentage of disk space currently used\. If this rises above an acceptable level for your application, such as 80% of capacity used, you may need to resize your cluster and add more core nodes\.  | 

## Accessing CloudWatch Metrics<a name="UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics_Access"></a>

 There are many ways to access the metrics that Amazon EMR pushes to CloudWatch\. You can view them through either the Amazon EMR console or CloudWatch console, or you can retrieve them using the CloudWatch CLI or the CloudWatch API\. The following procedures show you how to access the metrics using these various tools\. 

**To view metrics in the Amazon EMR console**

1. Open the Amazon EMR console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/elasticmapreduce/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/)\.

1.  To view metrics for a cluster, select a cluster to display the **Summary** pane\. 

1.  Choose **Monitoring** to view information about that cluster\. Choose any one of the tabs named **Cluster Status**, **Map/Reduce**, **Node Status**, **IO**, or **HBase** to load the reports about the progress and health of the cluster\. 

1.  After you choose a metric to view, you can select a graph size\. Edit **Start** and **End** fields to filter the metrics to a specific time frame\.

**To view metrics in the CloudWatch console**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1.  In the navigation pane, choose **EMR**\. 

1.  Scroll down to the metric to graph\. You can search on the cluster identifier of the cluster to monitor\.  
![\[Metrics Alarm Tutorial\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/images/cw-metrics-2.png)

1.  Open a metric to display the graph\.  
![\[Metrics Alarm Tutorial\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/images/cw-display-graph.png)

**To access metrics from the CloudWatch CLI**
+  Call `[mon\-get\-stats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/cli/cli-mon-get-stats.html)`\. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/)\. 

**To access metrics from the CloudWatch API**
+  Call `[GetMetricStatistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html)`\. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/)\. 

## Setting Alarms on Metrics<a name="UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics_Alarm"></a>

 Amazon EMR pushes metrics to CloudWatch, which means you can use CloudWatch to set alarms on your Amazon EMR metrics\. You can, for example, configure an alarm in CloudWatch to send you an email any time the HDFS utilization rises above 80%\. 

 The following topics give you a high\-level overview of how to set alarms using CloudWatch\. For detailed instructions, see [Create or Edit a CloudWatch Alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ConsoleAlarms.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\. 

**Set alarms using the CloudWatch console**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1.  Choose **Create Alarm**\. This launches the **Create Alarm Wizard**\. 

1. Choose **EMR Metrics** and scroll through the Amazon EMR metrics to locate the metric you want to place an alarm on\. An easy way to display just the Amazon EMR metrics in this dialog box is to search on the cluster identifier of your cluster\. Select the metric to create an alarm on and choose **Next**\. 

1.  Fill in the **Name**, **Description**, **Threshold**, and **Time** values for the metric\. 

1. If you want CloudWatch to send you an email when the alarm state is reached, in the **Whenever this alarm:** field, choose **State is ALARM**\. For **Send notification to:**, select an existing SNS topic\. If you choose **Create topic**, you can set the name and email addresses for a new email subscription list\. This list is saved and appears in the field for future alarms\. 
**Note**  
 If you use **Create topic** to create a new Amazon SNS topic, the email addresses must be verified before they receive notifications\. Emails are only sent when the alarm enters an alarm state\. If this alarm state change happens before the email addresses are verified, they do not receive a notification\. 

1.  At this point, the **Define Alarm** screen gives you a chance to review the alarm that youâ€™re about to create\. Choose **Create Alarm**\. 

**Note**  
 For more information about how to set alarms using the CloudWatch console, see [Create an Alarm that Sends Email](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\. 

**To set an alarm using the CloudWatch API**
+  Call `[mon\-put\-metric\-alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/cli/cli-mon-put-metric-alarm.html)`\. For more information, see *[Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/)*\. 

**To set an alarm using the CloudWatch API**
+  Call `[PutMetricAlarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutMetricAlarm.html)`\. For more information, see *[Amazon CloudWatch API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/)* 

## Metrics Reported by Amazon EMR in CloudWatch<a name="UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics_MetricsReported"></a>

The following tables list the metrics that Amazon EMR reports in the console and pushes to CloudWatch\.

### Amazon EMR Metrics<a name="emr-metrics-reported"></a>

 Amazon EMR sends data for several metrics to CloudWatch\. All Amazon EMR clusters automatically send metrics in five\-minute intervals\. Metrics are archived for two weeks; after that period, the data is discarded\. 

The `AWS/ElasticMapReduce` namespace includes the following metrics\.

**Note**  
Amazon EMR pulls metrics from a cluster\. If a cluster becomes unreachable, no metrics are reported until the cluster becomes available again\.

The following metrics are available for clusters running Hadoop 2\.x versions\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Cluster Status | 
|  IsIdle  |  Indicates that a cluster is no longer performing work, but is still alive and accruing charges\. It is set to 1 if no tasks are running and no jobs are running, and set to 0 otherwise\. This value is checked at five\-minute intervals and a value of 1 indicates only that the cluster was idle when checked, not that it was idle for the entire five minutes\. To avoid false positives, you should raise an alarm when this value has been 1 for more than one consecutive 5\-minute check\. For example, you might raise an alarm on this value if it has been 1 for thirty minutes or longer\. Use case: Monitor cluster performance Units: *Boolean*  |

 Amazon EMR data can be filtered using any of the dimensions in the following table\. 


| Dimension  | Description  | 
| --- | --- | 
| JobFlowId |  The same as cluster ID, which is the unique identifier of a cluster in the form j\-XXXXXXXXXXXXX\. Find this value by clicking on the cluster in the Amazon EMR console\.  | 
| JobId |  The identifier of a job within a cluster\. You can use this to filter the metrics returned from a cluster down to those that apply to a single job within the cluster\. JobId takes the form job\_XXXXXXXXXXXX\_XXXX\.  |
