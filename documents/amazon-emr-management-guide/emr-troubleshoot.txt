When you are developing a new Hadoop application, we recommend that you enable debugging and process a small but representative subset of your data to test the application. You may also want to run the application step-by-step to test each step separately. For more information, see Configure Cluster Logging and Debugging and Step 5: Test the Cluster Step by Step.
