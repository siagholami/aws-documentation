Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit
Data encryption helps prevent unauthorized users from reading data on a cluster and associated data storage systems. This includes data saved to persistent media, known as data at rest, and data that may be intercepted as it travels the network, known as data in transit.
Beginning with Amazon EMR version 4.8.0, you can use Amazon EMR security configurations to configure data encryption settings for clusters more easily. Security configurations offer settings to enable security for data in-transit and data at-rest in Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes and EMRFS on Amazon S3. 
Optionally, beginning with Amazon EMR release version 4.1.0 and later, you can choose to configure transparent encryption in HDFS, which is not configured using security configurations. For more information, see Transparent Encryption in HDFS on Amazon EMR in the Amazon EMR Release Guide.
