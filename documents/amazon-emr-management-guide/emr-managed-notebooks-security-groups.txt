Specifying EC2 Security Groups for EMR Notebooks
When you create an EMR notebook, two security groups are used to control network traffic between the EMR notebook and the Amazon EMR cluster when the notebook editor is used. The default security groups have minimal rules that allow only network traffic between the EMR Notebooks service and the clusters to which notebooks are attached.
An EMR notebook uses Apache Livy to communicate with the cluster via a proxy using TCP Port 18888. By creating custom security groups with rules tailored to your environment, you can limit network traffic so that only a subset of notebooks can run code within the notebook editor on particular clusters. The security groups are used in addition to the security groups for the cluster. For more information, see Control Network Traffic with Security Groups in the Amazon EMR Management Guide and Specifying EC2 Security Groups for EMR Notebooks.
Default EC2 Security Group for the Master Instance
The default EC2 security group for the master instance is associated with the master instance in addition to the cluster's security groups for the master instance.
Group Name: ElasticMapReduceEditors-Livy
Rules
 Inbound
Allow TCP Port 18888 from any resources in the default EC2 security group for EMR Notebooks
 Outbound
None
Default EC2 Security Group for EMR Notebooks
The default EC2 security group for the EMR notebook is associated with the notebook editor for any EMR notebook to which it is assigned.
Group Name: ElasticMapReduceEditors-Editor
Rules
 Inbound
None
 Outbound
Allow TCP Port 18888 to any resources in the default EC2 security group for EMR Notebooks.
Custom EC2 Security Group for EMR Notebooks When Associating Notebooks with Git Repositories
To link a Git repository to your notebook, the security group for the EMR notebook must include an outbound rule to allow the notebook to route traffic to the internet. It is recommended that you create a new security group for this purpose. Updating the default ElasticMapReduceEditors-Editor security group may give the same outbound rules to other notebooks that are attached to this security group. 
Rules
 Inbound
None
 Outbound
Allow the notebook to route traffic to the internet via the cluster, as the following example demonstrates:
