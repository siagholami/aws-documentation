Option 1: Set Up an SSH Tunnel to the Master Node Using Local Port Forwarding
To connect to the local web server on the master node, you create an SSH tunnel between your computer and the master node. This is also known as port forwarding. If you do not wish to use a SOCKS proxy, you can set up an SSH tunnel to the master node using local port forwarding. With local port forwarding, you specify unused local ports that are used to forward traffic to specific remote ports on the master node's local web server. 
Setting up an SSH tunnel using local port forwarding requires the public DNS name of the master node and your key pair private key file. For information about how to locate the master public DNS name, see To retrieve the public DNS name of the master node using the Amazon EMR console. For more information about accessing your key pair, see Amazon EC2 Key Pairs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. For more information about the sites you might want to view on the master node, see View Web Interfaces Hosted on Amazon EMR Clusters.
Set Up an SSH Tunnel to the Master Node Using Local Port Forwarding on Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X
To set up an SSH tunnel using local port forwarding in terminal


Open a terminal window. On Mac OS X, choose Applications > Utilities > Terminal. On other Linux distributions, terminal is typically found at Applications > Accessories > Terminal.


Type the following command to open an SSH tunnel on your local machine. This command accesses the ResourceManager web interface by forwarding traffic on local port 8157 (a randomly chosen, unused local port) to port 8088 on the master node's local web server. In the command, replace \~/mykeypair.pem with the location and file name of your .pem file and replace ec2-###-##-##-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com with the master public DNS name of your cluster. 


1. ssh -i ~/mykeypair.pem -N -L 8157:ec2-###-##-##-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8088 hadoop@ec2-###-##-##-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com
After you issue this command, the terminal remains open and does not return a response. 
Note
-L signifies the use of local port forwarding which allows you to specify a local port used to forward data to the identified remote port on the master node's local web server.


To open the ResourceManager web interface in your browser, type: http://localhost:8157/ in the address bar. 


When you are done working with the web interfaces on the master node, close the terminal windows.
