Plan and Configure Clusters
This section explains configuration options and instructions for planning, configuring, and launching clusters using Amazon EMR. Before you launch a cluster, you make choices about your system based on the data that you're processing and your requirements for cost, speed, capacity, availability, security, and manageability. Your choices include: 
 What region to run a cluster in, where and how to store data, and how to output results. See Configure Cluster Location and Data Storage.
 Whether you are running Amazon EMR clusters on Outposts. See EMR Clusters on AWS Outposts.
 Whether a cluster is long-running or transient, and what software it runs. See Configuring a Cluster to Auto-Terminate or Continue and Configure Cluster Software.
 Whether a cluster has a single master node or three master nodes. See Plan and Configure Master Nodes.
 The hardware and networking options that optimize cost, performance, and availability for your application. See Configure Cluster Hardware and Networking.
 How to set up clusters so you can manage them more easily, and monitor activity, performance, and health. See Configure Cluster Logging and Debugging and Tag Clusters.
 How to authenticate and authorize access to cluster resources, and how to encrypt data. See Security in Amazon EMR.
 How to integrate with other software and services. See Drivers and Third-Party Application Integration.
