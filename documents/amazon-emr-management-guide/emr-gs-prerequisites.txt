Step 1: Set Up Prerequisites for Your Sample Cluster
Before you begin setting up your Amazon EMR cluster, make sure that you complete the prerequisites in this topic. 
Sign Up for AWS
If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one.
To sign up for an AWS account


Open https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.


Follow the online instructions.


Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.
Create an Amazon S3 Bucket
In this tutorial, you specify an Amazon S3 bucket and folder to store the output data from a Hive query. The tutorial uses the default log location, but you can also specify a custom location if you prefer. Because of Hadoop requirements, bucket and folder names that you use with Amazon EMR have the following limitations:
 They must contain only letters, numbers, periods (.), and hyphens (-).
 They cannot end in numbers.
If you already have access to a folder that meets these requirements, you can use it for this tutorial. The output folder should be empty. Another requirement to remember is that bucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts. 
For more information about creating a bucket, see Create a Bucket in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Getting Started Guide. After you create the bucket, choose it from the list and then choose Create folder, replace New folder with a name that meets the requirements, and then choose Save.
The bucket and folder name used later in the tutorial is s3://mybucket/MyHiveQueryResults.
Create an Amazon EC2 Key Pair
You must have an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) key pair to connect to the nodes in your cluster over a secure channel using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. If you already have a key pair that you want to use, you can skip this step. If you don't have a key pair, follow one of the following procedures depending on your operating system.
