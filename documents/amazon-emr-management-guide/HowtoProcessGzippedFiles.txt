How to Process Compressed Files
Hadoop checks the file extension to detect compressed files. The compression types supported by Hadoop are: gzip, bzip2, and LZO. You do not need to take any additional action to extract files using these types of compression; Hadoop handles it for you.
To index LZO files, you can use the hadoop-lzo library which can be downloaded from https://github.com/kevinweil/hadoop-lzo. Note that because this is a third-party library, Amazon EMR does not offer developer support on how to use this tool. For usage information, see the hadoop-lzo readme file.
