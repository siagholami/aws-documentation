    :description: Using the AWS SDK for Ruby with Ruby on Rails

`Ruby on Rails <http://rubyonrails.org/>`_ provides a web development framework that makes
it easy to create websites with Ruby.

AWS provides the :code:`aws-sdk-rails` gem to enable easy integration with Rails.
You can use |AEBlong|, |OPSlong|, |ACDlong|, or the
`AWS Rails Provisioner <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-rails-provisioner>`_
to deploy and run your Rails applications in the AWS Cloud.

For information on installing and using the :code:`aws-sdk-rails` gem,
see the GitHub repository https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-rails.
