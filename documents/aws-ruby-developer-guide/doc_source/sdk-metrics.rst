   :keywords: |sdk|, |CSM| for Enterprise Support with |language|, use |language| to monitor AWS Services

|CSMmerge| enables enterprise customers to collect metrics from AWS SDKs on their hosts
and clients shared with AWS Enterprise Support.
|CSM| provides information that helps speed up detection and diagnosis of issues occurring in connections
to AWS services for AWS Enterprise Support customers.

As telemetry is collected on each host, it is relayed via UDP to localhost,
where the |CW| agent aggregates the data and sends it to the |CSM| service.
Therefore, to receive metrics, you must add the |CW| agent to your instance.
