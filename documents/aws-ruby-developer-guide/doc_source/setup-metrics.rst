Set up |CSM| in the |sdk|
#########################

.. meta::
   :description: Configure an agent for |CSM| for Enterprise Support with the |sdk|.
   :keywords: |sdk|, |CSM| for Enterprise Support with |language|, use |language| to monitor AWS Services

The following steps demonstrate how to set up |CSM| for the |sdk|.
These steps pertain to an |EC2| instance running Amazon Linux for a client application that is using the |sdk|.
|CSM| is also available for your production environments if you enable it while configuring the |sdk|.

To use |CSM|, run the latest version of the |CW| agent.

.. Learn how to |CW_IAM_CSM| in the Amazon |CW| User Guide.

For details about |IAM| Permissions for |CSM|, see :doc:`authorize-metrics`.

To set up |CSM| with the |sdk|:

#. Create an application with an |sdk| client to use an AWS service.

#. Host your project on an |EC2| instance or in your local environment.

#. Install and use the latest version of the |sdk|.

#. Install and configure a |CW| agent on an |EC2| instance or in your local environment.

#. Authorize |CSM| to collect and send metrics.

#. :ref:`enable_sdk_metrics`.

For more information, see:

- :ref:`update_cw_agent`.

- :ref:`disable_sdk_metrics`.

.. _enable_sdk_metrics:

Enable |CSM| for the |sdk|
==========================

By default, |CSM| is turned off, and the port is set to 31000.
The following are the default parameters.

.. code-block:: sh

   //default values
   [
     'enabled' => false,
     'port' => 31000,
   ]

Enabling |CSM| is independent of configuring your credentials to use an AWS service.

You can enable |CSM| by setting environment variables or by using the AWS Shared config file.

.. _enable_csm_option_1:

Option 1: Set Environment Variables
-----------------------------------

The SDK first checks the profile specified in the environment variable under ``AWS_PROFILE``
to determine if |CSM| is enabled.

To turn on |CSM|, add the following to your environmental variables.

``export AWS_CSM_ENABLED=true``

Other configuration settings are available, 
see :doc:`update_cw_agent` for details.
For more information about using shared files, see the environment variables
information in :doc:`configuring-sdk`.

.. Note::

   Enabling |CSM| does not configure your credentials to use an AWS service.
   To do that, see :ref:`specifying-credentials`.

.. _enable_csm_option_2:

Option 2: AWS Shared Config File
--------------------------------

If no |CSM| configuration is found in the environment variables,
the |sdk| looks for your customized AWS profile field.
Then it checks the ``aws_csm`` profile.
To enable |CSM|, add ``csm_enabled`` to the shared config file *~/.aws/config*.

.. code-block:: sh
   
    [default]
    csm_enabled = true

    [profile aws_csm]
    csm_enabled = true

Other configuration settings are available, 
see :doc:`update_cw_agent` for details.
For more information about using shared files, see the environment variables
information in :doc:`configuring-sdk`.

.. Note::

   Enabling |CSM| does not configure your credentials to use an AWS service.
   To do that, see :ref:`specifying-credentials`.

.. _update_cw_agent:

Update a |CW| Agent
===================

To make changes to the port ID,
set the values and then restart any AWS jobs that are currently active.

.. _update_cw_agent_option1:

Option 1: Set Environment Variables
-----------------------------------

Most AWS services use the default port. But if the service you want |CSM| to monitor uses a unique port,
add ``AWS_CSM_PORT=[PORT-NUMBER]``, where PORT-NUMBER is the port number, to the host's environment variables.

.. code-block:: sh

    export AWS_CSM_ENABLED=true
    export AWS_CSM_PORT=1234

.. _update_cw_agent_option2:

Option 2: AWS Shared Config File
--------------------------------

Most services use the default port.
If your service requires a unique port ID,
add ``AWS_CSM_PORT=[PORT-NUMBER]``, where PORT-NUMBER is the port number, to *~/.aws/config*.

.. code-block:: sh

    [default]
    csm_enabled = false
    csm_port = 1234

    [profile aws_csm]
    csm_enabled = false
    csm_port = 1234

.. _restart_csm:

Restart |CSM|
-------------

To restart a job, run the following commands.

.. code-block:: sh

    amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a stop;
    amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a start;

.. _disable_sdk_metrics:

Disable |CSM|
=============

To turn off |CSM|, set ``csm_enabled`` to **false** in your environment variables
or in your AWS Shared config file *~/.aws/config*.
Then restart your |CW| agent so that the changes can take effect.

.. _set_csm_enabled_false:

Set ``csm_enabled`` to **false**
--------------------------------

.. _set_csm_enabled_false_option1:

Option 1: Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``export AWS_CSM_ENABLED=false``

.. _set_csm_enabled_false_option1:

Option 2: AWS Shared Config File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: 

   Environment variables override the AWS Shared config file.
   If |CSM| is enabled in the environment variables, the |CSM| remains enabled.

.. code-block:: sh

    [default]
    csm_enabled = false

    [profile aws_csm]
    csm_enabled = false

.. _stop_csm_restart_cw_agent:

Stop |CSM| and Restart |CW| Agent
---------------------------------

To disable |CSM|, use the following command.

``sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a stop && echo "Done"``

If you are using other |CW| features, restart |CW| with the following command.

``amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a start;``
