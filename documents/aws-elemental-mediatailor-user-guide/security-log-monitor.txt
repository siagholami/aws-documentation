Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of AWS Elemental MediaTailor and your AWS solutions. You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multi-point failure if one occurs. AWS provides several tools for monitoring your MediaTailor resources and responding to potential incidents:
Amazon CloudWatch Alarms
Using CloudWatch alarms, you watch a single metric over a time period that you specify. If the metric exceeds a given threshold, a notification is sent to an Amazon SNS topic or AWS Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch alarms don't invoke actions because they are in a particular state. Rather, the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods. For more information, see Monitoring AWS Elemental MediaTailor with Amazon CloudWatch Metrics.
AWS CloudTrail Logs
CloudTrail provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in AWS Elemental MediaTailor. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to MediaTailor, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details. For more information, see Logging AWS Elemental MediaTailor API Calls with AWS CloudTrail.
AWS Trusted Advisor
Trusted Advisor draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers. Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps. All AWS customers have access to five Trusted Advisor checks. Customers with a Business or Enterprise support plan can view all Trusted Advisor checks.
