# Ad Tracking Reporting in AWS Elemental MediaTailor<a name="ad-reporting"></a>

Beacons are sent to the ad server to track and report on how much of an ad that a viewer has watched\. AWS Elemental MediaTailor provides server\-side ad reporting \(MediaTailor tracks the ad and sends beacons\) or client\-side tracking \(the client player tracks the ad and sends beacons\)\. The type of reporting that is used in a playback session depends on the request that the player uses to initiate the session in MediaTailor\.
