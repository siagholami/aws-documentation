Main Configuration Fields
When you create a configuration, you must complete at least the main configuration fields, described here.
Configuration name
Enter a unique name that describes the configuration. The name is the primary identifier for the configuration. The maximum length allowed is 512 characters.
Video content source
 Enter the URL prefix for the manifest for this stream, minus the asset ID. The maximum length is 512 characters.
For example, the URL prefix http://origin-server.com/a/ is valid for an HLS master manifest URL of http://origin-server.com/a/master.m3u8 and for a DASH manifest URL of http://origin-server.com/a/dash.mpd. Alternatively, you can enter a shorter prefix such as http://origin-server.com, but the /a/ must be included in the asset ID in the player request for content. 
If your content origin uses HTTPS, its certificate must be from a well-known certificate authority. (It can't be a self-signed certificate.) Otherwise, AWS Elemental MediaTailor fails to connect to the content origin and can't serve manifests in response to player requests.
Ad decision server
 Enter the URL for your ad decision server (ADS). This is either the URL with variables as described in Step 3: Configure ADS Request URL and Query Parameters, or the static VAST URL that you are using for testing purposes. The maximum length is 25,000 characters.
If your ADS uses HTTPS, its certificate must be from a well-known certificate authority. (It can't be a self-signed certificate.) The same also applies to mezzanine ad URLs returned by the ADS. Otherwise, AWS Elemental MediaTailor can't retrieve and stitch ads into the manifests from the content origin.
