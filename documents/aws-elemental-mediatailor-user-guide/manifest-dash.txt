DASH .mpd Manifests
AWS Elemental MediaTailor supports .mpd live and video on demand (VOD) manifests that follow the guidelines for the DASH dynamic profile. MediaTailor accepts multi-period and single-period DASH-compliant manifest inputs, and delivers multi-period DASH-compliant manifest outputs. 
Input manifests must have the following:
 At least one Period element with a start attribute. 
 SCTE-35 event streams with splice info settings for either splice insertortime signal. The settings can be provided in clear XML or in base64-encoded binary. 
 Segment templates with segment timelines. 
For published manifests, MediaTailor requires that updates by the origin server leave the following unchanged: 
 Period start times, specified in the start attribute. 
 Values of presentationTimeOffset in the segment templates of the period representations. 
As a best practice, give the ad avails the same AdaptationSet and Representation settings as the content stream periods. AWS Elemental MediaTailor uses these settings to transcode the ads to match the content stream, for smooth switching between the two.
