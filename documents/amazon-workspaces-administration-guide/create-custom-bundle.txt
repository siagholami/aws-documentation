Create a Custom WorkSpaces Image and Bundle
If you've launched a Windows or Amazon Linux WorkSpace and have customized it, you can create a custom image and custom bundles from that WorkSpace.
A custom image contains only the OS, software, and settings for the WorkSpace. A custom bundle is a combination of both that custom image and the hardware from which a WorkSpace can be launched.
After you create a custom image, you can build a custom bundle that combines the custom image and the underlying compute and storage configuration that you select. You can then specify this custom bundle when you launch new WorkSpaces to ensure that the new WorkSpaces have the same consistent configuration (hardware and software).
You can use the same custom image to create various custom bundles by selecting different compute and storage options for each bundle. 
Important
If you plan to create an image from a Windows 10 WorkSpace, note that image creation is not supported on Windows 10 systems that have been upgraded from one version of Windows 10 to a newer version of Windows 10 (a Windows feature/version upgrade). However, Windows cumulative or security updates are supported by the WorkSpaces image-creation process.
After January 14, 2020, images cannot be created from public Windows 7 bundles. You might want to consider migrating your Windows 7 WorkSpaces to Windows 10. For more information, see Migrate a WorkSpace.
Custom bundles cost as same as the public bundles they are created from. For more information about pricing, see Amazon WorkSpaces Pricing.

Requirements to Create Windows Custom Images

The status of the WorkSpace must be Available and its modification state must be None.
All applications and user profiles on WorkSpaces images must be compatible with Microsoft Sysprep.
All applications to be included in the image must be installed on the C drive.
The user profile must exist, must be located at D:\Users\username, and its total size (files and data) must be less than 10 GB.
The C drive must have at least 12 GB of available space.
All application services running on the WorkSpace must use a local system account instead of domain user credentials. For example, you cannot have a Microsoft SQL Server Express installation running with a domain user's credentials.
The WorkSpace must not be encrypted. Image creation from an encrypted WorkSpace is not currently supported.
The following components are required in an image. Without these components, the WorkSpaces that you launch from the image will not function correctly:
Windows PowerShell version 3.0 or later
Remote Desktop Services
AWS PV drivers
Windows Remote Management (WinRM)
Teradici PCoIP agents and drivers
STXHD agents and drivers
AWS and WorkSpaces certificates
Skylight agent

Requirements to Create Amazon Linux Custom Images

The status of the WorkSpace must be Available and its modification state must be None.
All applications to be included in the image must be installed outside of the user volume (the /home directory).
The root volume (/) should be less than 97% full.
The WorkSpace must not be encrypted. Image creation from an encrypted WorkSpace is not currently supported.
The following components are required in an image. Without these components, the WorkSpaces that you launch from the image will not function correctly:
Cloud-init
Teradici PCoIP agents and drivers
Skylight agent

Best Practices
Before you create an image from a WorkSpace, do the following:
 Use a separate VPC that is not connected to your production environment.
 Deploy the WorkSpace in a private subnet and use a NAT instance for outbound traffic.
 Use a small Simple AD directory.
 Use the smallest volume size for the source WorkSpace, and then adjust the volume size as needed when creating the custom bundle.
 Install all operating system updates (except Windows feature/version updates) and all application updates on the WorkSpace. For more information, see the Important note at the start of this topic.
 Delete cached data from the WorkSpace that shouldn't be included in the bundle (for example, browser history, cached files, and browser cookies).
 Delete configuration settings from the WorkSpace that shouldn't be included in the bundle (for example, email profiles).
 Switch to dynamic IP address settings using DHCP.
 Make sure that you haven't exceeded your quota for WorkSpace images allowed in a Region. By default, you're allowed 40 WorkSpace images per Region. If you've reached this quota, new attempts to create an image will fail. To request a quota increase, use the Amazon WorkSpaces Limits form.
 Make sure that you aren't trying to create an image from an encrypted WorkSpace. Image creation from an encrypted WorkSpace is not currently supported.
 If you're running any antivirus software on the WorkSpace, disable it while you're attempting to create an image.
 If you have a firewall enabled on your WorkSpace, make sure that it isn't blocking any necessary ports. For more information, see IP Address and Port Requirements for Amazon WorkSpaces.
 For Windows WorkSpaces, don't configure any Group Policy Objects (GPOs) before image creation.
 For Windows WorkSpaces, do not customize the default user profile (C:\Users\Default) before creating an image. We recommend making any customizations to the user profile through GPOs, and applying them after image creation. GPOs can be easily modified or rolled back, and are therefore less prone to error than customizations made to the default user profile.
 For Linux WorkSpaces, see also the  "Best Practices to Prepare Your Amazon WorkSpaces for Linux Images" whitepaper.
Step 1: Run the Image Checker
Note
The Image Checker is available only for Windows WorkSpaces. If you are creating an image from a Linux WorkSpace, skip to Step 2: Create a Custom Image and Custom Bundle.
To confirm that your Windows WorkSpace meets the requirements for image creation, we recommend running the Image Checker. The Image Checker performs a series of tests on the WorkSpace that you want to use to create your image, and provides guidance on how to resolve any issues it finds.
Important
The WorkSpace must pass all of the tests run by the Image Checker before you can use it for image creation. 
Before you run the Image Checker, verify that the latest Windows security and cumulative updates are installed on your WorkSpace.
The Image Checker does not check the user profile size for Windows 10 WorkSpaces. If you have a Windows 10 WorkSpace, make sure that the user profile size is less than 10 GB.
To get the Image Checker, do one of the following:
 Reboot your WorkSpace. The Image Checker is downloaded automatically during the reboot and installed at C:\Program Files\Amazon\ImageChecker.exe.
 Download the Amazon WorkSpaces Image Checker from https://tools.amazonworkspaces.com/ImageChecker.zip and extract the ImageChecker.exe file. Copy this file to C:\Program Files\Amazon\.
To run the Image Checker


On the Windows Start menu, choose Windows System, then choose Command Prompt.


In the Command Prompt window, enter the following commands, one at a time, and press Enter after each command.


c:
   cd C:\Program Files\Amazon
   ImageChecker.exe


When asked "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?" choose Yes.


In the Amazon WorkSpaces Image Checker dialog box, choose Run.


After each test is completed, you can view the status of the test.


For any test with a status of FAILED, choose Info to display information about how to resolve the issue that caused the failure. For more information about how to resolve these issues, see Tips for Resolving Issues Detected by the Image Checker.
If any tests display a status of WARNING, choose the Fix All Warnings button.
The tool generates an output log file in the same directory where the Image Checker is located. By default, this file is located at C:\Program Files\Amazon\ImageChecker_yyyyMMddhhmmss.log.
Tip
Do not delete this log file. If an issue occurs, this log file might be helpful in troubleshooting.


If applicable, resolve any issues that cause test failures and warnings, and repeat the process of running the Image Checker until the WorkSpace passes all tests. All failures and warnings must be resolved before you can create an image.


After your WorkSpace passes all tests, you see a Validation Successful message. You are now ready to create a custom bundle.


Tips for Resolving Issues Detected by the Image Checker
In addition to consulting the following tips for resolving issues that are detected by the Image Checker, be sure to review the Image Checker log file at C:\Program Files\Amazon\ImageChecker_yyyyMMddhhmmss.log.
PowerShell version 3.0 or later must be installed
Install the latest version of  Microsoft Windows PowerShell.
Important
The PowerShell execution policy for a WorkSpace must be set to allow RemoteSigned scripts. To check the execution policy, run the Get-ExecutionPolicy PowerShell command. If the execution policy is not set to Unrestricted or RemoteSigned, run the Set-ExecutionPolicy â€“ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned command to change the value of the execution policy. The RemoteSigned setting allows the execution of scripts on Amazon WorkSpaces, which is required to create an image.
Only the C and D drives can be present
Only the C and D drives can be present on a WorkSpace that's used for imaging. Remove all other drives, including virtual drives.
No pending reboot due to Windows Updates can be detected

The Create Image process can't be run until Windows has been rebooted to finish installing security or cumulative updates. Reboot Windows to apply these updates, and make sure that no other pending Windows security or cumulative updates need to be installed.
Image creation is not supported on Windows 10 systems that have been upgraded from one version of Windows 10 to a newer version of Windows 10 (a Windows feature/version upgrade). However, Windows cumulative or security updates are supported by the WorkSpaces image-creation process.

The Sysprep file must exist and can't be blank
If there are problems with your Sysprep file, contact the AWS Support Center to get your EC2Config or EC2Launch repaired.
The user profile size must be less than 10 GB
The user profile (D:\Users\username) must be less than 10 GB total. Remove files as needed to reduce the size of the user profile.
Drive C must have enough free space
You must have at least 12 GB of free space on drive C. Remove files as needed to free up space on drive C.
No services can be running under a domain account
To run the Create Image process, no services on the WorkSpace can be running under a domain account. All services must be running under a local account.
To run services under a local account


Open C:\Program Files\Amazon\ImageChecker_yyyyMMddhhmmss.log and find the list of services that are running under a domain account.


In the Windows search box, enter services.msc to open the Windows Services Manager.


Under Log On As, look for the services that are running under domain accounts. (Services running as Local System, Local Service, or Network Service do not interfere with image creation.)


Select a service that is running under a domain account, and then choose Action, Properties.


Open the Log On tab. Under Log on as, choose Local System account. 


Choose OK.


Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager (Amazon WAM) must be installed
If you have used Amazon WAM to assign applications to your users, you must set up the Amazon WAM installer on your WorkSpace. When you are finished, the Amazon WAM shortcut will appear on your WorkSpace desktop.
The WorkSpace must be configured to use DHCP
You must configure all network adapters on the WorkSpace to use DHCP instead of static IP addresses.
To set all network adapters to use DHCP


In the Windows search box, enter control panel to open the Control Panel.


Choose Network and Internet.


Choose Network and Sharing Center.


Choose Change adapter settings, and select an adapter.


Choose Change settings of this connection.


On the Networking tab, select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and then choose Properties.


In the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties dialog box, select Obtain an IP address automatically.


Choose OK.


Repeat this process for all network adapters on the WorkSpace.


Remote Desktop Services must be enabled
The Create Image process requires Remote Desktop Services to be enabled.
To enable Remote Desktop Services


In the Windows search box, enter services.msc to open the Windows Services Manager.


In the Name column, find Remote Desktop Services.


Select Remote Desktop Services, and then choose Action, Properties.


On the General tab, for Startup type, choose Manual or Automatic.


Choose OK.


A user profile must exist
The WorkSpace that you're using to create images must have a user profile (D:\Users\username). If this test fails, contact the AWS Support Center for assistance. 
The environment variable path must be properly configured
The environment variable path for the local machine is missing entries for System32 and for Windows PowerShell. These entries are required for Create Image to run.
To configure your environment variable path


In the Windows search box, enter environment variables and then choose Edit the system environment variables.


In the System Properties dialog box, open the Advanced tab, and choose Environment Variables.


In the Environment Variables dialog box, under System variables, select the Path entry and then choose Edit.


Choose New, and add the following path:


C:\Windows\System32

Choose New again, and add the following path:

C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\


Choose OK.


Restart the WorkSpace.
Tip
The order in which items appear in the environment variable path matters. To determine the correct order, you might want to compare the environment variable path of your WorkSpace with one from a newly created WorkSpace or a new Windows instance.


Windows Modules Installer must be enabled
The Create Image process requires the Windows Modules Installer service to be enabled.
To enable the Windows Modules Installer service


In the Windows search box, enter services.msc to open the Windows Services Manager.


In the Name column, find Windows Modules Installer.


Select Windows Modules Installer, and then choose Action, Properties.


On the General tab, for Startup type, choose Manual or Automatic.


Choose OK.


Amazon SSM Agent must be disabled
The Create Image process requires the Amazon SSM Agent service to be disabled.
To disable the Amazon SSM Agent service


In the Windows search box, enter services.msc to open the Windows Services Manager.


In the Name column, find Amazon SSM Agent.


Select Amazon SSM Agent, and then choose Action, Properties.


On the General tab, for Startup type, choose Disabled.


Choose OK.


SSL3 and TLS version 1.2 must be enabled
To configure SSL/TLS for Windows, see  How to Enable TLS 1.2 in the Microsoft Windows documentation. 
Only one user profile can exist on the WorkSpace
There can be only one WorkSpaces user profile (D:\Users\username) on the WorkSpace that you're using to create images. Delete any user profiles that don't belong to the intended user of the WorkSpace.
For image creation to work, your WorkSpace can have only three user profiles on it:
 The user profile of the intended user of the WorkSpace (D:\Users\username)
 The default user profile (also known as Default Profile)
 The Administrator user profile
If there are additional user profiles, you can delete them through the advanced system properties in the Windows Control Panel.
To delete a user profile


To access the advanced system properties, do one of the following:
    Press the Windows keyPause Break, and then choose Advanced system settings in the left pane of the Control Panel > System and Security > System dialog box.
    In the Windows search box, enter control panel. In the Control Panel, choose System and Security, then choose System, and then choose Advanced system settings in the left pane of the Control Panel > System and Security > System dialog box.


In the System Properties dialog box, on the Advanced tab, choose Settings under User Profiles.


If any profile is listed other than the Administrator profile, the Default Profile, and the profile of the intended WorkSpaces user, select that additional profile and choose Delete.


When asked if you want to delete the profile, choose Yes.


If necessary, repeat Steps 3 and 4 to remove any other profiles that don't belong on the WorkSpace.


Choose OK twice and close the Control Panel.


Restart the WorkSpace.


No AppX packages can be in a staged state
One or more AppX packages are in a staged state. This might cause a Sysprep error during image creation.
To remove all staged AppX packages


In the Windows search box, enter powershell. Choose Run as Administrator.


When asked "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?", choose Yes.


In the Windows PowerShell window, enter the following commands to list all staged AppX packages, and press Enter after each one.


$workSpaceUserName = $env:username
$allAppxPackages = Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers
$packages = $allAppxPackages |    Where-Object { `
                                   (($_.PackageUserInformation -like "*S-1-5-18*" -and !($_.PackageUserInformation -like "*$workSpaceUserName*")) -and `
                                   ($_.PackageUserInformation -like "*Staged*" -or $_.PackageUserInformation -like "*Installed*")) -or `
                                   ((!($_.PackageUserInformation -like "*S-1-5-18*") -and $_.PackageUserInformation -like "*$workSpaceUserName*") -and `
                                   $_.PackageUserInformation -like "*Staged*")
                                   }

Enter the following command to remove all staged AppX packages, and press Enter.

$packages | Remove-AppxPackage -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Run the Image Checker again. If this test still fails, enter the following commands to remove all AppX packages, and press Enter after each one.

Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Windows must not have been upgraded from a previous version
Image creation is not supported on Windows systems that have been upgraded from one version of Windows 10 to a newer version of Windows 10 (a Windows feature/version upgrade).
To create images, use a WorkSpace that has not undergone a Windows feature/version upgrade.
The Windows rearm count must not be 0
The rearm feature allows you to extend the activation period for the trial version of Windows. The Create Image process requires that the rearm count be a value other than 0.
To check the Windows rearm count


On the Windows Start menu, choose Windows System, then choose Command Prompt.


In the Command Prompt window, enter the following command, and then press Enter.


cscript C:\Windows\System32\slmgr.vbs /dlv
To reset the rearm count to a value other than 0, see  Sysprep (Generalize) a Windows installation in the Microsoft Windows documentation.
Other Troubleshooting Tips
If your WorkSpace passes all of the tests run by the Image Checker, but you are still unable to create an image from the WorkSpace, check for the following issues:
 Make sure that the WorkSpace isn't assigned to a user within a Domain Guests group. To check if there are any domain accounts, run the following PowerShell command.
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Where-Object { $_.StartName -like "*$env:USERDOMAIN*" }
 For Windows 7 WorkSpaces only: If problems occur while the user profile is being copied during image creation, check for the following issues:
   Long profile paths can cause image creation errors. Make sure that the paths of all folders within the user profile are less than 261 characters.
   Make sure to grant full permissions on the profile folder to the system and all application packages.
   If any files in the user profile are locked by a process or are in use during image creation, copying the profile might fail.
 Some Group Policy Objects (GPOs) restrict access to the RDP certificate thumbprint when it is requested by the EC2Config service or the EC2Launch scripts during Windows instance configuration. Before you try to create an image, move the WorkSpace to a new organizational unit (OU) with blocked inheritance and no GPOs applied.
 Make sure that the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service is configured to start automatically. Do the following:


In the Windows search box, enter services.msc to open the Windows Services Manager.


In the Name column, find Windows Remote Management (WS-Management). 


Select Windows Remote Management (WS-Management), and then choose Action, Properties.


On the General tab, for Startup type, choose Automatic.


Choose OK.


Step 2: Create a Custom Image and Custom Bundle
After you have validated your WorkSpace image, you can proceed with creating your custom image and custom bundle.
To create a custom image and custom bundle


If you are still connected to the WorkSpace, disconnect.


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose WorkSpaces.


Select the WorkSpace and choose Actions, Create Image.


A message displays, prompting you to restart your WorkSpace before continuing. Restarting your WorkSpace updates your Amazon WorkSpaces software to the latest version.


Restart your WorkSpace by closing the message and following the steps in Restart a WorkSpace. When you're done, repeat Step 4 of this procedure, but this time choose Next when the restart message appears. To create an image, the status of the WorkSpace must be Available and its modification state must be None.


Enter an image name and a description that will help you identify the image, and then choose Create Image. While the image is being created, the status of the WorkSpace is Suspended and the WorkSpace is unavailable.


In the navigation pane, choose Images. The image is complete when the status of the WorkSpace changes to Available.


Select the image and choose Actions, Create Bundle.


Enter a bundle name and a description, and then do the following: 
    For Bundle Type, choose the hardware to use when launching WorkSpaces from this custom bundle.
    For Root Volume Size, leave the default value or enter a new value that is equal to or greater than the current size. Then, enter a value for User Volume Size.
The default available sizes for the root volume (for Microsoft Windows, the C drive, for Linux, /) and the user volume (for Windows, the D drive; for Linux, /home) are as follows: 
  Root: 80 GB, User: 10 GB, 50 GB, or 100 GB
  Root: 175 GB, User: 100 GB
  For Graphics and GraphicsPro WorkSpaces only: Root: 100 GB, User: 100 GB
Alternatively, you can expand the root and user volumes up to 2000 GB each.
Note
To ensure that your data is preserved, you cannot decrease the size of the root or user volumes after you launch a WorkSpace. Instead, make sure that you specify the minimum sizes for these volumes when launching a WorkSpace. You can launch a Value, Standard, Performance, Power, or PowerPro WorkSpace with a minimum of 80 GB for the root volume and 10 GB for the user volume. You can launch a Graphics or GraphicsPro WorkSpace with a minimum of 100 GB for the root volume and 100 GB for the user volume.


Choose Create Bundle.
