Launch a Virtual Desktop Using Amazon WorkSpaces
With Amazon WorkSpaces, you can provision virtual, cloud-based Microsoft Windows or Amazon Linux desktops for your users, known as WorkSpaces.
Note
The Computer Name value shown for a WorkSpace in the Amazon WorkSpaces console varies, depending on which type of WorkSpace you've launched (Linux or Windows). The computer name for a WorkSpace can be in one of these formats: 
Linux: A-1xxxxxxxxxxxx
Windows: IP-Cxxxxxx or WSAMZN-xxxxxxx or EC2AMAZ-xxxxxxx
For Windows WorkSpaces, the computer name format is determined by the bundle type, and in the case of WorkSpaces created from public bundles or from custom bundles based on public images, by when the public images were created.
Starting June 22, 2020, Windows WorkSpaces launched from public bundles have the WSAMZN-xxxxxxx format for their computer names instead of the IP-Cxxxxxx format.
For custom bundles based on a public image, if the public image was created before June 22, 2020, the computer names are in the EC2AMAZ-xxxxxxx format. If the public image was created on or after June 22, 2020, the computer names are in the WSAMZN-xxxxxxx format. 
For Bring Your Own License (BYOL) bundles, the EC2AMAZ-xxxxxxx format is used for the computer names by default.
If you've specified a custom format for the computer names in your custom or BYOL bundles, your custom format overrides these defaults. 
Amazon WorkSpaces uses a directory to store and manage information for your WorkSpaces and users. You can do any of the following:
 Create a Simple AD directory.
 Create an AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, also known as AWS Managed Microsoft AD.
 Connect to an existing Microsoft Active Directory by using Active Directory Connector.
 Create a trust relationship between your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory and your on-premises domain.
The following tutorials show you how to launch a WorkSpace by using the supported directory service options.
