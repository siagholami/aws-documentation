Manage WorkSpaces Users
As an administrator for Amazon WorkSpaces, you can perform the following tasks to manage WorkSpaces users.
Edit User Information
You can use the Amazon WorkSpaces console to edit the user information for a WorkSpace.
Note
This feature is available only if you use AWS Managed Microsoft AD or Simple AD. If you use Microsoft Active Directory through AD Connector or a trust relationship, you can manage users and groups by using  Active Directory.
To edit user information


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose WorkSpaces.


Select a user and choose Actions, Edit User.


Update First Name, Last Name, and Email as needed.


Choose Update.


Add or Delete Users
You can create new users from the Amazon WorkSpaces console only during the process of launching a WorkSpace, and you cannot delete users through the Amazon WorkSpaces console. Most user management tasks, including managing user groups, must be performed through your directory.
To add or delete users and groups
To add, delete, or otherwise manage users and groups, you must do this through your directory. You'll perform most administrative tasks for your WorkSpaces directory using directory management tools, such as the Active Directory Administration Tools. For more information, see Set Up Active Directory Administration Tools for Amazon WorkSpaces.
Important
Before you can remove a user, you must delete the WorkSpace assigned to that user. For more information, see Delete a WorkSpace.
The process you use for managing users and groups depends on which type of directory you're using.
 If you're using AWS Managed Microsoft AD, see  Manage Users and Groups in AWS Managed Microsoft AD in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide.
 If you're using Simple AD, see  Manage Users and Groups in Simple AD in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide. 
 If you use Microsoft Active Directory through AD Connector or a trust relationship, you can manage users and groups by using  Active Directory. 
Send an Invitation Email
You can send an invitation email to a user manually if needed.
Note
If you're using AD Connector, welcome emails aren't automatically sent to your users, so you must send them manually.
To resend an invitation email


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose WorkSpaces.


On the WorkSpaces page, use the search box to search for the user you want to send an invitation to, and then select the corresponding WorkSpace from the search results. You can select only one WorkSpace at a time.


Choose Actions, Invite User.


Copy the email body text and paste it into an email to the user using your own email application. You can modify the body text if desired. When the invitation email is ready, send it to the user.
