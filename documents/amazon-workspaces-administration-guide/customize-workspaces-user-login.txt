Customize How Users Log In to Their WorkSpaces
Customize your users' access to WorkSpaces by using uniform resource identifiers (URIs) to provide a simplified login experience that integrates with existing workflows in your organization. For example, you can automatically generate login URIs that register your users by using their WorkSpaces registration code. As a result: 
 Users can bypass the manual registration process.
 Their user names are automatically entered on their WorkSpaces client login page.
 If multi-factor authentication (MFA) is used in your organization, their user names and MFA codes are automatically entered on their client login page.
URI access works with both Region-based registration codes (for example, WSpdxABC12D) and fully qualified domain name (FQDN) based registration codes (for example, desktop.example.com). For more information about creating and using FQDN-based registration codes, see Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces.
You can configure URI access to WorkSpaces for client applications on the following supported devices: 
 Windows computers
 macOS computers
 Ubuntu Linux 18.04 computers
 iPads
 Android devices
To use URIs to access their WorkSpaces, users must first install the client application for their device by opening https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/ and following the directions.
URI access is supported on the Firefox and Chrome browsers on Windows and macOS computers, on the Firefox browser on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 computers, and on the Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers on Windows computers. For more information about WorkSpaces clients, see Amazon WorkSpaces Clients in the Amazon WorkSpaces User Guide.
Note
On Android devices, URI access works only with the Firefox browser, not with the Google Chrome browser.
To configure URI access to WorkSpaces, use any of the URI formats described in the following table.
Note
If the data component of your URI includes any of the following reserved characters, we recommend that you use percent-encoding in the data component to avoid ambiguity: 
@ : / ? & =
For example, if you have user names that include any of these characters, you should percent-encode those user names in your URI. For more information, see Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax.

Description




workspaces://

workspaces://@registrationcode
Registers a user by using their WorkSpaces registration code. Also displays the client login page.


workspaces://username@registrationcode
Registers a user by using their WorkSpaces registration code. Also automatically enters the user name in the username field on the client login page.


workspaces://username@registrationcode?MFACode=mfa
Registers a user by using their WorkSpaces registration code. Also automatically enters the user name in the username field and the multi-factor authentication (MFA) code in the MFA code field on the client login page.


workspaces://@registrationcode?MFACode=mfa
Registers a user by using their WorkSpaces registration code. Also automatically enters the multi-factor authentication (MFA) code in the MFA code field on the client login page.



Note
If users open a URI link when they are already connected to a WorkSpace from a Windows client, a new WorkSpaces session opens and their original WorkSpaces session remains open. If users open a URI link when they are connected to a WorkSpace from a macOS, iPad, or Android client, no new session opens; only their original WorkSpaces session remains open.
