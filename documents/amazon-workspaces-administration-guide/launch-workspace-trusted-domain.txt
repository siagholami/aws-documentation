Launch a WorkSpace Using a Trusted Domain
Amazon WorkSpaces enables you to provision virtual, cloud-based Microsoft Windows desktops for your users, known as WorkSpaces.
Amazon WorkSpaces uses directories to store and manage information for your WorkSpaces and users. For your directory, you can choose from Simple AD, AD Connector, or AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, also known as AWS Managed Microsoft AD. In addition, you can establish a trust relationship between your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory and your on-premises domain.
In this tutorial, we launch a WorkSpace that uses a trust relationship. For tutorials that use the other options, see Launch a Virtual Desktop Using Amazon WorkSpaces.

Before You Begin

Launching WorkSpaces with user accounts in a separate trusted domain works with AWS Managed Microsoft AD when it is configured with a trust relationship to your on-premises directory. However, WorkSpaces using Simple AD or AD Connector cannot launch WorkSpaces for users from a trusted domain.
Amazon WorkSpaces is not available in every Region. Verify the supported Regions and select a Region for your WorkSpaces. For more information about the supported Regions, see Amazon WorkSpaces Pricing by AWS Region.
When you launch a WorkSpace, you must select a WorkSpace bundle. A bundle is a combination of storage, compute, and software resources. For more information, see Amazon WorkSpaces Bundles.
When you create a directory using AWS Directory Service or launch a WorkSpace, you must create or select a virtual private cloud configured with a public subnet and two private subnets. For more information, see Configure a VPC for Amazon WorkSpaces.

Step 1: Establish a Trust Relationship
To set up the trust relationship


Set up AWS Managed Microsoft AD in your virtual private cloud (VPC). For more information, see Create Your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide.


Create a trust relationship between your AWS Managed Microsoft AD and your on-premises domain. Ensure that the trust is configured as a two-way trust. For more information, see Tutorial: Create a Trust Relationship Between Your AWS Managed Microsoft AD and Your On-Premises Domain in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide.


A two-way trust is required so that on-premises credentials can be used to manage and authenticate with WorkSpaces, and so that WorkSpaces can be provisioned to on-premises users and groups.
Step 2: Create a WorkSpace
After you establish a trust relationship between your AWS Managed Microsoft AD and your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory domain, you can provision WorkSpaces for users in the on-premises domain.
Note that you must ensure that GPO settings are replicated across domains before you can apply them to Amazon WorkSpaces.
To launch workspaces for users in a trusted on-premises domain


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose WorkSpaces.


Choose Launch WorkSpaces.


On the Select a Directory page, choose the directory that you just registered and then choose Next Step.


On the Identify Users page, do the following:


For Select trust from forest, select the trust relationship that you created.


Select the users from the on-premises domain and then choose Add Selected.


Choose Next Step.


Select the bundle to be used for the WorkSpaces and then choose Next Step.


Choose the running mode, choose the encryption settings, and configure any tags. When you are finished, choose Next Step.


Choose Launch WorkSpaces. Note that it can take up to 20 minutes for the WorkSpaces to become available, and up to 40 minutes if encryption is enabled. The initial status of the WorkSpace is PENDING. When the launch is complete, the status is AVAILABLE.


Send invitations to the email address for each user. For more information, see Send an Invitation Email.


Step 3: Connect to the WorkSpace
After you receive the invitation email, you can connect to your WorkSpace. Users can enter their user names as username, corp\username, or corp.example.com\username).
To connect to the WorkSpace


Open the link in the invitation email. When prompted, enter a password and activate the user. Remember this password as you will need it to sign in to your WorkSpace.
Note
Passwords are case-sensitive and must be between 8 and 64 characters in length, inclusive. Passwords must contain at least one character from three of the following categories: lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and \~!@#$%^&*_-=`|\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?/.


Review Amazon WorkSpaces Clients in the Amazon WorkSpaces User Guide for more information about the requirements for each client, and then do one of the following: 
    When prompted, download one of the client applications or launch Web Access.
    If you aren't prompted and you haven't installed a client application already, open https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/ and download one of the client applications or launch Web Access.
Note
You cannot use a web browser (Web Access) to connect to Amazon Linux WorkSpaces.


Start the client, enter the registration code from the invitation email, and choose Register.


When prompted to sign in, enter the user name and password for the user, and then choose Sign In.


(Optional) When prompted to save your credentials, choose Yes.


Next Steps
You can continue to customize the WorkSpace that you just created. For example, you can install software and then create a custom bundle from your WorkSpace. If you are finished with your WorkSpace, you can delete it. For more information, see the following documentation.
