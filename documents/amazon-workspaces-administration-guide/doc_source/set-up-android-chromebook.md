# Set Up Android for Chromebooks<a name="set-up-android-chromebook"></a>

Version 2\.4\.13 is the final release of the Amazon WorkSpaces Chromebook client application\. Because [ Google is phasing out support for Chrome Apps](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/moving-forward-from-chrome-apps.html), there will be no further updates to the WorkSpaces Chromebook client application, and its use is unsupported\.

For [ Chromebooks that support installing Android applications](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps), we recommend using the [ Amazon WorkSpaces Android client application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/amazon-workspaces-android-client.html) instead\.

Some Chromebooks launched before 2019 must be enabled to [ install Android apps](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/7021273) before users can install the Amazon WorkSpaces Android client application\. For more information, see [ Chrome OS Systems Supporting Android Apps](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps)\.

To remotely manage enabling your users' Chromebooks to install Android apps, see [Set up Android on Chrome devices](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/topic/9042368)\.
