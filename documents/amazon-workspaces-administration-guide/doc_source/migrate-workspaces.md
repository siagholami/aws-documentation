# Migrate a WorkSpace<a name="migrate-workspaces"></a>

You can migrate a WorkSpace from one bundle to another, while retaining the data on the user volume\. You can use this feature to migrate WorkSpaces from the Windows 7 desktop experience to the Windows 10 desktop experience\. You can also use this feature to migrate WorkSpaces from one public or custom bundle to another\. For example, you can migrate from GPU\-enabled \(Graphics and GraphicsPro\) bundles to non\-GPU\-enabled bundles, and vice versa\. For more information about Amazon WorkSpaces bundles, see [WorkSpace Bundles and Images](amazon-workspaces-bundles.md)\.

The migration process recreates the WorkSpace by using a new root volume from the target bundle image and the user volume from the last available snapshot of the original WorkSpace\. A new user profile is generated during migration for better compatibility\. The old user profile is renamed, and then certain files in the old user profile are moved to the new user profile\. \(For details about what gets moved, see [What Happens During Migration](#during-migration)\.\)

The migration process takes up to one hour per WorkSpace\. When you initiate the migration process, a new WorkSpace is created\. If an error occurs that prevents successful migration, the original WorkSpace is recovered and returned to its original state, and the new WorkSpace is terminated\.

## Migration Limits<a name="migration-limits"></a>
+ You cannot migrate to a public or custom Windows 7 desktop experience bundle\. You also cannot migrate to Bring Your Own License \(BYOL\) Windows 7 bundles\.
+ You can migrate BYOL WorkSpaces only to other BYOL bundles\.
+ You cannot migrate a WorkSpace created from public or custom bundles to a BYOL bundle\.
+ You cannot migrate between Plus bundles \(those that include Microsoft Office\) and non\-Plus bundles\. You can migrate from a Plus bundle to another Plus bundle, or between a non\-Plus bundle and another non\-Plus bundle\.
+ Migrating Linux WorkSpaces is not currently supported\.
+ In AWS Regions that support more than one language, you can migrate WorkSpaces between language bundles\.
+ The source and target bundles must be different\. \(However, in Regions that support more than one language, you can migrate to the same Windows 10 bundle as long as the languages differ\.\) If you want to refresh your WorkSpace using the same bundle, [rebuild the WorkSpace](rebuild-workspace.md) instead\.
+ You cannot migrate WorkSpaces across Regions\.
+ In some cases, if migration is unable to finish successfully, you might not receive an error message, and it might appear that the migration process did not start\. If the WorkSpace bundle remains the same one hour after attempting migration, the migration is unsuccessful\. Contact the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/) for assistance\.

## What Happens During Migration<a name="during-migration"></a>

During migration, the data on the user volume \(drive D\) is preserved, but all of the data on the root volume \(drive C\) is lost\. This means that none of the installed applications, settings, and changes to the registry are preserved\. The old user profile folder is renamed with the `.NotMigrated` suffix, and a new user profile is created\.

The migration process recreates drive D based on the last snapshot of the original user volume\. During the new WorkSpace's first boot, the migration process moves the original `D:\Users\%USERNAME%` folder to a folder named `D:\Users\%USERNAME%MMddyyTHHmmss%.NotMigrated`\. A new `D:\Users\%USERNAME%\` folder is generated by the new OS\.

After the new user profile is created, the files in the following user shell folders are moved from the old `.NotMigrated` profile to the new profile:
+ `D:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop`
+ `D:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents`
+ `D:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads`
+ `D:\Users\%USERNAME%\Favorites`
+ `D:\Users\%USERNAME%\Music`
+ `D:\Users\%USERNAME%\Pictures`
+ `D:\Users\%USERNAME%\Videos`

**Important**  
The migration process attempts to move the files from the old user profile to the new profile\. Any files that weren't moved during migration remain in the `D:\Users\%USERNAME%MMddyyTHHmmss%.NotMigrated` folder\. If the migration is successful, you can see which files got moved in `C:\Program Files\Amazon\WorkspacesConfig\Logs\MigrationLogs`\. You can manually move any files that didn't get moved automatically\.

Any tags assigned to the original WorkSpace are carried over during migration, and the running mode of the WorkSpace is preserved\. However, the new WorkSpace gets a new WorkSpace ID, computer name, and IP address\.

## Best Practices<a name="migration-best-practices"></a>

Before you migrate a WorkSpace, do the following:
+ Back up any important data on drive C to another location\. All data on drive C is erased during migration\.
+ Make sure that the WorkSpace being migrated is at least 12 hours old, to ensure that a snapshot of the user volume has been created\. On the **Migrate WorkSpaces** page in the Amazon WorkSpaces console, you can see the time of the last snapshot\. Any data created after the last snapshot is lost during migration\.
+ To avoid potential data loss, make sure that your users log out of their WorkSpaces and don't log back in until after the migration process is finished\. Note that WorkSpaces cannot be migrated when they are in `ADMIN_MAINTENANCE` mode\.
+ Make sure that the WorkSpaces you want to migrate have a status of `AVAILABLE`, `STOPPED`, or `ERROR`\.
+ Make sure that you have enough IP addresses for the WorkSpaces you are migrating\. During migration, new IP addresses will be allocated for the WorkSpaces\.
+ If you are using scripts to migrate WorkSpaces, migrate them in batches of no more than 25 WorkSpaces at a time\.

## Troubleshooting<a name="migration_troubleshooting"></a>
+ If your users report missing files after migration, check to see if their user profile files did not get moved during the migration process\. You can see which files got moved in `C:\Program Files\Amazon\WorkspacesConfig\Logs\MigrationLogs`\. The files that didn't get moved will be located in the `D:\Users\%USERNAME%MMddyyTHHmmss%.NotMigrated` folder\. You can manually move any files that didn't get moved automatically\. 
+ If you are using the API to migrate WorkSpaces and the migration does not succeed, the target WorkSpace ID returned by the API will not be used, and the WorkSpace will still have the original WorkSpace ID\.
+ If a migration does not successfully finish, check the Active Directory to see if it was cleaned up accordingly\. You might need to manually remove WorkSpaces that you no longer need\.

## How Billing Is Affected<a name="migration-billing"></a>

During the month in which migration occurs, you are charged prorated amounts for both the new and the original WorkSpaces\. For example, if you migrate WorkSpace A to WorkSpace B on May 10, you will be charged for WorkSpace A from May 1 to May 10, and you will be charged for WorkSpace B from May 11 to May 30\.

**Note**  
If you are migrating a WorkSpace to a different bundle type \(for example, from Performance to Power, or Value to Standard\), the size of the root volume \(drive C\) and the user volume \(drive D\) might increase during the migration process\. If necessary, the root volume increases to match the default root volume size for the new bundle\. However, if you had already specified a different size \(higher or lower\) for the user volume than the default for the original bundle, that same user volume size is retained during the migration process\. Otherwise, the migration process uses the larger of the source WorkSpace user volume size and the default user volume size for the new bundle\.

## Migrating a WorkSpace<a name="migration-workspaces"></a>

You can migrate WorkSpaces through the Amazon WorkSpaces console, the AWS command line interface \(CLI\), or the Amazon WorkSpaces API\.

**To migrate a WorkSpace**

1. Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/workspaces/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **WorkSpaces**\.

1. Select your WorkSpace and choose **Actions**, **Migrate WorkSpaces**\.

1. Under **Select Target Bundle**, select the bundle that you'd like to migrate your WorkSpace to\.

1. Under **Assign WorkSpace Bundle**, choose the target bundle for each WorkSpace user\.
**Warning**  
For each WorkSpace, take note of the listed snapshot time\. Any changes made to the user volume after the listed snapshot time are discarded during the migration process\.

1. Choose **Migrate WorkSpaces**\.

   A new WorkSpace with a status of `PENDING` appears in the Amazon WorkSpaces console\. When the migration is finished, the original WorkSpace is terminated, and the status of the new WorkSpace is set to `AVAILABLE`\.

1. \(Optional\) To delete any custom bundles and images that you no longer need, see [Delete a Custom WorkSpaces Bundle or Image](delete_bundle.md)\.

To migrate WorkSpaces through the AWS CLI, use the [migrate\-workspace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/workspaces/migrate-workspace.html) command\. To migrate WorkSpaces through the Amazon WorkSpaces API, see [MigrateWorkSpace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_MigrateWorkspace.html) in the *Amazon WorkSpaces API Reference*\.
