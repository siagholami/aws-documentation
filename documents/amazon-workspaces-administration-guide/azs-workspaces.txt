Availability Zones for Amazon WorkSpaces
When you are creating a virtual private cloud (VPC) for use with Amazon WorkSpaces, your VPC's subnets must reside in different Availability Zones in the Region where you're launching WorkSpaces. Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. By launching instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location. Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones.
An Availability Zone is represented by a Region code followed by a letter identifier; for example, us-east-1a. To ensure that resources are distributed across the Availability Zones for a Region, we independently map Availability Zones to names for each AWS account. For example, the Availability Zone us-east-1a for your AWS account might not be the same location as us-east-1a for another AWS account.
To coordinate Availability Zones across accounts, you must use the AZ ID, which is a unique and consistent identifier for an Availability Zone. For example, use1-az2 is an AZ ID for the us-east-1 Region and it has the same location in every AWS account. 
Viewing AZ IDs enables you to determine the location of resources in one account relative to the resources in another account. For example, if you share a subnet in the Availability Zone with the AZ ID use1-az2 with another account, this subnet is available to that account in the Availability Zone whose AZ ID is also use1-az2. The AZ ID for each VPC and subnet is displayed in the Amazon VPC console.
Amazon WorkSpaces is available in a subset of the Availability Zones for each supported Region. The following table lists the AZ IDs that you can use for each Region. To see the mapping of AZ IDs to Availability Zones in your account, see  AZ IDs for Your Resources in the AWS RAM User Guide.
