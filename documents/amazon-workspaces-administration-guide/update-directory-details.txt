Update Directory Details for Your WorkSpaces
You can complete the following directory management tasks using the Amazon WorkSpaces console.
Topics
 Select an Organizational Unit
 Configure Automatic IP Addresses
 Control Device Access
 Manage Local Administrator Permissions
 Update the AD Connector Account (AD Connector)
 Multi-factor Authentication (AD Connector)
Select an Organizational Unit
WorkSpace machine accounts are placed in the default organizational unit (OU) for the WorkSpaces directory. Initially, the machine accounts are placed in the Computers OU of your directory or the directory that your AD Connector is connected to. You can select a different OU from your directory or connected directory, or specify an OU in a separate target domain. Note that you can select only one OU per directory.
After you select a new OU, the machine accounts for all WorkSpaces that are created or rebuilt are placed in the newly selected OU.
To select an organizational unit


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose Directories.


Select your directory and then choose Actions, Update Details.


Expand Target Domain and Organizational Unit.


To find an OU, you can type all or part of the OU name and choose Search OU. Alternatively, you can choose List all OU to list all OUs.


Select the OU and choose Update and Exit.


(Optional) Rebuild the existing WorkSpaces to update the OU. For more information, see Rebuild a WorkSpace.


To specify a target domain and organizational unit


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose Directories.


Select your directory and then choose Actions, Update Details.


Expand Target Domain and Organizational Unit.


For Selected OU, type the full LDAP distinguished name for the target domain and OU and then choose Update and Exit. For example, OU=WorkSpaces_machines,DC=machines,DC=example,DC=com.


(Optional) Rebuild the existing WorkSpaces to update the OU. For more information, see Rebuild a WorkSpace.


Configure Automatic IP Addresses
After you enable automatic assignment of  Elastic IP addresses, each WorkSpace that you launch is assigned an Elastic IP address (a static public IP address) from the Amazon-provided pool of Elastic IP addresses. These Elastic IP addresses allow WorkSpaces in public subnets to access the internet. WorkSpaces that already exist before you enable automatic assignment do not receive an Elastic IP address until you rebuild them.
Note that you do not need to enable automatic assignment of Elastic IP addresses if your WorkSpaces are in private subnets and you configured a NAT gateway for the virtual private cloud (VPC), or if your WorkSpaces are in public subnets and you manually assigned Elastic IP addresses. For more information, see Configure a VPC for Amazon WorkSpaces.
Warning
If you associate an Elastic IP address that you own to a WorkSpace, and then you later disassociate that Elastic IP address from the WorkSpace, the WorkSpace loses its public IP address, and it doesn't automatically get a new one from the Amazon-provided pool. To associate a new public IP address from the Amazon-provided pool with the WorkSpace, you must rebuild the WorkSpace. If you don't want to rebuild the WorkSpace, you must associate another Elastic IP address that you own to the WorkSpace.
To configure Elastic IP addresses


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose Directories.


Select the directory for your WorkSpaces.


Choose Actions, Update Details.


Expand Access to Internet and select Enable or Disable.


Choose Update.


Control Device Access
You can specify the types of devices that have access to WorkSpaces. In addition, you can restrict access to WorkSpaces to trusted devices (also known as managed devices).
To control device access to WorkSpaces


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose Directories.


Select the directory and then choose Actions, Update Details.


Expand Access Control Options and find the Other Platforms section. By default, WorkSpaces Web Access and Linux clients are disabled, and users can access their WorkSpaces from their iOS devices, Android devices, Chromebooks, and PCoIP zero client devices.


Select the device types to enable and clear the device types to disable. To block access from all selected device types, choose Block.


(Optional) You can also restrict access to trusted devices only. For more information, see Restrict WorkSpaces Access to Trusted Devices.


Choose Update and Exit.


Manage Local Administrator Permissions
You can specify whether users are local administrators on their WorkSpaces, which enables them to install application and modify settings on their WorkSpaces. Users are local administrators by default. If you modify this setting, the change applies to all new WorkSpaces that you create and any WorkSpaces that you rebuild.
To modify local administrator permissions


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose Directories.


Select your directory and then choose Actions, Update Details.


Expand Local Administrator Setting.


To ensure that users are local administrators, choose Enable. Otherwise, choose Disable.


Choose Update and Exit.


Update the AD Connector Account (AD Connector)
You can update the AD Connector account that is used to read users and groups and join Amazon WorkSpaces machine accounts to your AD Connector directory.
To update the AD Connector account


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose Directories.


Select your directory and then choose Actions, Update Details.


Expand Update AD Connector Account.


Type the user name and password for the new account.


Choose Update and Exit.


Multi-factor Authentication (AD Connector)
You can enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your AD Connector directory.
Note
Your RADIUS server can either be hosted by AWS or it can be on-premises.
The usernames must match between Active Directory and your RADIUS server. 
To enable multi-factor authentication


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose Directories.


Select your directory and then choose Actions, Update Details.


Expand Multi-Factor Authentication and then select Enable Multi-Factor Authentication.


For RADIUS server IP address(es), type the IP addresses of your RADIUS server endpoints separated by commas, or type the IP address of your RADIUS server load balancer.


For Port, type the port that your RADIUS server is using for communications. Your on-premises network must allow inbound traffic over the default RADIUS server port (1812) from AD Connector.


For Shared secret code and Confirm shared secret code, type the shared secret code for your RADIUS server.


For Protocol, choose the protocol for your RADIUS server.


For Server timeout, type the time, in seconds, to wait for the RADIUS server to respond. This value must be between 1 and 20.


For Max retries, type the number of times to attempt communication with the RADIUS server. This value must be between 0 and 10.


Choose Update and Exit.


Multi-factor authentication is available when RADIUS status is Enabled. While multi-factor authentication is being set up, users cannot log in to their WorkSpaces.
