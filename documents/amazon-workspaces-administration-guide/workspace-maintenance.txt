WorkSpace Maintenance
We recommend that you maintain your WorkSpaces on a regular basis. Amazon WorkSpaces schedules default maintenance windows for your WorkSpaces. During the maintenance window, the WorkSpace installs important updates from Amazon WorkSpaces and reboots as necessary. If available, operating system updates are also installed from the OS update server that the WorkSpace is configured to use. During maintenance, your WorkSpaces might be unavailable.
Note
By default, your Windows WorkSpaces are configured to receive updates from Windows Update. To configure your own automatic update mechanisms for Windows, see the documentation for  Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and Configuration Manager.
Maintenance Windows for AlwaysOn WorkSpaces
For AlwaysOn WorkSpaces, the maintenance window is determined by operating system settings. The default is a four-hour period from 00h00 to 04h00, in the time zone of the WorkSpace, each Sunday morning. By default, the time zone of an AlwaysOn WorkSpace is the time zone of the AWS Region for the WorkSpace. However, if you connect from another Region and time zone redirection is enabled, and then you disconnect, the time zone of the WorkSpace is updated to the time zone of the Region that you connected from.
You can disable time zone redirection for Windows WorkSpaces using Group Policy. You cannot disable time zone redirection for Linux WorkSpaces.
For Windows WorkSpaces, you can configure the maintenance window using Group Policy; see Configure Group Policy Settings for Automatic Updates. You cannot configure the maintenance window for Linux WorkSpaces.
Maintenance Windows for AutoStop WorkSpaces
AutoStop WorkSpaces are started automatically once a month in order to install important updates. Beginning on the third Monday of the month, and for up to two weeks, the maintenance window is open each day from about 00h00 to 05h00, in the time zone of the AWS Region for the WorkSpace. The WorkSpace can be maintained on any one day in the maintenance window.
During the time period when the WorkSpace is undergoing maintenance, the state of the WorkSpace is set to MAINTENANCE.
Although you cannot modify the time zone that is used for maintaining AutoStop WorkSpaces, you can disable the maintenance window for your AutoStop WorkSpaces as follows. If you disable maintenance mode, your WorkSpaces are not rebooted and do not enter the MAINTENANCE state.
To disable maintenance mode


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose Directories.


Select your directory, and choose Actions, Update Details.


Expand Maintenance Mode.


To enable automatic updates, choose Enabled. If you prefer to manage updates manually, choose Disabled.


Choose Update and Exit.


Manual Maintenance
If you prefer, you can maintain your WorkSpaces on your own schedule. When you perform maintenance tasks, we recommend that you change the state of the WorkSpace to ADMIN_MAINTENANCE. When you are finished, change the state of the WorkSpace to AVAILABLE.
When a WorkSpace is in ADMIN_MAINTENANCE mode, the following behaviors occur:
 The WorkSpace does not respond to requests to reboot, stop, start, or rebuild.
 Users cannot log in to the WorkSpace.
 An AutoStop WorkSpace is not hibernated.
To change the state of the WorkSpace using the console
Note
To change the state of a WorkSpace, the WorkSpace must have a status of AVAILABLE. The Modify State setting is not available when a WorkSpace has a status of STOPPED.


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose WorkSpaces.


Select your WorkSpace, and choose Actions, Modify WorkSpace.


Choose Modify State. For Intended State, select ADMIN_MAINTENANCE or AVAILABLE.


Choose Modify.
