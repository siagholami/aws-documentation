Manage the WorkSpace Running Mode
The running mode of a WorkSpace determines its immediate availability and how you pay for it. You can choose between the following running modes when you create the WorkSpace:
 AlwaysOn — Use when paying a fixed monthly fee for unlimited usage of your WorkSpaces. This mode is best for users who use their WorkSpace full time as their primary desktop.
 AutoStop — Use when paying for your WorkSpaces by the hour. With this mode, your WorkSpaces stop after a specified period of disconnection, and the state of apps and data is saved. To set the automatic stop time, use AutoStop Time (hours).
When possible, the state of the desktop is saved to the root volume of the WorkSpace. The WorkSpace resumes when a user logs in, and all open documents and running programs return to their saved state.
For more information, see Amazon WorkSpaces Pricing.
Modify the Running Mode
You can switch between running modes at any time.
To modify the running mode of a WorkSpace


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose WorkSpaces.


Select the WorkSpace to modify and choose Actions, Modify Running Mode Properties.


Select the new running mode, AlwaysOn or AutoStop, and then choose Modify.


Stop and Start an AutoStop WorkSpace
When your AutoStop WorkSpaces are disconnected, they are automatically stopped after a specified period of disconnection, and hourly metering is suspended. To further optimize costs, you can suspend the hourly charges associated with AutoStop WorkSpaces. The WorkSpace is stopped and all apps and data are saved for the next time a user logs in to the WorkSpace.
Note
Amazon WorkSpaces can detect disconnection only when users are using Amazon WorkSpaces clients. If users are using third-party clients, Amazon WorkSpaces might not be able to detect disconnection, and therefore the WorkSpace might not automatically stop and metering might not be suspended.
When a user reconnects to a stopped WorkSpace, it resumes from where it left off, typically in under 90 seconds.
You can restart AutoStop WorkSpaces that are available or in an error state.
To stop an AutoStop WorkSpace


Open the Amazon WorkSpaces console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/.


In the navigation pane, choose WorkSpaces.


Select the WorkSpace to be stopped and choose Actions, Stop WorkSpaces.


When prompted for confirmation, choose Stop.


To start an AutoStop WorkSpace
