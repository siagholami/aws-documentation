# Sources for Data Migration<a name="CHAP_Source"></a>

AWS Database Migration Service \(AWS DMS\) can use many of the most popular data engines as a source for data replication\. The database source can be a self\-managed engine running on anÂ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instance or an on\-premises database\. Or it can be a data source on an Amazon\-managed service such as Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) or Amazon S3\.

Valid sources for AWS DMS include the following:

**On\-premises and Amazon EC2 instance databases**
+ Oracle versions 10\.2 and later, 11g, and up to 12\.2, for the Enterprise, Standard, Standard One, and Standard Two editions\.
+ Microsoft SQL Server versions 2005, 2008, 2008R2, 2012, 2014, and 2016 for the Enterprise, Standard, Workgroup, and Developer editions\. The Web and Express editions are not supported\.
+ MySQL versions 5\.5, 5\.6, and 5\.7\.
+ MariaDB \(supported as a MySQL\-compatible data source\)\.
+ PostgreSQL 9\.4 and later\.
+ SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise \(ASE\) versions 12\.5\.3 or higher, 15, 15\.5, 15\.7, 16 and later\.
+ MongoDB versions 2\.6\.x and 3\.x and later\.
+ Db2 LUW versions:
  + Version 9\.7, all Fix Packs are supported\.
  + Version 10\.1, all Fix Packs are supported\.
  + Version 10\.5, all Fix Packs except for Fix Pack 5 are supported\.

**Microsoft Azure**
+ AWS DMS supports full data load when using Azure SQL Database as a source\. Change data capture \(CDC\) is not supported\. 

**Amazon RDS instance databases**
+ Oracle versions 11g \(versions 11\.2\.0\.3\.v1 and later\), and 12c, for the Enterprise, Standard, Standard One, and Standard Two editions\.
+ Microsoft SQL Server versions 2008R2, 2012, 2014, and 2016 for both the Enterprise and Standard editions\. CDC is supported for all versions of Enterprise Edition\. CDC is only supported for Standard Edition version 2016 SP1 and later\. The Web, Workgroup, Developer, and Express editions are not supported by AWS DMS\.
+ MySQL versions 5\.5, 5\.6, and 5\.7\. Change data capture \(CDC\) is only supported for versions 5\.6 and later\.
+ PostgreSQL 9\.4 and later\. CDC is only supported for versions 9\.4\.9 and higher and 9\.5\.4 and higher\. The `rds.logical_replication` parameter, which is required for CDC, is supported only in these versions and later\.

+ Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility\.

**Amazon S3**
+ AWS DMS supports full data load and change data capture \(CDC\) when using Amazon S3 as a source\.
