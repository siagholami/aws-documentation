# Data Validation Task Settings<a name="CHAP_Tasks.CustomizingTasks.TaskSettings.DataValidation"></a>

You can ensure that your data was migrated accurately from the source to the target\. If you enable it for a task, then AWS DMS begins comparing the source and target data immediately after a full load is performed for a table\. For more information on data validation, see [Validating AWS DMS Tasks](CHAP_Validating.md)\.

 Data validation settings include the following:
+ To enable data validation, set the `EnableValidation` setting to `true`\.
+ To adjust the number of execution threads that AWS DMS uses during validation, set the `ThreadCount` value\. The default value for `ThreadCount` is 5\. If you set `ThreadCount` to a higher number, AWS DMS will be able to complete the validation fasterâ€”however, it will also execute more simultaneous queries, consuming more resources on the source and the target\.

For example, the following JSON enables data validation:

```
"ValidationSettings": {
     "EnableValidation": true,
     "ThreadCount": 5
  }
```

 For an Oracle endpoint, AWS DMS uses DBMS\_CRYPTO to validate BLOBs\. If your Oracle endpoint uses BLOBs, then you must grant the execute permission on dbms\_crypto to the user account that is used to access the Oracle endpoint\. You can do this by running the following statement:

```
grant execute on sys.dbms_crypto to <dms_endpoint_user>;
```
