# Targets for Data Migration<a name="CHAP_Target"></a>

AWS Database Migration Service \(AWS DMS\) can use many of the most popular databases as a target for data replication\. The target can be on anÂ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instance, an Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) instance, or an on\-premises database\. 

**Note**  
Regardless of the source storage engine \(MyISAM, MEMORY, and so on\), AWS DMS creates a MySQL\-compatible target table as an InnoDB table by default\. If you need to have a table that uses a storage engine other than InnoDB, you can manually create the table on the MySQL\-compatible target and migrate the table using the "do nothing" mode\. For more information about the "do nothing" mode, see [Full Load Task Settings](CHAP_Tasks.CustomizingTasks.TaskSettings.FullLoad.md)\.

The databases include the following: 

**On\-premises and EC2 instance databases**
+ Oracle versions 10g, 11g, 12c, for the Enterprise, Standard, Standard One, and Standard Two editions
+ Microsoft SQL Server versions 2005, 2008, 2008R2, 2012, 2014, and 2016, for the Enterprise, Standard, Workgroup, and Developer editions\. The Web and Express editions are not supported\.

+ MariaDB \(supported as a MySQL\-compatible data target\)
+ PostgreSQL versions 9\.4 and later
