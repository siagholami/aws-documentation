Step 4: Create an IAM Policy for Notebook Servers
If you plan to use notebooks with development endpoints, you must specify permissions when you create the notebook server. You provide those permissions by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
This policy grants permission for some Amazon S3 actions to manage resources in your account that are needed by AWS Glue when it assumes the role using this policy. Some of the resources that are specified in this policy refer to default names used by AWS Glue for Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon S3 ETL scripts, and Amazon EC2 resources. For simplicity, AWS Glue defaults writing some Amazon S3 objects into buckets in your account prefixed with aws-glue-*. 
Note
You can skip this step if you use the AWS managed policy AWSGlueServiceNotebookRole.
In this step, you create a policy that is similar to AWSGlueServiceNotebookRole. You can find the most current version of AWSGlueServiceNotebookRole on the IAM console.
To create an IAM policy for notebooks


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Policies.


Choose Create Policy.


On the Create Policy screen, navigate to a tab to edit JSON. Create a policy document with the following JSON statements, and then choose Review policy.
