Connection API
The Connection API describes AWS Glue connection data types, and the API for creating, deleting, updating, and listing connections.

GetConnectionsFilter Structure

Connection Structure
Defines a connection to a data source.
Fields
 Name – UTF-8 string, not less than 1 or more than 255 bytes long, matching the Single-line string pattern.
The name of the connection definition.
 Description – Description string, not more than 2048 bytes long, matching the URI address multi-line string pattern.
The description of the connection.
 ConnectionType – UTF-8 string (valid values: JDBC | SFTP).
The type of the connection. Currently, only JDBC is supported; SFTP is not supported.
 MatchCriteria – An array of UTF-8 strings, not more than 10 strings.
A list of criteria that can be used in selecting this connection.
 ConnectionProperties – A map array of key-value pairs, not more than 100 pairs.
Each key is a UTF-8 string (valid values: HOST | PORT | USERNAME="USER_NAME" | PASSWORD | ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD | JDBC_DRIVER_JAR_URI | JDBC_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME | JDBC_ENGINE | JDBC_ENGINE_VERSION | CONFIG_FILES | INSTANCE_ID | JDBC_CONNECTION_URL | JDBC_ENFORCE_SSL | CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT | SKIP_CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_VALIDATION | CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_STRING).
Each value is a Value string, not more than 1024 bytes long.
These key-value pairs define parameters for the connection:
   HOST - The host URI: either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the IPv4 address of the database host.
   PORT - The port number, between 1024 and 65535, of the port on which the database host is listening for database connections.
   USER_NAME - The name under which to log in to the database. The value string for USER_NAME is "USERNAME".
   PASSWORD - A password, if one is used, for the user name.
   ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD - When you enable connection password protection by setting ConnectionPasswordEncryption in the Data Catalog encryption settings, this field stores the encrypted password.
   JDBC_DRIVER_JAR_URI - The Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) path of the JAR file that contains the JDBC driver to use.
   JDBC_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME - The class name of the JDBC driver to use.
   JDBC_ENGINE - The name of the JDBC engine to use.
   JDBC_ENGINE_VERSION - The version of the JDBC engine to use.
   CONFIG_FILES - (Reserved for future use.)
   INSTANCE_ID - The instance ID to use.
   JDBC_CONNECTION_URL - The URL for the JDBC connection.
   JDBC_ENFORCE_SSL - A Boolean string (true, false) specifying whether Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with hostname matching is enforced for the JDBC connection on the client. The default is false.
   CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT - An Amazon S3 location specifying the customer's root certificate. AWS Glue uses this root certificate to validate the customer's certificate when connecting to the customer database. AWS Glue only handles X.509 certificates. The certificate provided must be DER-encoded and supplied in Base64 encoding PEM format.
   SKIP_CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_VALIDATION - By default, this is false. AWS Glue validates the Signature algorithm and Subject Public Key Algorithm for the customer certificate. The only permitted algorithms for the Signature algorithm are SHA256withRSA, SHA384withRSA or SHA512withRSA. For the Subject Public Key Algorithm, the key length must be at least 2048. You can set the value of this property to true to skip AWS Glue's validation of the customer certificate.
   CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_STRING - A custom JDBC certificate string which is used for domain match or distinguished name match to prevent a man-in-the-middle attack. In Oracle database, this is used as the SSL_SERVER_CERT_DN; in Microsoft SQL Server, this is used as the hostNameInCertificate.
 PhysicalConnectionRequirements – A PhysicalConnectionRequirements object.
A map of physical connection requirements, such as virtual private cloud (VPC) and SecurityGroup, that are needed to make this connection successfully.
 CreationTime – Timestamp.
The time that this connection definition was created.
 LastUpdatedTime – Timestamp.
The last time that this connection definition was updated.
 LastUpdatedBy – UTF-8 string, not less than 1 or more than 255 bytes long, matching the Single-line string pattern.
The user, group, or role that last updated this connection definition.
ConnectionInput Structure
A structure that is used to specify a connection to create or update.
Fields
 Name – Required: UTF-8 string, not less than 1 or more than 255 bytes long, matching the Single-line string pattern.
The name of the connection.
 Description – Description string, not more than 2048 bytes long, matching the URI address multi-line string pattern.
The description of the connection.
 ConnectionType – Required: UTF-8 string (valid values: JDBC | SFTP).
The type of the connection. Currently, only JDBC is supported; SFTP is not supported.
 MatchCriteria – An array of UTF-8 strings, not more than 10 strings.
A list of criteria that can be used in selecting this connection.
 ConnectionProperties – Required: A map array of key-value pairs, not more than 100 pairs.
Each key is a UTF-8 string (valid values: HOST | PORT | USERNAME="USER_NAME" | PASSWORD | ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD | JDBC_DRIVER_JAR_URI | JDBC_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME | JDBC_ENGINE | JDBC_ENGINE_VERSION | CONFIG_FILES | INSTANCE_ID | JDBC_CONNECTION_URL | JDBC_ENFORCE_SSL | CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT | SKIP_CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_VALIDATION | CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_STRING).
Each value is a Value string, not more than 1024 bytes long.
These key-value pairs define parameters for the connection.
 PhysicalConnectionRequirements – A PhysicalConnectionRequirements object.
A map of physical connection requirements, such as virtual private cloud (VPC) and SecurityGroup, that are needed to successfully make this connection.
PhysicalConnectionRequirements Structure
Specifies the physical requirements for a connection.
Fields
 SubnetId – UTF-8 string, not less than 1 or more than 255 bytes long, matching the Single-line string pattern.
The subnet ID used by the connection.
 SecurityGroupIdList – An array of UTF-8 strings, not more than 50 strings.
The security group ID list used by the connection.
 AvailabilityZone – UTF-8 string, not less than 1 or more than 255 bytes long, matching the Single-line string pattern.
The connection's Availability Zone. This field is redundant because the specified subnet implies the Availability Zone to be used. Currently the field must be populated, but it will be deprecated in the future.
GetConnectionsFilter Structure
Filters the connection definitions that are returned by the GetConnections API operation.
Fields
 MatchCriteria – An array of UTF-8 strings, not more than 10 strings.
A criteria string that must match the criteria recorded in the connection definition for that connection definition to be returned.
 ConnectionType – UTF-8 string (valid values: JDBC | SFTP).
The type of connections to return. Currently, only JDBC is supported; SFTP is not supported.
