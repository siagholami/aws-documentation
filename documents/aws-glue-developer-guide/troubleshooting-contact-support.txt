Gathering AWS Glue Troubleshooting Information
If you encounter errors or unexpected behavior in AWS Glue and need to contact AWS Support, you should first gather information about names, IDs, and logs that are associated with the failed action. Having this information available enables AWS Support to help you resolve the problems you're experiencing. 
Along with your account ID, gather the following information for each of these types of failures:
