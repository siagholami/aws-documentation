Working with Classifiers on the AWS Glue Console
A classifier determines the schema of your data. You can write a custom classifier and point to it from AWS Glue. To see a list of all the classifiers that you have created, open the AWS Glue console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/, and choose the Classifiers tab.
The list displays the following properties about each classifier:
Classifier
The classifier name. When you create a classifier, you must provide a name for it.
Classification
The classification type of tables inferred by this classifier.
Last updated
The last time this classifier was updated.
From the Classifiers list in the AWS Glue console, you can add, edit, and delete classifiers. To see more details for a classifier, choose the classifier name in the list. Details include the information you defined when you created the classifier.  
To add a classifier in the AWS Glue console, choose Add classifier. When you define a classifier, you supply values for the following:
Classifier name
Provide a unique name for your classifier.
Classification
For grok classifiers, describe the format or type of data that is classified or provide a custom label.
Grok pattern
For grok classifiers, this is used to parse your data into a structured schema. The grok pattern is composed of named patterns that describe the format of your data store. You write this grok pattern using the named built-in patterns provided by AWS Glue and custom patterns you write and include in the Custom patterns field. Although grok debugger results might not match the results from AWS Glue exactly, we suggest that you try your pattern using some sample data with a grok debugger. You can find grok debuggers on the web. The named built-in patterns provided by AWS Glue are generally compatible with grok patterns that are available on the web. 
Build your grok pattern by iteratively adding named patterns and check your results in a debugger. This activity gives you confidence that when the AWS Glue crawler runs your grok pattern, your data can be parsed.
Custom patterns
For grok classifiers, these are optional building blocks for the Grok pattern that you write. When built-in patterns cannot parse your data, you might need to write a custom pattern. These custom patterns are defined in this field and referenced in the Grok pattern field. Each custom pattern is defined on a separate line. Just like the built-in patterns, it consists of a named pattern definition that uses regular expression (regex) syntax. 
For example, the following has the name MESSAGEPREFIX followed by a regular expression definition to apply to your data to determine whether it follows the pattern.   
MESSAGEPREFIX .*-.*-.*-.*-.*
Row tag
For XML classifiers, this is the name of the XML tag that defines a table row in the XML document. Type the name without angle brackets < >. The name must comply with XML rules for a tag.
JSON path
For JSON classifiers, this is the JSON path to the object, array, or value that defines a row of the table being created. Type the name in either dot or bracket JSON syntax using AWS Glue supported operators. For more information, see the list of operators in Writing JSON Custom Classifiers.
