Key Management
You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) with AWS Glue to define users, AWS resources, groups, roles and fine-grained policies regarding access, denial, and more.
You can define the access to the metadata using both resource-based and identity-based policies, depending on your organizationâ€™s needs. Resource-based policies list the principals that are allowed or denied access to your resources, allowing you to set up policies such as cross-account access. Identity policies are specifically attached to users, groups, and roles within IAM. 
For a step-by-step example, see Restrict access to your AWS Glue Data Catalog with resource-level IAM permissions and resource-based policies on the AWS Big Data Blog.
The fine-grained access portion of the policy is defined within the Resource clause. This portion defines both the AWS Glue Data Catalog object that the action can be performed on, and what resulting objects get returned by that operation. 
A development endpoint is an environment that you can use to develop and test your AWS Glue scripts. You can add, delete, or rotate the SSH key of a development endpoint. 
As of September 4, 2018, AWS KMS (bring your own key and server-side encryption) for AWS Glue ETL and the AWS Glue Data Catalog is supported.
