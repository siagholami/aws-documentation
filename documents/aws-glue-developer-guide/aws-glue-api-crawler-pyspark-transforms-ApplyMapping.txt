__call__(frame, mappings, transformation_ctx = "", info = "", stageThreshold = 0, totalThreshold = 0)
Applies a declarative mapping to a specified DynamicFrame.
 frame – The DynamicFrame in which to apply the mapping (required).
 mappings – A list of mapping tuples, each consisting of: (source column, source type, target column, target type). Required.
If the source column has dots in it, the mapping will not work unless you place back-ticks around it (```\)\. For example, to mapthis.old.name\(string\) tothisNewName` (string), you would use the following tuple:
("`this.old.name`", "string", "thisNewName", "string")
 transformation_ctx – A unique string that is used to identify state information (optional).
 info – A string associated with errors in the transformation (optional).
 stageThreshold – The maximum number of errors that can occur in the transformation before it errors out (optional; the default is zero).
 totalThreshold – The maximum number of errors that can occur overall before processing errors out (optional; the default is zero).
Returns only the fields of the DynamicFrame specified in the "mapping" tuples.
