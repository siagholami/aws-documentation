# Tutorial Setup: Prerequisites for the Development Endpoint Tutorials<a name="dev-endpoint-tutorial-prerequisites"></a>

Development endpoints create an environment where you can interactively test and debug ETL scripts in various ways before you run them as AWS Glue jobs\. The tutorials in this section show you how to do this using different IDEs\. All of them assume that you have set up a development endpoint and crawled sample data to create tables in your AWS Glue Data Catalog using the steps in the following sections\.

Because you're using only Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) data in some cases, and a mix of JDBC and Amazon S3 data in others, you will set up one development endpoint that is not in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) and one that is\.

## Crawling the Sample Data Used in the Tutorials<a name="dev-endpoint-tutorial-prerequisites-crawl-data"></a>

The first step is to create a crawler that can crawl some sample data and record metadata about it in tables in your Data Catalog\. The sample data that is used is drawn from [http://everypolitician\.org/](http://everypolitician.org/) and has been modified slightly for purposes of the tutorials\. It contains data in JSON format about United States legislators and the seats that they have held in the US House of Representatives and Senate\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Glue console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/glue/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/)\.

   In the AWS Glue console, choose **Databases** in the navigation pane, and then choose **Add database**\. Name the database `legislators`\.

1. Choose **Crawlers**, and then choose **Add crawler**\. Name the crawler `legislator_crawler`, and then choose **Next**\.

1. Accept the default crawler source type \(**Data stores**\) and click **Next**\.

1. Leave **S3** as the data store\. Under **Crawl data in**, choose **Specified path in another account**\. Then in the **Include path** box, enter **s3://awsglue\-datasets/examples/us\-legislators/all**\. Choose **Next**, and then choose **Next** again to confirm that you don't want to add another data store\. 

1. Provide an IAM role for the crawler to assume when it runs\.

   Provide a role that can access `s3://awsglue-datasets/examples/us-legislators/all`, or choose **Create an IAM role** and enter a name to create a role that has access to that location\.

1. Choose **Next**, and then choose **Next** again to confirm that this crawler will be run on demand\.

1. For **Database**, choose the `legislators` database\. Choose **Next**, and then choose **Finish** to complete the creation of the new crawler\.

1. Choose **Crawlers** in the navigation pane again\. Select the check box next to the new `legislator_crawler` crawler, and choose **Run crawler**\.

1. Choose **Databases** in the navigation pane\. Choose the `legislators` database, and then choose **Tables in legislators**\. You should see six tables created by the crawler in your Data Catalog, containing metadata that the crawler retrieved\.

## Creating a Development Endpoint for Amazon S3 Data<a name="dev-endpoint-tutorial-prerequisites-no-vpc-devendpoint"></a>

The next thing to do is to create a development endpoint for Amazon S3 data\. When you use a JDBC data source or target, the development endpoint must be created with a VPC\. However, this isn't necessary in this tutorial if you are only accessing Amazon S3\.

1. In the AWS Glue console, choose **Dev endpoints**\. Choose **Add endpoint**\.

1. Specify an endpoint name, such as **demo\-endpoint**\.

1. Choose an **IAM role** with permissions similar to the IAM role that you use to run AWS Glue ETL jobs\. For more information, see [Step 2: Create an IAM Role for AWS Glue](create-an-iam-role.md)\. Choose **Next**\.

1. In **Networking**, leave **Skip networking information** selected, and choose **Next**\.

1. In **SSH Public Key**, enter a public key generated by an SSH key generator program, such as **ssh\-keygen** \(do not use an Amazon EC2 key pair\)\. The generated public key will be imported into your development endpoint\. Save the corresponding private key to later connect to the development endpoint using SSH\. Choose **Next**\. For more information, see [ssh\-keygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen) in Wikipedia\.
**Note**  
When generating the key on Microsoft Windows, use a current version of PuTTYgen and paste the public key into the AWS Glue console from the PuTTYgen window\. Generate an **RSA** key\. Do not upload a file with the public key, instead use the key generated in the field **Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized\_keys file**\. The corresponding private key \(\.ppk\) can be used in PuTTY to connect to the development endpoint\. To connect to the development endpoint with SSH on Windows, convert the private key from `.ppk` format to OpenSSH `.pem` format using the PuTTYgen **Conversion** menu\. For more information, see [Connecting to Your Linux Instance from Windows Using PuTTY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html)\.

1. In **Review**, choose **Finish**\. After the development endpoint is created, wait for its provisioning status to move to **READY**\.

## Creating an Amazon S3 Location to Use for Output<a name="dev-endpoint-tutorial-prerequisites-s3-bucket"></a>

If you don't already have a bucket, follow the instructions in [Create a Bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) to set one up in Amazon S3 where you can save output from sample ETL scripts\.

## Creating a Development Endpoint with a VPC<a name="dev-endpoint-tutorial-prerequisites-vpc-devendpoint"></a>

Although not required for this tutorial, a VPC development endpoint is needed if both Amazon S3 and JDBC data stores are accessed by your ETL statements\. In this case, when you create a development endpoint you specify network properties of the virtual private cloud \(Amazon VPC\) that contains your JDBC data stores\. Before you start, set up your environment as explained in [Setting Up Your Environment for Development Endpoints](start-development-endpoint.md)\. 

1. In the AWS Glue console, choose **Dev endpoints** in the navigation pane\. Then choose **Add endpoint**\.

1. Specify an endpoint name, such as **vpc\-demo\-endpoint**\.

1. Choose an **IAM role** with permissions similar to the IAM role that you use to run AWS Glue ETL jobs\. For more information, see [Step 2: Create an IAM Role for AWS Glue](create-an-iam-role.md)\. Choose **Next**\.

1. In **Networking**, specify an Amazon VPC, a subnet, and security groups\. This information is used to create a development endpoint that can connect to your data resources securely\. Consider the following suggestions when filling in the properties of your endpoint:
   + If you already set up a connection to your data stores, you can use the same connection to determine the Amazon VPC, subnet, and security groups for your endpoint\. Otherwise, specify these parameters individually\.
   + Ensure that your Amazon VPC has **Edit DNS hostnames** set to **yes**\. This parameter can be set in the Amazon VPC console \([https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\)\. For more information, see [Setting Up DNS in Your VPC](set-up-vpc-dns.md)\.
   + For this tutorial, ensure that the Amazon VPC you select has an Amazon S3 VPC endpoint\. For information about how to create an Amazon S3 VPC endpoint, see [Amazon VPC Endpoints for Amazon S3](vpc-endpoints-s3.md)\.
   + Choose a public subnet for your development endpoint\. You can make a subnet a public subnet by adding a route to an internet gateway\. For IPv4 traffic, create a route with **Destination** `0.0.0.0/0` and **Target** the internet gateway ID\. Your subnetâ€™s route table should be associated with an internet gateway, not a NAT gateway\. This information can be set in the Amazon VPC console \([https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\)\. For example:  
![\[An example of a route table with an internet gateway.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/images/AuthorJob-InternetGatewayRouteTable.png)

     For more information, see [Route tables for Internet Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#route-tables-internet-gateway)\. For information about how to create an internet gateway, see [Internet Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html)\.
   + Ensure that you choose a security group that has an inbound self\-reference rule\. This information can be set in the Amazon VPC console \([https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\)\. For example:  
![\[An example of a self-referencing inbound rule.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/images/SetupSecurityGroup-Start.png)

     For more information about how to set up your subnet, see [Setting Up Your Environment for Development Endpoints](start-development-endpoint.md)\.

   Choose **Next**\.

1. In **SSH Public Key**, enter a public key generated by an SSH key generator program \(do not use an Amazon EC2 key pair\)\. Save the corresponding private key to later connect to the development endpoint using SSH\. Choose **Next**\.
**Note**  
When generating the key on Microsoft Windows, use a current version of PuTTYgen and paste the public key into the AWS Glue console from the PuTTYgen window\. Generate an **RSA** key\. Do not upload a file with the public key, instead use the key generated in the field **Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized\_keys file**\. The corresponding private key \(\.ppk\) can be used in PuTTY to connect to the development endpoint\. To connect to the development endpoint with SSH on Windows, convert the private key from `.ppk` format to OpenSSH `.pem` format using the PuTTYgen **Conversion** menu\. For more information, see [Connecting to Your Linux Instance from Windows Using PuTTY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html)\.

1. In **Review**, choose **Finish**\. After the development endpoint is created, wait for its provisioning status to move to **READY**\.
