__call__(frame, old_name, new_name, transformation_ctx = "", info = "", stageThreshold = 0, totalThreshold = 0)
Renames a node within a DynamicFrame.
 frame – The DynamicFrame in which to rename a node (required).
 old_name – Full path to the node to rename (required).
If the old name has dots in it, RenameField will not work unless you place back-ticks around it (```\)\. For example, to replacethis.old.namewiththisNewName`, you would call RenameField as follows:
newDyF = RenameField(oldDyF, "`this.old.name`", "thisNewName")
 new_name – New name, including full path (required).
 transformation_ctx – A unique string that is used to identify state information (optional).
 info – A string associated with errors in the transformation (optional).
 stageThreshold – The maximum number of errors that can occur in the transformation before it errors out (optional; the default is zero).
 totalThreshold – The maximum number of errors that can occur overall before processing errors out (optional; the default is zero).
Returns a DynamicFrame with the specified field renamed.
