Amazon EKS compute
Your Amazon EKS cluster can schedule pods on any combination of Self-managed nodes, Amazon EKS Managed node groups, and AWS Fargate. The following table provides several criteria to evaluate when deciding which options best meets your requirements. We recommend reviewing this page often because the data in this table changes frequently as new capabilities are introduced to Amazon EKS.



Criteria
EKS managed node groups
Self-managed nodes
AWS Fargate




Can run containers that require Windows
No
Yes – Your cluster still requires at least one (two recommended for availability) Linux node though.
No


Can run containers that require Linux
Yes
Yes
Yes


Can run workloads that require the Inferentia chip
No
Yes – Amazon Linux only
No


Can run workloads that require a GPU
Yes – Amazon Linux nodes only
Yes – Amazon Linux only
No


Can run workloads that require Arm processors
Yes
Yes
No


Can run AWS Bottlerocket
No
Yes
No – There is no node.


Pods share a kernel runtime environment with other pods
Yes – All of your pods on each of your nodes
Yes – All of your pods on each of your nodes
No – Each pod has a dedicated kernel


Pods share CPU, memory, storage, and network resources with other pods.
Yes – Can result in unused resources on each node
Yes – Can result in unused resources on each node
No – Each pod has dedicated resources and can be sized independently to maximize resource utilization.


Pods can use more hardware and memory than requested in pod specs
Yes – If the pod requires more resources than requested, and resources are available on the node, the pod can use additional resources.
Yes – If the pod requires more resources than requested, and resources are available on the node, the pod can use additional resources.
No – The pod can be re-deployed using a larger vCPU and memory configuration though.


Must deploy and manage Amazon EC2 instances
Yes – automated through Amazon EKS if you deployed an Amazon EKS optimized AMI. If you deployed a custom AMI, then you must update the instance manually.
Yes – Manual configuration or using Amazon EKS provided AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy Linux (x86), Linux (Arm), or Windows nodes.
No


Must secure, maintain, and patch the operating system of Amazon EC2 instances
Yes
Yes
No


Can provide bootstrap arguments at deployment of a node, such as extra kubelet arguments.
Yes – Using a launch template with a custom AMI
Yes – For more information, view the bootstrap script usage information on GitHub.
No – There is no node.


Can assign IP addresses to pods from a different CIDR block than the IP address assigned to the node.
Yes – Using a launch template with a custom AMI
Yes, using CNI custom networking.
No – There is no node.


Can SSH into node
Yes
Yes
No – There is no node host operating system to SSH to.


Can deploy your own custom AMI to nodes
Yes – Using a launch template
Yes
No – You don't manage nodes.


Can deploy your own custom CNI to nodes
Yes – Using a launch template with a custom AMI
Yes
No – You don't manage nodes.


Must update node AMI yourself
Yes – If you deployed an Amazon EKS optimized AMI, then you're notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available and can perform the update with one click in the console. If you deployed a custom AMI, then you're not notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available and must perform the update yourself.
Yes  - Using tools other than the Amazon EKS console, because self-managed nodes can't be managed with the Amazon EKS console.
No – You don't manage nodes.


Must update node Kubernetes version yourself
Yes – If you deployed an Amazon EKS optimized AMI, then you're notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available and can perform the update with one click in the console. If you deployed a custom AMI, then you're not notified in the Amazon EKS console when updates are available and must perform the update yourself.
Yes  – Using tools other than the Amazon EKS console, because self-managed nodes can't be managed with the Amazon EKS console.
No – You don't manage nodes.


Can use Amazon EBS storage with pods
Yes
Yes
No


Can use Amazon EFS storage with pods
Yes
Yes
Yes


Can use Amazon FSx for Lustre storage with pods
Yes
Yes
No


Can use Network Load Balancer for services
Yes
Yes
No


Pods can run in a public subnet
Yes
Yes
No


Can assign different VPC security groups to individual pods
Yes – Linux nodes only
Yes – Linux nodes only
No


Can run Kubernetes DaemonSets
Yes
Yes
No


Support HostPort and HostNetwork in the pod manifest
Yes
Yes
No
