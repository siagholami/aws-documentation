Launching self-managed Windows nodes
This topic helps you to launch an Auto Scaling group of Windows nodes that register with your Amazon EKS cluster. After the nodes join the cluster, you can deploy Kubernetes applications to them.
Important
Amazon EKS nodes are standard Amazon EC2 instances, and you are billed for them based on normal Amazon EC2 instance prices. For more information, see Amazon EC2 pricing.
You must enable Windows support for your cluster and we recommend that you review important considerations before you launch a Windows node group. For more information, see Enabling Windows support. 
You can launch self-managed Windows nodes with eksctl or the AWS Management Console.
To launch self-managed Windows nodes using eksctl
This procedure assumes that you have installed eksctl, and that your eksctl version is at least 0.28.0. You can check your version with the following command:
eksctl version
For more information on installing or upgrading eksctl, see Installing or upgrading eksctl.
Note
This procedure only works for clusters that were created with eksctl.

This procedure assumes that you have an existing cluster named my-cluster in the us-west-2 Region. For a different existing cluster, change the values. If you don't already have an Amazon EKS cluster and an Amazon Linux 2 node group to add a Windows node group to, then we recommend that you follow the Getting started with eksctl guide instead. The guide provides a complete end-to-end walkthrough for creating an Amazon EKS cluster with Amazon Linux and Windows nodes.

Create your node group with the following command. Replace the example values with your own values.
eksctl create nodegroup \
   --region us-west-2 \
   --cluster my-cluster \
   --name ng-windows \
   --node-type t2.large \
   --nodes 3 \
   --nodes-min 1 \
   --nodes-max 4 \
   --node-ami-family WindowsServer2019FullContainer
Note
If nodes fail to join the cluster, see Nodes fail to join cluster in the Troubleshooting guide.
For more information on the available options for eksctl commands, enter the following command.  
 ```
 eksctl command -help
 ```

Output:
You'll see several lines of output as the nodes are created. One of the last lines of output is the following example line.
[âœ”]  created 1 nodegroup(s) in cluster "my-cluster"

(Optional) Deploy a sample application to test your cluster and Windows nodes.

To launch self-managed Windows nodes using the AWS Management Console
These procedures have the following prerequisites:
 You have an existing Amazon EKS cluster and a Linux node group. If you don't have these resources, we recommend that you follow one of our Getting started with Amazon EKS guides to create them. The guides provide a complete end-to-end walkthrough for creating an Amazon EKS cluster with Linux nodes.
 You have created a VPC and security group that meet the requirements for an Amazon EKS cluster. For more information, see Cluster VPC considerations and Amazon EKS security group considerations. The Getting started with Amazon EKS guide creates a VPC that meets the requirements, or you can also follow Creating a VPC for your Amazon EKS cluster to create one manually.


Wait for your cluster status to show as ACTIVE. If you launch your nodes before the cluster is active, the nodes will fail to register with the cluster and you will have to relaunch them.


Open the AWS CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation


Choose Create stack.


For Specify template, select Amazon S3 URL, then copy the following URL, paste it into Amazon S3 URL, and select Next twice.


https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation/2020-08-12/amazon-eks-windows-nodegroup.yaml


On the Quick create stack* page, fill out the following parameters accordingly:
    Stack name: Choose a stack name for your AWS CloudFormation stack. For example, you can call it cluster-name-nodes.
    ClusterName: Enter the name that you used when you created your Amazon EKS cluster.
Important
This name must exactly match the name you used in Step 1: Create your Amazon EKS cluster; otherwise, your nodes cannot join the cluster.
    ClusterControlPlaneSecurityGroup: Choose the SecurityGroups value from the AWS CloudFormation output that you generated with Create your Amazon EKS cluster VPC.
    NodeGroupName: Enter a name for your node group. This name can be used later to identify the Auto Scaling node group that is created for your nodes.
    NodeAutoScalingGroupMinSize: Enter the minimum number of nodes that your node Auto Scaling group can scale in to.
    NodeAutoScalingGroupDesiredCapacity: Enter the desired number of nodes to scale to when your stack is created.
    NodeAutoScalingGroupMaxSize: Enter the maximum number of nodes that your node Auto Scaling group can scale out to.
    NodeInstanceType: Choose an instance type for your nodes.
Note
The supported instance types for the latest version of the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes are shown here. You may need to update your CNI version to take advantage of the latest supported instance types. For more information, see Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes upgrades.
    NodeImageIdSSMParam: Pre-populated with the Amazon EC2 Systems Manager parameter of the current recommended Amazon EKS optimized Windows Core AMI ID. If you want to use the full version of Windows, then replace Core with Full.
    NodeImageId: (Optional) If you are using your own custom AMI (instead of the Amazon EKS optimized AMI), enter a node AMI ID for your Region. If you specify a value here, it overrides any values in the NodeImageIdSSMParam field.
    NodeVolumeSize: Specify a root volume size for your nodes, in GiB.
    KeyName: Enter the name of an Amazon EC2 SSH key pair that you can use to connect using SSH into your nodes with after they launch. If you don't already have an Amazon EC2 keypair, you can create one in the AWS Management Console. For more information, see Amazon EC2 key pairs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances.
Note
If you do not provide a keypair here, the AWS CloudFormation stack creation fails.
    BootstrapArguments: Specify any optional arguments to pass to the node bootstrap script, such as extra kubelet arguments using -KubeletExtraArgs. 
    DisableIMDSv1: Each node supports the Instance Metadata Service Version 1 (IMDSv1) and IMDSv2 by default, but you can disable IMDSv1. Select true if you don't want any nodes in the node group, or any pods scheduled on the nodes in the node group to use IMDSv1. For more information about IMDS, see Configuring the instance metadata service.
    VpcId: Select the ID for the VPC that you created in Create your Amazon EKS cluster VPC.
    NodeSecurityGroups: Select the security group that was created for your Linux node group in Create your Amazon EKS cluster VPC. If your Linux nodes have more than one security group attached to them (for example, if the Linux node group was created with eksctl), specify all of them here.
    Subnets: Choose the subnets that you created in Create your Amazon EKS cluster VPC. If you created your VPC using the steps described at Creating a VPC for your Amazon EKS cluster, then specify only the private subnets within the VPC for your nodes to launch into.
Important*
If any of the subnets are public subnets, then they must have the automatic public IP address assignment setting enabled. If the setting is not enabled for the public subnet, then any nodes that you deploy to that public subnet will not be assigned a public IP address and will not be able to communicate with the cluster or other AWS services. If the subnet was deployed before March 26, 2020 using either of the Amazon EKS AWS CloudFormation VPC templates, or by using eksctl, then automatic public IP address assignment is disabled for public subnets. For information about how to enable public IP address assignment for a subnet, see  Modifying the Public IPv4 Addressing Attribute for Your Subnet. If the node is deployed to a private subnet, then it is able to communicate with the cluster and other AWS services through a NAT gateway.


Acknowledge that the stack might create IAM resources, and then choose Create stack.


When your stack has finished creating, select it in the console and choose Outputs.


Record the NodeInstanceRole for the node group that was created. You need this when you configure your Amazon EKS Windows nodes.


To enable nodes to join your cluster


Download, edit, and apply the AWS IAM Authenticator configuration map.


Use the following command to download the configuration map:
curl -o aws-auth-cm-windows.yaml https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation/2020-08-12/aws-auth-cm-windows.yaml


Open the file with your favorite text editor. Replace the  and  snippets with the NodeInstanceRole values that you recorded for your Linux and Windows nodes, and save the file.
Important
Do not modify any other lines in this file.
apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: aws-auth
    namespace: kube-system
  data:
    mapRoles: |
      - rolearn: <ARN of instance role (not instance profile) of **Linux** node>
        username: system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}}
        groups:
          - system:bootstrappers
          - system:nodes
      - rolearn: <ARN of instance role (not instance profile) of **Windows** node>
        username: system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}}
        groups:
          - system:bootstrappers
          - system:nodes
          - eks:kube-proxy-windows


Apply the configuration. This command may take a few minutes to finish.
kubectl apply -f aws-auth-cm-windows.yaml
Note
If you receive any authorization or resource type errors, see Unauthorized or access denied (kubectl) in the troubleshooting section.
If nodes fail to join the cluster, then see Nodes fail to join cluster in the Troubleshooting guide.


Watch the status of your nodes and wait for them to reach the Ready status.


kubectl get nodes --watch

(Optional) Deploy a sample application to test your cluster and Windows nodes.
