Amazon EKS service quotas
Amazon EKS has integrated with Service Quotas, an AWS service that enables you to view and manage your quotas from a central location. For more information, see What Is Service Quotas? in the Service Quotas User Guide. Service Quotas makes it easy to look up the value of your Amazon EKS and AWS Fargate service quotas using the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI.
To view Amazon EKS and Fargate service quotas using the AWS Management Console


Open the Service Quotas console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/.


In the navigation panel, choose AWS services.


From the AWS services list, search for and select Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) or AWS Fargate.


In the Service quotas list, you can see the service quota name, applied value (if it is available), AWS default quota, and whether the quota value is adjustable.


To view additional information about a service quota, such as the description, choose the quota name.


(Optional) To request a quota increase, select the quota that you want to increase, select Request quota increase, enter or select the required information, and select Request.


To work more with service quotas using the AWS Management Console see the Service Quotas User Guide. To request a quota increase, see Requesting a Quota Increase in the Service Quotas User Guide.

To view Amazon EKS and Fargate service quotas using the AWS CLI
Run the following command to view your Amazon EKS quotas.
aws service-quotas list-aws-default-service-quotas \
    --query 'Quotas[*].{Adjustable:Adjustable,Name:QuotaName,Value:Value,Code:QuotaCode}' \
    --service-code eks \
    --output table
Run the following command to view your Fargate quotas.
aws service-quotas list-aws-default-service-quotas \
    --query 'Quotas[*].{Adjustable:Adjustable,Name:QuotaName,Value:Value,Code:QuotaCode}' \
    --service-code fargate \
    --output table
Note
The quota returned is the maximum number of Amazon ECS tasks or Amazon EKS pods running concurrently on Fargate in this account in the current Region.
To work more with service quotas using the AWS CLI, see the Service Quotas AWS CLI Command Reference. To request a quota increase, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/request-service-quota-increase.html command in the AWS CLI Command Reference.
