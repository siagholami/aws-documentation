Traffic Mirror Filters and Filter Rules
A traffic mirror filter is a set of inbound and outbound traffic rules that define the traffic that is copied from the traffic mirror source, and sent to the traffic mirror destination. By default, no traffic is mirrored. To mirror traffic, add traffic mirror rules to the filter. The rules that you add define what traffic gets mirrored. You can also choose to mirror certain network services traffic, including Amazon DNS. When you add network services traffic, all traffic (inbound and outbound) related to that network service is mirrored.
