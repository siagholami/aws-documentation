Traffic Mirror Sessions
A traffic mirror session establishes a relationship between a traffic mirror source and a traffic mirror target.
A traffic mirror session contains the following resources:
 A traffic mirror source
 A traffic mirror target 
 A traffic mirror filter
A given packet is only mirrored one time. However, you can use multiple traffic mirror sessions on the same source when you want to send a subset of the mirrored traffic from a traffic mirror source to different tools. For example, you can filter HTTP traffic in a higher priority traffic mirror session and send it to a specific monitoring appliance. Then you can filter all other TCP traffic in a lower priority traffic mirror session and send it to another monitoring appliance.
Traffic mirror sessions are evaluated based on the ascending priority that you define when you create the session.

Before you create a traffic mirror session, make sure that you have the following information:
 The source
 The traffic mirror target
   To use a target in your account, see Create a Traffic Mirror Target.
   To use a target that is owned by another account and shared with you, accept the shared resource before you create the traffic mirror session. For more information, see Accepting a Resource Share.
 The traffic mirror filter (for more information, see Create a Traffic Mirror Filter)
To create a traffic mirror session using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the Region selector, choose the AWS Region that you used when you created the VPCs.


In the navigation pane, choose Traffic Mirroring, Mirror Sessions.


Choose Create traffic mirror session.


(Optional) For Name tag, enter a name for the traffic mirror session.


(Optional) For Description, enter a description for the traffic mirror session.


For Mirror source, choose the network interface of the instance that you want to monitor. 


For Mirror target, choose the traffic mirror target.


To create a target, choose Create target. For more information, see Create a Traffic Mirror Target.


Under Additional settings, do the following:


For Session number, enter the session number.
The session number determines the order that traffic mirror sessions are evaluated when an interface is used by multiple sessions that have the same interface, but have different traffic mirror targets and traffic mirror filters. Traffic is only mirrored one time.
Use 1 for the highest priority.
Valid values are 1-32766.


(Optional) For VNI, enter the VXLAN ID to use for the traffic mirror session. For more information about the VXLAN protocol, see RFC 7348.
If you do not enter a value, we assign a random number.


(Optional) For Packet Length, enter the number of bytes in each packet to mirror.
If you do not want to mirror the entire packet, set Packet Length to the number of bytes in each packet to mirror. For example, if you set this value to 100, the first 100 bytes after the VXLAN header that meet the filter criteria are copied to the target.
To mirror the entire packet, do not enter a value in this field.


For Filter, choose the traffic mirror filter that determines what traffic gets mirrored.
To create a filter, choose Create filter. For more information, see Step 2: Create the Traffic Mirror Filter.


(Optional) Add or remove a tag.


[Add a tag] Choose Add tag and do the following:
    For Key, enter the key name.
    For Value, enter the key value.
[Remove a tag] Next to the tag, choose Remove tag.

Choose Create.

To create a traffic mirror session using the AWS CLI
Use the create-traffic-mirror-session command.
Modify Your Traffic Mirror Session
To modify your traffic mirror session using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the Region selector, choose the AWS Region that you used when you created the traffic mirror session.


In the navigation pane, choose Traffic Mirroring, Mirror Sessions.


Select the traffic mirror session.


Choose Modify session.


(Optional) For Description, enter a description for the traffic mirror session.


For Mirror target, choose the traffic mirror target.


To create a target, choose Create target. For more information, see Create a Traffic Mirror Target.


Under Additional settings, do the following:


For Session number, enter the session number.
The session number determines the order that traffic mirror sessions are evaluated when an interface is used by multiple sessions, but that have different traffic mirror targets and traffic mirror filters. Traffic is only mirrored one time.
Use 1 for the highest priority.
Valid values are 1-32766.


(Optional) For VNI, enter the VXLAN ID to use for the traffic mirror session. For more information about the VXLAN protocol, see RFC 7348.
If you do not enter a value, we assign a random unused number.


(Optional) For Packet Length, enter the number of bytes in each packet to mirror.
If you do not want to mirror the entire packet, set Packet Length to the number of bytes in each packet to mirror. For example, if you set this value to 100, the first 100 bytes after the VXLAN header that meet the filter criteria are copied to the target.
To mirror the entire packet, do not enter a value in this field.


For Filter, choose the traffic mirror filter that determines what traffic gets mirrored.
