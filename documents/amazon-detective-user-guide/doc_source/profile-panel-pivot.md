# Pivoting from a profile panel to another entity or finding profile<a name="profile-panel-pivot"></a>

When a profile panel contains an identifier of a different finding or entity, it is usually a link to that finding or entity profile\. The exceptions are the links to the Amazon EC2 and IAM consoles on the EC2 instance, AWS user, and AWS role profiles\. See [Pivoting from a profile panel to another console](profile-panel-console-links.md)\.

For example, from a list of IP addresses, you might be able to display the profile for a specific IP address\. That way you can see if there is any other information available to help you to complete your investigation\.

When you pivot to a finding profile, if the scope time does not match the finding time window, a warning is displayed\.

For information on setting the scope time, see [Managing the scope time used on finding and entity profiles](scope-time-managing.md)\. When you edit the scope time from a finding profile, you can choose to align the scope time to the finding time window\.
