# Exploring activity details on a profile panel<a name="profile-panel-drilldown"></a>

After making an initial assessment that a finding might be a true positive, the next step is to dig deeper into the pattern of activity for the related resources\.

On the following profile panels, you can display a summary of the activity details\.
+ **Overall API call volume**, except for the profile panels on the IP address profile and the user agent profile
+ **Newly observed geolocations**, except for the profile panel on the federated user profile
+ **Overall VPC flow volume**

The activity details can answer these types of questions:
+ Which IP addresses were used?
+ Where were those IP addresses located?
+ Which API calls did each IP address make?
+ Which access key identifiers \(AKIDs\) were used to make the calls?
+ What resources were used to make those calls?
+ How many calls were made? How many succeeded and failed?
+ What volume of VPC flow data was sent to or from each IP address?
