# Viewing and interacting with profile panels<a name="profile-panels"></a>

Each finding or entity profile on the Amazon Detective console consists of a set of profile panels\. A profile panel is a visualization that provides general details or highlights specific activity associated with a finding or entity\. Profile panels use different types of visualizations to present different types of information\. They can also provide links to additional details or to other profiles\.

Each profile panel is intended to help analysts find answers to specific questions about findings, the involved entities, and their associated activity\. The answers to those questions help lead to a conclusion about whether a finding represents a genuine threat\.

For finding profiles, most of the profile panels contain information related to the involved entity\. For example, a finding involves the suspected misuse of an Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) role\. For that finding, the finding profile panels analyze how that role was used around the time of the finding activity\.
