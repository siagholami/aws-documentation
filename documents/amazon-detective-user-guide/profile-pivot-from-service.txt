Pivoting to a finding profile from Amazon GuardDuty or AWS Security Hub
From the Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub consoles, you can navigate to Amazon Detective finding profiles.
These links can help to streamline the investigation process. When a finding might be a genuine cause for concern, you can quickly use Detective to see the associated resource activity and determine next steps. You can then archive the finding if it is a false positive or explore further to determine the scope of the problem.
How to pivot to the Amazon Detective console
The investigation links only work for GuardDuty finding types that Detective supports. See Supported finding types.
To pivot to Detective from the GuardDuty console


Open the GuardDuty console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/.


If necessary, choose Findings in the left navigation pane.


On the GuardDuty Findings page, choose the check box for the finding.


From the Actions menu, choose Investigate in Detective.


To pivot to Detective from the Security Hub console


Open the AWS Security Hub console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/.


If necessary, choose Findings in the left navigation pane.


On the Security Hub Findings page, choose a GuardDuty finding.


In the details pane, choose Investigate in Detective and then choose Investigate finding.


The link is only available for finding types that Detective supports.
When you choose Investigate finding, the Detective console opens in a new tab. The console opens to the finding profile.
Troubleshooting the pivot
To use the pivot, one of the following must be true:
 Your account must be a master account for both Detective and the service you are pivoting from.
 You have assumed a cross-account role that grants you master account access to the behavior graph.
For more information about the recommendation to align master accounts, see Recommended alignment with Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub in Detective Administration Guide.
If the pivot does not work, check the following.
 Does Detective support that finding type? If the finding type is not one of the types listed in Supported finding types, then the behavior graph does not contain data for it.
 Does the finding belong to an enabled member account in your behavior graph? If the associated account was not invited to the behavior graph as a member account, then the behavior graph does not contain data for that account.
If an invited member account did not accept the invitation, then the behavior graph does not contain data for that account.
 Is the finding archived? Detective does not receive archived findings from GuardDuty.
 Did the finding occur before Detective began to ingest data into your behavior graph? If the finding is not present in the data that Detective ingests, then the behavior graph does not contain data for it.
 Is the finding from the correct Region? Each behavior graph is specific to a Region. A behavior graph does not contain data from other Regions.
