Prerequisites
To use Amazon WorkMail you'll need an AWS account. If you haven't signed up for AWS yet, complete the following tasks to get set up.
Topics
 Get an AWS account and your root user credentials
 Create AWS Identity and Access Management users and groups
Get an AWS account and your root user credentials
To access AWS, you must sign up for an AWS account.
To sign up for an AWS account


Open https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.


Follow the online instructions.


Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.
AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign-up process is complete. At any time, you can view your current account activity and manage your account by going to https://aws.amazon.com/ and choosing My Account.
Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS. If you don't have access keys, you can create them from the AWS Management Console. As a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user access keys for any task where it's not required. Instead, create a new administrator IAM user with access keys for yourself.
The only time that you can view or download the secret access key is when you create the keys. You cannot recover them later. However, you can create new access keys at any time. You must also have permissions to perform the required IAM actions. For more information, see Permissions Required to Access IAM Resources in the IAM User Guide.
To create access keys for an IAM user


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Users.


Choose the name of the user whose access keys you want to create, and then choose the Security credentials tab.


In the Access keys section, choose Create access key.


To view the new access key pair, choose Show. You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes. Your credentials will look something like this:
    Access key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
    Secret access key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY


To download the key pair, choose Download .csv file. Store the keys in a secure location. You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes.


Keep the keys confidential in order to protect your AWS account and never email them. Do not share them outside your organization, even if an inquiry appears to come from AWS or Amazon.com. No one who legitimately represents Amazon will ever ask you for your secret key.

After you download the .csv file, choose Close. When you create an access key, the key pair is active by default, and you can use the pair right away.

Create AWS Identity and Access Management users and groups
The AWS Management Console requires your username and password so that the service can determine whether you have permission to access its resources. We recommend that you avoid using root account credentials to access AWS because root account credentials cannot be revoked or limited in any way. Instead, use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create an IAM user and add the user to an IAM group with administrative permissions. You can then access the console using the credentials for the IAM user.
If you signed up for AWS but have not created an IAM user for yourself, you can create one using the IAM console. For more information, see Create Individual IAM Users in IAM User Guide.
Grant IAM users permissions for Amazon WorkMail
By default, IAM users don't have permissions to manage Amazon WorkMail resources; you must attach an AWS managed policy (AmazonWorkMailFullAccess or AmazonWorkMailReadOnlyAccess) or create a customer managed policy that explicitly grants IAM users those permissions, and attach the policy to the specific IAM users or groups that require those permissions. For more information, see Identity and access management for Amazon WorkMail.
