Enabling signed or encrypted email
You can use S/MIME to enable users to send signed or encrypted email both inside and outside the organization.
Note
User certificates in the Global Address List (GAL) are supported only in a connected Active Directory setup.
To enable users to send signed or encrypted emails


Set up an Active Directory (AD) Connector. Setting up an AD Connector with your on-premises directory allows users to continue to use their existing corporate credentials.


Configure Certificate Autoenrollment to issue and store user certificates automatically in the Active Directory. Amazon WorkMail receives user certificates from the Active Directory and publishes them to the GAL. For more information, see Configure Certificate Autoenrollment.


Distribute the generated certificates to users by exporting the certificates from the server running Microsoft Exchange and mailing them.


Each user installs the certificate to their email program (such as Windows Outlook) and mobile devices.
