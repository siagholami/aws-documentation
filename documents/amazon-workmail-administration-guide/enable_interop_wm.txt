Using Microsoft Outlook

1. Hold the **Ctrl** key and open the context \(right\-click\) menu on the Microsoft Outlook icon in the task bar\.

1. Choose **Test E\-mail AutoConfiguration**\.

Using PowerShell
     
  ```
  Get-WebServicesVirtualDirectory |Select name, *url* | fl
  ```

The external URL returned by the above command is the EWS URL\.


User email address and password—These are the credentials of the Microsoft Exchange service account and are encrypted and securely stored by Amazon WorkMail. The email address of the Microsoft Exchange service account should use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). For more information, see Create service accounts in Microsoft Exchange and Amazon WorkMail.

If your Active Directory domain is not the same as your Microsoft Exchange domain, use the User Principal Name (UPN) of the Microsoft Exchange Service account. This can be obtained with the following PowerShell command:
Get-ADUser exchange_service_account_username | select UserPrincipalName
In the above example, exchange_service_account_username is the username of the Microsoft Exchange Service account.
