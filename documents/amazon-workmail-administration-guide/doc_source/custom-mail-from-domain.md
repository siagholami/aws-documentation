# Configuring a custom MAIL FROM domain in Amazon WorkMail<a name="custom-mail-from-domain"></a>

By default, Amazon WorkMail uses a subdomain of `amazonses.com` as the `MAIL FROM` domain for your outgoing email\. This can cause delivery failure if the DMARC policy on your domain is only set up for SPF\. To resolve this, configure your own domain as the `MAIL FROM` domain\. To learn how to set up your email domain as the `MAIL FROM` domain, see [Setting up a custom MAIL FROM domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/mail-from.html) in the *Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide*\.

For more information about custom `MAIL FROM` domains, see [Amazon SES now supports custom MAIL FROM domains](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/messaging-and-targeting/amazon-ses-now-supports-custom-mail-from-domains/)\.
