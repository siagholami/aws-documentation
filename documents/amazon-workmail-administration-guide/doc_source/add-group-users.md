# Add users to a group<a name="add-group-users"></a>

After you create and enable an Amazon WorkMail group, use the Amazon WorkMail console to add users to that group\.

**Note**  
If Amazon WorkMail is integrated with a connected Active Directory service or Microsoft Active Directory, you can manage your group members using Active Directory\. This can take a longer time to propagate to Amazon WorkMail\.

You can add up to 100 users at a time by using the following procedure\.

**To add users to a group**

1. Open the Amazon WorkMail console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/workmail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/)\.

1. If you require a different AWS Region, change it from the navigation bar\. For more information, see [Regions and endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

1. For **Organizations**, choose the name of your organization\.

1. Choose **Groups**\.

1. Choose **Edit**\.

1. Under **Users and groups**, search for the users to add to the group, and select them\.
