# Remove users from a group<a name="remove-group-users"></a>

Use the Amazon WorkMail console to remove users from a group\.

**Note**  
If Amazon WorkMail is integrated with a connected Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory, you can manage your group members using the Active Directory\. This can take a longer time to propagate to Amazon WorkMail\.
