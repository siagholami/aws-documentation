Step 1: Sign in to the Amazon WorkMail console
You must sign in to the Amazon WorkMail console before you can add users and manage accounts and mailboxes.
To sign in to the Amazon WorkMail console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon WorkMail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/.


If necessary, go to the navigation bar and select the AWS Region that meets your needs. For more information, see Regions and endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.


Step 2: Set up your Amazon WorkMail site


After you sign in to the Amazon WorkMail console, set up your organization. Choose from the following organization setup options:
    Quick setup: Creating a new directory - Sets up a new directory for you
    Standard setup: Integrating with an existing directory - Integrates with your existing directory


Next, add a domain. We recommend registering a dedicated domain for your Amazon WorkMail organization. For more information about adding a domain, see Adding a domain.
Note
You can start using your Amazon WorkMail organization with the provided test domain created during setup. The test domain format is example.awsapps.com. You can use the test mail domain as long as you maintain enabled users in your Amazon WorkMail organization. However, the test domain cannot be used outside of Amazon WorkMail. Also, the test domain might become available for registration and use by other customers if your Amazon WorkMail organization does not maintain at least one enabled user. 


Create new users or enable your existing directory users for Amazon WorkMail. For more information, see Creating users.


(Optional) If you have existing Microsoft Exchange mailboxes, migrate them to Amazon WorkMail. For more information, see Migrating to Amazon WorkMail.
