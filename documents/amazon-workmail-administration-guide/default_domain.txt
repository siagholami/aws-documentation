Choosing the default domain
To use a domain as default in the email address of your users and groups, you can choose a default domain. Making a domain the default does not change existing email addresses.
To make a domain the default


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon WorkMail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/.


If necessary, change the AWS Region. From the navigation bar, select the Region that meets your needs. For more information, see Regions and endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.


For Organizations, choose the name of the organization to which to add a default domain.


In the list of domains, select the check box next to the domain name and choose Set as default.
