Understanding the dollar estimate of the CPU cost for frames
Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides an estimated dollar value for the active CPU cost of a frame. The value is an estimation that can help you understand where your optimization efforts will be most valuable. 
To view a frame's dollar estimate, pause over the frame. When you pause over other frames, you will see a dollar value estimation that's based on that frame's portion of the total CPU time.
Note
This estimated value does not represent your monthly bill. 
The estimated dollar value shown on the ALL frame represents the yearly cost of the compute fleet seen during profiling. This is based on the on-demand AWS compute pricing in the AWS Region of your profiling group. 
To view information about your compute fleet, choose Actions, then choose Additional proÔ¨Åling data information.
