Working with profiling groups
A profiling group is a set of applications that are profiled together as a unit. Application data is sent by the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler profiling agent to a single profile group. Data from all applications in a profiling group are aggregated and analyzed together. 
You manage profiling groups from the Profiling groups page. The page provides a list of your profiling groups and the status. You can also create or delete a profiling group. When you select a profiling group, you can explore your profiling data by using different visualizations.
