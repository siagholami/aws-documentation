Deleting a profiling group
When you delete a profiling group, the profiling group and recommendations reports are deleted. Application data in the profiling group will be inaccessible. While Amazon CodeGuru Profiler is in preview, contact AWS Support to have the profiling data deleted. 
To delete a profiling group


In the navigation pane on the left, choose Profiling groups.


Select the profiling group to delete.


Choose Actions, Delete profiling group. 


On the confirmation page, choose Delete to delete the profiling group.


Remove the CodeGuru Profiler profiling agent code from the Java applications in the profiling group. You can also modify the code to send data to a different profiling group.
