A *profiling group* is a set of applications that are profiled together as a unit\. Application data is sent by the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler profiling agent to a single profile group\. Data from all applications in a profiling group are aggregated and analyzed together\. 

You manage profiling groups from the **Profiling groups** page\. The page provides a list of your profiling groups and the status\. You can also create or delete a profiling group\. When you select a profiling group, you can explore your profiling data by using different [visualizations](working-with-visualizations.md)\.
