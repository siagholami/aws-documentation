# Understanding the dollar estimate of the CPU cost for frames<a name="working-with-visualizations-additional-info"></a>

Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides an estimated dollar value for the active CPU cost of a frame\. The value is an estimation that can help you understand where your optimization efforts will be most valuable\. 

To view a frame's dollar estimate, pause over the frame\. When you pause over other frames, you will see a dollar value estimation that's based on that frame's portion of the total CPU time\.

**Note**  
This estimated value does not represent your monthly bill\. 

The estimated dollar value shown on the **ALL** frame represents the yearly cost of the compute fleet seen during profiling\. This is based on the on\-demand AWS compute pricing in the AWS Region of your profiling group\. 

To view information about your compute fleet, choose **Actions**, then choose **Additional proﬁling data information**\.
