# Selecting a custom time range<a name="working-with-visualizations-time-range"></a>

By default, visualizations display the latest hour of data from the profiling group\. You can select a different start time and end time to explore other data for other time ranges\. This can be helpful to see how performance has changed over time\. 

**To select a custom time range**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codeguru](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codeguru)\.

1. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Profiler**, and then select **Profiling groups**\.

1. On the **Profiling groups** page, select a profiling group\.

1. In the **Profiling group detail** page, at the top of the visualization, select the date/time displayed\. For example, **2019\-12\-04 @ 7:30 \- 7:40 PST**\. 

1. In the **Select a custom time range** page, choose a **Start time**\. You can optionally keep the existing start time\. 

1. Choose an **End time**\. You can optionally keep the existing end time\. 

1. Choose **Confirm** to update the visualization\. 

If there is not enough data for the selected range, select a different time range\. For the CodeGuru Profiler preview, you can reset the time range back to the default by choosing **Profiler**, **Profiling groups** in the navigation pane, and then selecting the profiling group\.
