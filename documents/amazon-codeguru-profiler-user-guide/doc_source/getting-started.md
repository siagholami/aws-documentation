# Getting started with CodeGuru Profiler<a name="getting-started"></a>

After you set up Amazon CodeGuru Profiler, you can use the demo application to learn about profiling groups\. For more information about using the demo application, see the [Amazon CodeGuru Profiler Demo Application](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-codeguru-profiler-demo-application)\. It will help to familiarize you with profiling groups and the ways you can visualize application data in CodeGuru Profiler\. It's also a good place to start if you're new to profiling\. 

CodeGuru Profiler has two perpetual demo profiling groups that are indicated with the prefix `{CodeGuru}` and the blue DEMO badge\. The `{CodeGuru} DemoProfilingGroup-WithIssues` group is unoptimized and has a report with generated recommendations that you can view\. The demo groups look like the following\.
