Inspecting a frame
You can inspect frames that appear in many places in a visualization. This can happen when your application code has a common set of shared functions. 
For example, if you have code that compresses data, you might call it from dozens of functions. If you inspect the compress function, you can see the parent (callers) and children (callee) functions at a glance. 
To inspect a frame


On the Profiling group detail page, pause over the frame you want to inspect on the visualization. 


Open the context (right-click) menu, and then choose Inspect frame.
