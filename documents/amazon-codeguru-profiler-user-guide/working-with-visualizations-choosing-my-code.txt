Choosing my code in visualizations
CodeGuru Profiler differentiates your code in the Overview visualization, so you can quickly identify the methods you are working on. 
The blue portion of the flame graph highlights your code. The green portion of the graph highlights other code that your application uses, such as libraries and frameworks.

You can change the coloring by manually selecting which package name you want CodeGuru Profiler to identify as your code.
