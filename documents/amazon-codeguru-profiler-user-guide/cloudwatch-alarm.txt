Monitoring profiling groups with CloudWatch alarms
You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for your profiling groups to monitor their recommendations. 
An alarm watches the number of recommendations for a profiling group over a period of time that you specify. You set one or more actions that happen when the number of recommendations for a profiling group exeeds a count over a number of time periods you choose. For example, you can specify that an Amazon SNS notification is sent when more than five recommendations are generated for a profiling group within an hour. 
A user or role must have CloudWatch PutMetricAlarm permissions to create an alarm. For more information, see Using identity-based policies for CodeGuru Profiler and Amazon CloudWatch permissions reference in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
