Specify custom IAM roles
Example 
By default, AWS Data Pipeline passes DataPipelineDefaultRole as the Amazon EMR service role and DataPipelineDefaultResourceRole as the Amazon EC2 instance profile to create resources on your behalf. However, you can create a custom Amazon EMR service role and a custom instance profile and use them instead. AWS Data Pipeline should have sufficient permissions to create clusters using the custom role, and you must add AWS Data Pipeline as a trusted entity.
The following example object specifies custom roles for the Amazon EMR cluster:  
{  
   "id":"MyEmrCluster",
   "type":"EmrCluster",
   "hadoopVersion":"2.x",
   "keyPair":"my-key-pair",
   "masterInstanceType":"m3.xlarge",
   "coreInstanceType":"m3.large",
   "coreInstanceCount":"10",
   "taskInstanceType":"m3.large",
   "taskInstanceCount":"10",
   "role":"emrServiceRole",
   "resourceRole":"emrInstanceProfile"
}
