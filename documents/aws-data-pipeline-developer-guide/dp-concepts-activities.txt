Activities
In AWS Data Pipeline, an activity is a pipeline component that defines the work to perform. AWS Data Pipeline provides several pre-packaged activities that accommodate common scenarios, such as moving data from one location to another, running Hive queries, and so on. Activities are extensible, so you can run your own custom scripts to support endless combinations.
AWS Data Pipeline supports the following types of activities:
CopyActivity
Copies data from one location to another.
EmrActivity
Runs an Amazon EMR cluster.
HiveActivity
Runs a Hive query on an Amazon EMR cluster.
HiveCopyActivity
Runs a Hive query on an Amazon EMR cluster with support for advanced data filtering and support for S3DataNode and DynamoDBDataNode.
PigActivity

RedshiftCopyActivity
Copies data to and from Amazon Redshift tables.
ShellCommandActivity
Runs a custom UNIX/Linux shell command as an activity.
SqlActivity

Some activities have special support for staging data and database tables. For more information, see Staging Data and Tables with Pipeline Activities.
