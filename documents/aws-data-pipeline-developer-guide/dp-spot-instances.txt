Using Amazon EC2 Spot Instances in a Pipeline
Pipelines can use Amazon EC2 Spot Instances for the task nodes in their Amazon EMR cluster resources. By default, pipelines use on-demand Amazon EC2 instances. In addition, you can use Spot Instances. Spot Instances let you use spare Amazon EC2 instances and run them. The Spot Instance pricing model complements the on-demand and Reserved Instance pricing models, potentially providing the most cost-effective option for obtaining compute capacity, depending on your application. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Spot Instances on the Amazon EC2 Product Page. 
To use Spot Instances in your pipeline


Open the AWS Data Pipeline console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/.


Open your pipeline in Architect.


In the Resources pane, go to the EMR cluster. In Add an optional field, select Task Instance Bid Price. Set Task Instance Bid Price to your maximum price for a Spot Instance per hour. This is the maximum dollar amount you pay, and is a decimal value between 0 and 20.00 exclusive.
