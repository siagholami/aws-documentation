Import DynamoDB Backup Data from S3
The Import DynamoDB backup data from S3 template schedules an Amazon EMR cluster to load a previously created DynamoDB backup in Amazon S3 to a DynamoDB table. Existing items in the DynamoDB table are updated with those from the backup data and new items are added to the table. This template uses an Amazon EMR cluster, which is sized proportionally to the value of the throughput available to the DynamoDB table. Although you can increase IOPs on a table, this may incur additional costs while importing and exporting. Previously, import used a HiveActivity but now uses native MapReduce.
The template uses the following pipeline objects:
 EmrActivity
 EmrCluster
 DynamoDBDataNode
 S3DataNode
 S3PrefixNotEmpty
