Before You Begin: Configure COPY Options and Load Data
Before copying data to Amazon Redshift within AWS Data Pipeline, ensure that you: 
 Load data from Amazon S3.
 Set up the COPY activity in Amazon Redshift. 
Once you have these options working and successfully complete a data load, transfer these options to AWS Data Pipeline, for performing the copying within it.
For COPY options, see COPY in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide. 
For steps to load data from Amazon S3, see Loading data from Amazon S3 in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide. 
For example, the following SQL command in Amazon Redshift creates a new table named LISTING and copies sample data from a publicly available bucket in Amazon S3. 
Replace the <iam-role-arn> and region with your own. 
For details about this example, see Load Sample Data from Amazon S3 in the Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide.
```
create table listing(
    listid integer not null distkey,
    sellerid integer not null,
    eventid integer not null,
    dateid smallint not null  sortkey,
    numtickets smallint not null,
    priceperticket decimal(8,2),
    totalprice decimal(8,2),
    listtime timestamp);
copy listing from 's3://awssampledbuswest2/tickit/listings_pipe.txt' 
credentials 'aws_iam_role=' 
delimiter '|' region 'us-west-2';
