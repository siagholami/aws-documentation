Copy Data to Amazon Redshift Using AWS Data Pipeline
This tutorial walks you through the process of creating a pipeline that periodically moves data from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift using either the Copy to Redshift template in the AWS Data Pipeline console, or a pipeline definition file with the AWS Data Pipeline CLI.
Amazon S3 is a web service that enables you to store data in the cloud. For more information, see the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide. 
Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse service in the cloud. For more information, see the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.
This tutorial has several prerequisites. After completing the following steps, you can continue the tutorial using either the console or the CLI.
