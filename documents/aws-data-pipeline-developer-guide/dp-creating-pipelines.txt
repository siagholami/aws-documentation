 Use the console to manually add individual pipeline objects. For more information, see Creating Pipelines Using the Console Manually.
 Use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) with a pipeline definition file in JSON format.
 Use an AWS SDK with a language-specific API. For more information, see Working with the API.
