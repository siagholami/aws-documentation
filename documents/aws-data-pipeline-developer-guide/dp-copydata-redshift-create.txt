Copy Data to Amazon Redshift Using the AWS Data Pipeline Console
You can create a pipeline to copy data from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift. You'll create a new table in Amazon Redshift, and then use AWS Data Pipeline to transfer data to this table from a public Amazon S3 bucket, which contains sample input data in CSV format. The logs are saved to an Amazon S3 bucket that you own.
Amazon S3 is a web service that enables you to store data in the cloud. For more information, see the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide. 
Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse service in the cloud. For more information, see the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.

Create the Pipeline
First, create the pipeline.
This pipeline relies on the options of the Syntax.
It uses the Copy to Redshift template in the AWS Data Pipeline console. For information about this template, see Load Data from Amazon S3 into Amazon Redshift.
To create the pipeline


Open the AWS Data Pipeline console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/.


The first screen that you see depends on whether you've created a pipeline in the current region.


If you haven't created a pipeline in this region, the console displays an introductory screen. Choose Get started now.


If you've already created a pipeline in this region, the console displays a page that lists your pipelines for the region. Choose Create new pipeline.


In Name, enter a name for your pipeline.


(Optional) In Description, enter a description for your pipeline.


For Source, select Build using a template, and then select the following template: Load data from S3 into Redshift.


Under Parameters, provide information about your input folder in Amazon S3 and the Amazon Redshift database that you created.


Under Schedule, choose on pipeline activation.


Under Pipeline Configuration, leave logging enabled. Choose the folder icon under S3 location for logs, select one of your buckets or folders, and then choose Select.


If you prefer, you can disable logging instead.


Under Security/Access, leave IAM roles set to Default.


Click Activate.


If you prefer, you can choose Edit in Architect to modify this pipeline. For example, you can add preconditions.
Save and Validate Your Pipeline
You can save your pipeline definition at any point during the creation process. As soon as you save your pipeline definition, AWS Data Pipeline looks for syntax errors and missing values in your pipeline definition. If your pipeline is incomplete or incorrect, AWS Data Pipeline generates validation errors and warnings. Warning messages are informational only, but you must fix any error messages before you can activate your pipeline.
To save and validate your pipeline


Choose Save pipeline.


AWS Data Pipeline validates your pipeline definition and returns either success or error or warning messages. If you get an error message, choose Close and then, in the right pane, choose Errors/Warnings.


The Errors/Warnings pane lists the objects that failed validation. Choose the plus () sign next to the object names and look for an error message in red.


When you see an error message, go to the specific object pane where you see the error and fix it. For example, if you see an error message in the DataNodes object, go to the DataNodes pane to fix the error.


After you fix the errors listed in the Errors/Warnings pane, choose Save Pipeline.


Repeat the process until your pipeline validates successfully.


Activate Your Pipeline
Activate your pipeline to start creating and processing runs. The pipeline starts based on the schedule and period in your pipeline definition.
Important
If activation succeeds, your pipeline is running and might incur usage charges. For more information, see AWS Data Pipeline pricing. To stop incurring usage charges for AWS Data Pipeline, delete your pipeline.
To activate your pipeline


Choose Activate.


In the confirmation dialog box, choose Close.


Monitor the Pipeline Runs
After you activate your pipeline, you are taken to the Execution details page where you can monitor the progress of your pipeline.
To monitor the progress of your pipeline runs


Choose Update or press F5 to update the status displayed.
Tip
If there are no runs listed, ensure that Start (in UTC) and End (in UTC) cover the scheduled start and end of your pipeline, and then choose Update.


When the status of every object in your pipeline is FINISHED, your pipeline has successfully completed the scheduled tasks. If you created an SNS notification, you should receive email about the successful completion of this task.


If your pipeline doesn't complete successfully, check your pipeline settings for issues. For more information about troubleshooting failed or incomplete instance runs of your pipeline, see Resolving Common Problems.


(Optional) Delete Your Pipeline
To stop incurring charges, delete your pipeline. Deleting your pipeline deletes the pipeline definition and all associated objects.
To delete your pipeline


On the List Pipelines page, select your pipeline.


Click Actions, and then choose Delete.


When prompted for confirmation, choose Delete.
