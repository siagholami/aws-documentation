AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm MetricStat
This structure defines the metric to be returned, along with the statistics, period, and units.
MetricStat is a property of the MetricDataQuery property type.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "[Metric](#cfn-cloudwatch-alarm-metricstat-metric)" : Metric,
  "[Period](#cfn-cloudwatch-alarm-metricstat-period)" : Integer,
  "[Stat](#cfn-cloudwatch-alarm-metricstat-stat)" : String,
  "[Unit](#cfn-cloudwatch-alarm-metricstat-unit)" : String
}
YAML
[Metric](#cfn-cloudwatch-alarm-metricstat-metric): 
    Metric
  [Period](#cfn-cloudwatch-alarm-metricstat-period): Integer
  [Stat](#cfn-cloudwatch-alarm-metricstat-stat): String
  [Unit](#cfn-cloudwatch-alarm-metricstat-unit): String
Properties
Metric 
The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.
Required: Yes
Type: Metric
Update requires: No interruption
Period 
The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a PutMetricData call that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second.
If the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:
 Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).
 Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).
 Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).
Required: Yes
Type: Integer
Minimum: 1
Update requires: No interruption
Stat 
The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic. For a list of valid values, see the table in  Statistics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption

The unit to use for the returned data points. 
Valid values are: Seconds, Microseconds, Milliseconds, Bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes, Bits, Kilobits, Megabits, Gigabits, Terabits, Percent, Count, Bytes/Second, Kilobytes/Second, Megabytes/Second, Gigabytes/Second, Terabytes/Second, Bits/Second, Kilobits/Second, Megabits/Second, Gigabits/Second, Terabits/Second, Count/Second, or None.
