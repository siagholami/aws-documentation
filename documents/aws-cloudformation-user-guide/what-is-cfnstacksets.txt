Working with AWS CloudFormation StackSets
AWS CloudFormation StackSets extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation. Using an administrator account, you define and manage an AWS CloudFormation template, and use the template as the basis for provisioning stacks into selected target accounts across specified regions.

This section helps you get started using StackSets, and answers common questions about how to work with and troubleshoot stack set creation, updates, and deletion.
