AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Member ApprovalThresholdPolicy
A policy type that defines the voting rules for the network. The rules decide if a proposal is approved. Approval may be based on criteria such as the percentage of YES votes and the duration of the proposal. The policy applies to all proposals and is specified when the network is created.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "[ProposalDurationInHours](#cfn-managedblockchain-member-approvalthresholdpolicy-proposaldurationinhours)" : Integer,
  "[ThresholdComparator](#cfn-managedblockchain-member-approvalthresholdpolicy-thresholdcomparator)" : String,
  "[ThresholdPercentage](#cfn-managedblockchain-member-approvalthresholdpolicy-thresholdpercentage)" : Integer
}
YAML
[ProposalDurationInHours](#cfn-managedblockchain-member-approvalthresholdpolicy-proposaldurationinhours): Integer
  [ThresholdComparator](#cfn-managedblockchain-member-approvalthresholdpolicy-thresholdcomparator): String
  [ThresholdPercentage](#cfn-managedblockchain-member-approvalthresholdpolicy-thresholdpercentage): Integer
Properties
ProposalDurationInHours 
The duration from the time that a proposal is created until it expires. If members cast neither the required number of YES votes to approve the proposal nor the number of NO votes required to reject it before the duration expires, the proposal is EXPIRED and ProposalActions are not carried out.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 168
Update requires: No interruption
ThresholdComparator 
Determines whether the vote percentage must be greater than the ThresholdPercentage or must be greater than or equal to the ThreholdPercentage to be approved.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: GREATER_THAN | GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO
Update requires: No interruption
ThresholdPercentage 
The percentage of votes among all members that must be YES for a proposal to be approved. For example, a ThresholdPercentage value of 50 indicates 50%. The ThresholdComparator determines the precise comparison. If a ThresholdPercentage value of 50 is specified on a network with 10 members, along with a ThresholdComparator value of GREATER_THAN, this indicates that 6 YES votes are required for the proposal to be approved.
