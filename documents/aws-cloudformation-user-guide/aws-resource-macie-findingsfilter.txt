AWS::Macie::FindingsFilter
The AWS::Macie::FindingsFilter resource represents an individual findings filter that you create and save to view, analyze, and manage findings. A findings filter is a set of criteria that specifies which findings to include in the results of a query that retrieves findings. A findings filter can also perform specific actions on findings that meet the filter's criteria.
A Session must exist for the account before you can create a FindingsFilter. Use a DependsOn attribute to ensure that the Session is created before the other resources. For example, "DependsOn: Session".
