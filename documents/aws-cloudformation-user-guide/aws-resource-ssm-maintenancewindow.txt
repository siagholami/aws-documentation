AWS::SSM::MaintenanceWindow
The AWS::SSM::MaintenanceWindow resource represents general information about a maintenance window for AWS Systems Manager. Maintenance Windows let you define a schedule for when to perform potentially disruptive actions on your instances, such as patching an operating system (OS), updating drivers, or installing software. Each maintenance window has a schedule, a duration, a set of registered targets, and a set of registered tasks. 
For more information, see Systems Manager Maintenance Windows in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide and  CreateMaintenanceWindow in the AWS Systems Manager API Reference.
