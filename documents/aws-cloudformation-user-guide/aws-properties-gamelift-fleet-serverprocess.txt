AWS::GameLift::Fleet ServerProcess
A set of instructions for launching server processes on each instance in a fleet. Each instruction set identifies the location of the server executable, optional launch parameters, and the number of server processes with this configuration to maintain concurrently on the instance. Server process configurations make up a fleet's RuntimeConfiguration.
