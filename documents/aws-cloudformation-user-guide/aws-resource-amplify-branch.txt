EnablePullRequestPreview 
Sets whether the Amplify Console creates a preview for each pull request that is made for this branch. If this property is enabled, the Amplify Console deploys your app to a unique preview URL after each pull request is opened. Development and QA teams can use this preview to test the pull request before it's merged into a production or integration branch.
To provide backend support for your preview, the Amplify Console automatically provisions a temporary backend environment that it deletes when the pull request is closed. If you want to specify a dedicated backend environment for your previews, use the PullRequestEnvironmentName property.
For more information, see Web Previews in the AWS Amplify Console User Guide.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
EnvironmentVariables 
 The environment variables for the branch. 
Required: No
Type: List of EnvironmentVariable
Update requires: No interruption
PullRequestEnvironmentName 
If pull request previews are enabled for this branch, you can use this property to specify a dedicated backend environment for your previews. For example, you could specify an environment named prod, test, or dev that you initialized with the Amplify CLI and mapped to this branch.
To enable pull request previews, set the EnablePullRequestPreview property to true.
If you don't specify an environment, the Amplify Console provides backend support for each preview by automatically provisioning a temporary backend environment. Amplify Console deletes this environment when the pull request is closed.
For more information about creating backend environments, see Feature Branch Deployments and Team Workflows in the AWS Amplify Console User Guide.
