Properties
AllocationStrategy 
Indicates how to allocate the target Spot Instance capacity across the Spot Instance pools specified by the Spot Fleet request.
If the allocation strategy is lowestPrice, Spot Fleet launches instances from the Spot Instance pools with the lowest price. This is the default allocation strategy.
If the allocation strategy is diversified, Spot Fleet launches instances from all the Spot Instance pools that you specify.
If the allocation strategy is capacityOptimized, Spot Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: capacityOptimized | diversified | lowestPrice
Update requires: Replacement
ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy 
Indicates whether running Spot Instances should be terminated if you decrease the target capacity of the Spot Fleet request below the current size of the Spot Fleet.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: default | noTermination
Update requires: No interruption
IamFleetRole 
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants the Spot Fleet the permission to request, launch, terminate, and tag instances on your behalf. For more information, see Spot Fleet Prerequisites in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. Spot Fleet can terminate Spot Instances on your behalf when you cancel its Spot Fleet request or when the Spot Fleet request expires, if you set TerminateInstancesWithExpiration.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
InstanceInterruptionBehavior 
The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. The default is terminate.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: hibernate | stop | terminate
Update requires: Replacement
LaunchSpecifications 
The launch specifications for the Spot Fleet request. If you specify LaunchSpecifications, you can't specify LaunchTemplateConfigs.
Required: Conditional
Type: List of SpotFleetLaunchSpecification
Update requires: Replacement
LaunchTemplateConfigs 
The launch template and overrides. If you specify LaunchTemplateConfigs, you can't specify LaunchSpecifications.
Required: Conditional
Type: List of LaunchTemplateConfig
Update requires: Replacement
LoadBalancersConfig 
One or more Classic Load Balancers and target groups to attach to the Spot Fleet request. Spot Fleet registers the running Spot Instances with the specified Classic Load Balancers and target groups.
With Network Load Balancers, Spot Fleet cannot register instances that have the following instance types: C1, CC1, CC2, CG1, CG2, CR1, CS1, G1, G2, HI1, HS1, M1, M2, M3, and T1.
Required: No
Type: LoadBalancersConfig
Update requires: Replacement
ReplaceUnhealthyInstances 
Indicates whether Spot Fleet should replace unhealthy instances.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: Replacement
SpotPrice 
The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. The default is the On-Demand price.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
TargetCapacity 
The number of units to request for the Spot Fleet. You can choose to set the target capacity in terms of instances or a performance characteristic that is important to your application workload, such as vCPUs, memory, or I/O. If the request type is maintain, you can specify a target capacity of 0 and add capacity later.
Required: Yes
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
TerminateInstancesWithExpiration 
Indicates whether running Spot Instances are terminated when the Spot Fleet request expires.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: Replacement
Type 
The type of request. Indicates whether the Spot Fleet only requests the target capacity or also attempts to maintain it. When this value is request, the Spot Fleet only places the required requests. It does not attempt to replenish Spot Instances if capacity is diminished, nor does it submit requests in alternative Spot pools if capacity is not available. When this value is maintain, the Spot Fleet maintains the target capacity. The Spot Fleet places the required requests to meet capacity and automatically replenishes any interrupted instances. Default: maintain. instant is listed but is not used by Spot Fleet.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: instant | maintain | request
Update requires: Replacement
ValidFrom 
The start date and time of the request, in UTC format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). By default, Amazon EC2 starts fulfilling the request immediately.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
ValidUntil 
The end date and time of the request, in UTC format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). After the end date and time, no new Spot Instance requests are placed or able to fulfill the request. If no value is specified, the Spot Fleet request remains until you cancel it.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
