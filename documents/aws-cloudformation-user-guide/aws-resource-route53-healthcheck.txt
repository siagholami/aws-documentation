AWS::Route53::HealthCheck
The AWS::Route53::HealthCheck resource is a Route 53 resource type that contains settings for a Route 53 health check.
For information about associating health checks with records, see HealthCheckId in ChangeResourceRecordSets. 
ELB Load Balancers
If you're registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances. When you register an EC2 instance with a load balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a similar function to a Route 53 health check.
Private Hosted Zones
You can associate health checks with failover records in a private hosted zone. Note the following:
 Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC.
 You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server.
 You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 StatusCheckFailed metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the CloudWatch console, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
