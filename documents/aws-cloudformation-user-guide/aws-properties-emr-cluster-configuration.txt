AWS::EMR::InstanceGroupConfig Configuration
Configurations is a property of the AWS::EMR::Cluster resource that specifies the configuration of applications on an Amazon EMR cluster.
Configurations are optional. You can use them to have EMR customize applications and software bundled with Amazon EMR when a cluster is created. A configuration consists of a classification, properties, and optional nested configurations. A classification refers to an application-specific configuration file. Properties are the settings you want to change in that file. For more information, see Configuring Applications.
Note
Applies only to Amazon EMR releases 4.0 and later.
