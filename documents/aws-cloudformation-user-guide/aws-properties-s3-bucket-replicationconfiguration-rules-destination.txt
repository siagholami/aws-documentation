Properties
AccessControlTranslation 
Specify this only in a cross-account scenario (where source and destination bucket owners are not the same), and you want to change replica ownership to the AWS account that owns the destination bucket. If this is not specified in the replication configuration, the replicas are owned by same AWS account that owns the source object.
Required: No
Type: AccessControlTranslation
Update requires: No interruption
Account 
Destination bucket owner account ID. In a cross-account scenario, if you direct Amazon S3 to change replica ownership to the AWS account that owns the destination bucket by specifying the AccessControlTranslation property, this is the account ID of the destination bucket owner. For more information, see Cross-Region Replication Additional Configuration: Change Replica Owner in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
If you specify the AccessControlTranslation property, the Account property is required. 
Required: Conditional
Type: String

Bucket 
 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to store the results.

StorageClass 
 The storage class to use when replicating objects, such as S3 Standard or reduced redundancy. By default, Amazon S3 uses the storage class of the source object to create the object replica. 
For valid values, see the StorageClass element of the PUT Bucket replication action in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference.
