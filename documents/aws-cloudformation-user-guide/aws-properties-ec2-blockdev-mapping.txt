AWS::EC2::Instance BlockDeviceMapping
Specifies a block device mapping for an instance.
BlockDeviceMapping is a property of the AWS::EC2::Instance resource.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "[DeviceName](#cfn-ec2-blockdev-mapping-devicename)" : String,
  "[Ebs](#cfn-ec2-blockdev-mapping-ebs)" : Ebs,
  "[NoDevice](#cfn-ec2-blockdev-mapping-nodevice)" : NoDevice,
  "[VirtualName](#cfn-ec2-blockdev-mapping-virtualname)" : String
}
YAML
[DeviceName](#cfn-ec2-blockdev-mapping-devicename): String
  [Ebs](#cfn-ec2-blockdev-mapping-ebs): 
    Ebs
  [NoDevice](#cfn-ec2-blockdev-mapping-nodevice): 
    NoDevice
  [VirtualName](#cfn-ec2-blockdev-mapping-virtualname): String
Properties
DeviceName 
The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh).
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Ebs 
Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.
You can specify either VirtualName or Ebs, but not both.
Required: Conditional
Type: Ebs
Update requires: No interruption
NoDevice 
Suppresses the specified device included in the block device mapping of the AMI.
Required: No
Type: NoDevice
Update requires: No interruption
VirtualName 
The virtual device name (ephemeralN). The name must be in the form ephemeralX where X is a number starting from zero (0). For example, an instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1. The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.
NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.
You can specify either VirtualName or Ebs, but not both.
Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.
Required: Conditional
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Examples
Block Device Mapping with two EBS Volumes
This example sets the EBS-backed root device (/dev/sda1) size to 50 GiB, and another EBS-backed device mapped to /dev/sdm that is 100 GiB in size.
JSON
"BlockDeviceMappings" : [
   {
      "DeviceName" : "/dev/sda1",
      "Ebs" : { "VolumeSize" : "50" }
   },
   {
      "DeviceName" : "/dev/sdm",
      "Ebs" : { "VolumeSize" : "100" }
   }
]
YAML
BlockDeviceMappings:
  - DeviceName: /dev/sda1
    Ebs:
      VolumeSize: 50
  - DeviceName: /dev/sdm
    Ebs:
      VolumeSize: 100
Block Device Mapping with an Ephemeral Drive
This example maps an ephemeral drive to device /dev/sdc.
JSON
"BlockDeviceMappings" : [
   {
      "DeviceName"  : "/dev/sdc",
      "VirtualName" : "ephemeral0"
   }
]
YAML
BlockDeviceMappings:
  - DeviceName: /dev/sdc
    VirtualName: ephemeral0
Unmapping an AMI-defined Device
To unmap a device defined in the AMI, set the NoDevice property to an empty map, as shown here:
JSON
"BlockDeviceMappings" : [
   {
      "DeviceName":"/dev/sde",
      "NoDevice": {}
   }
]
YAML
BlockDeviceMappings:
  - DeviceName: /dev/sde
    NoDevice: {}
