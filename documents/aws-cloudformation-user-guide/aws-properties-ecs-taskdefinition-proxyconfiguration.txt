AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition ProxyConfiguration
The ProxyConfiguration property specifies the details for the App Mesh proxy.
For tasks using the EC2 launch type, the container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent and at least version 1.26.0-1 of the ecs-init package to enable a proxy configuration. If your container instances are launched from the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI version 20190301 or later, then they contain the required versions of the container agent and ecs-init. For more information, see Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires platform version 1.3.0 or later.

ProxyConfigurationProperties 
The set of network configuration parameters to provide the Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin, specified as key-value pairs.
