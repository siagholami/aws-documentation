AWS::Pinpoint::ADMChannel
A channel is a type of platform that you can deliver messages to. You can use the ADM channel to send push notifications through the Amazon Device Messaging (ADM) service to apps that run on Amazon devices, such as Kindle Fire tablets. Before you can use Amazon Pinpoint to send messages to Amazon devices, you have to enable the ADM channel for an Amazon Pinpoint application.
The AWS::Pinpoint::ADMChannel resource defines the status and authentication settings of the ADM channel for an application.
