Enable trusted access with AWS Organizations
To set up the required permissions to create a stack set with self-managed permissions, see Grant self-managed permissions.
Before you create a stack set with service-managed permissions, you must first complete the following tasks:
 Enable all features in AWS Organizations. With only consolidated billing features enabled, you cannot create a stack set with service-managed permissions.
 Enable trusted access with AWS Organizations. After trusted access is enabled, StackSets creates the necessary IAM roles in the administrator (AWS Organizations master) account and target accounts when you create stack sets with service-managed permissions.
Note
The IAM service-linked role created in the organization master account has the suffix CloudFormationStackSetsOrgAdmin. You can modify or delete this role only if trusted access with AWS Organizations is disabled. The IAM service-linked role created in each target account has the suffix CloudFormationStackSetsOrgMember. You can modify or delete this role only if trusted access with AWS Organizations is disabled, or if the account is removed from the target organization or organizational unit (OU).
This topic describes how to enable trusted access with AWS Organizations.
Only an account administrator in an AWS Organizations master account has permissions to enable trusted access. An administrator user is an IAM user with full permissions to your AWS account. For more information, see IAM best practices and Creating your first IAM admin user and group in the IAM User Guide.
To enable trusted access in the Create StackSet wizard:
See Create a stack set with service-managed permissions.
To enable trusted access in the StackSets page of the AWS CloudFormation console:

Determine which AWS account is the administrator account. For stack sets with service-managed permissions, the administrator account is an AWS Organizations master account.

Stack sets are created in this administrator (master) account. A target account is the account to which stack instances are deployed.


Sign in to AWS as an administrator of the master account and open the AWS CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.


From the navigation pane, choose StackSets. If trusted access is disabled, a banner displays that prompts you to enable trusted access.



Choose Enable trusted access.


Trusted access is successfully enabled when the following banner displays.

To enable trusted access in the Trusted access for AWS services page of the AWS Organizations console:
See AWS CloudFormation StackSets and AWS Organizations in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
To disable trusted access:
See AWS CloudFormation StackSets and AWS Organizations in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
