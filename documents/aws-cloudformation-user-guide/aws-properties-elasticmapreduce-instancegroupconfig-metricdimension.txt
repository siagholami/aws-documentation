AWS::EMR::InstanceGroupConfig MetricDimension
MetricDimension is a subproperty of the CloudWatchAlarmDefinition property type. MetricDimension specifies a CloudWatch dimension, which is specified with a Key Value pair. The key is known as a Name in CloudWatch. By default, Amazon EMR uses one dimension whose Key is JobFlowID and Value is a variable representing the cluster ID, which is ${emr.clusterId}. This enables the automatic scaling rule for EMR to bootstrap when the cluster ID becomes available during cluster creation.
