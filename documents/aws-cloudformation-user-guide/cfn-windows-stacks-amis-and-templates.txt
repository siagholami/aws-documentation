Microsoft Windows Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and AWS CloudFormation templates
With AWS CloudFormation, you can create Microsoft Windows stacks for running Windows server instances. A number of pre-configured templates are available to launch directly from the AWS CloudFormation sample templates page, such as the following templates:
 Windows_Single_Server_SharePoint_Foundation.template - SharePoint速 Foundation 2010 running on Microsoft Windows Server速 2008 R2
 Windows_Single_Server_Active_Directory.template - Create a single server installation of Active Directory running on Microsoft Windows Server速 2008 R2.
 Windows_Roles_And_Features.template - Create a single server specifying server roles running on Microsoft Windows Server速 2008 R2.
 ElasticBeanstalk_Windows_Sample.template - Launch an AWS Elastic Beanstalk sample application on Windows Server 2008 R2 running IIS 7.5.

Although these stacks are already configured, you can use any EC2 Windows AMI as the basis of an AWS CloudFormation Windows stack.
