AWS::Greengrass::FunctionDefinitionVersion RunAs
The user and group permissions used to run the Lambda function. This setting overrides the default access identity that's specified for the group (by default, ggc_user and ggc_group). You can override the user, group, or both. For more information, see Run as in the AWS IoT Greengrass Developer Guide.
Important
Running as the root user increases risks to your data and device. Do not run as root (UID/GID=0) unless your business case requires it. For more information and requirements, see Running a Lambda Function as Root. 
 In an AWS CloudFormation template, RunAs is a property of the  Execution  property type.
