[Bandwidth](#cfn-medialive-channel-hlsinputsettings-bandwidth): Integer
  [BufferSegments](#cfn-medialive-channel-hlsinputsettings-buffersegments): Integer
  [Retries](#cfn-medialive-channel-hlsinputsettings-retries): Integer
  [RetryInterval](#cfn-medialive-channel-hlsinputsettings-retryinterval): Integer
Properties
Bandwidth 
When specified, the HLS stream with the m3u8 BANDWIDTH that most closely matches this value is chosen. Otherwise, the highest bandwidth stream in the m3u8 is chosen. The bitrate is specified in bits per second, as in an HLS manifest.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
BufferSegments 
When specified, reading of the HLS input begins this many buffer segments from the end (most recently written segment). When not specified, the HLS input begins with the first segment specified in the m3u8.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
Retries 
The number of consecutive times that attempts to read a manifest or segment must fail before the input is considered unavailable.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
RetryInterval 
The number of seconds between retries when an attempt to read a manifest or segment fails.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Update requires: No interruption
