AWS::EMR::InstanceFleetConfig
Use InstanceFleetConfig to define instance fleets for an EMR cluster. A cluster can not use both instance fleets and instance groups. For more information, see Configure Instance Fleets in the Amazon EMR Management Guide. 
Note
The instance fleet configuration is available only in Amazon EMR versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions.

Properties
ClusterId 
The unique identifier of the EMR cluster.
Required: Yes
Type: String

InstanceFleetType 
The node type that the instance fleet hosts. Valid values are MASTER,CORE,and TASK.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Allowed values: CORE | MASTER | TASK

InstanceTypeConfigs 
InstanceTypeConfigs determine the EC2 instances that Amazon EMR attempts to provision to fulfill On-Demand and Spot target capacities. There can be a maximum of 5 instance type configurations in a fleet, each one specified using an InstanceTypeConfig.
The instance fleet configuration is available only in Amazon EMR versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions.
Required: No
Type: List of InstanceTypeConfig
Update requires: Replacement
LaunchSpecifications 
The launch specification for the instance fleet.
Required: No
Type: InstanceFleetProvisioningSpecifications
Update requires: Replacement
Name 
The friendly name of the instance fleet.
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 0
Maximum: 256

TargetOnDemandCapacity 
The target capacity of On-Demand units for the instance fleet, which determines how many On-Demand instances to provision. When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision On-Demand instances as specified by InstanceTypeConfig. Each instance configuration has a specified WeightedCapacity. When an On-Demand instance is provisioned, the WeightedCapacity units count toward the target capacity. Amazon EMR provisions instances until the target capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EMR can only provision an instance with a WeightedCapacity of 5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the target capacity is exceeded by 3 units.
If not specified or set to 0, only Spot instances are provisioned for the instance fleet using TargetSpotCapacity. At least one of TargetSpotCapacity and TargetOnDemandCapacity should be greater than 0. For a master instance fleet, only one of TargetSpotCapacity and TargetOnDemandCapacity can be specified, and its value must be 1.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Minimum: 0
Update requires: No interruption
TargetSpotCapacity 
The target capacity of Spot units for the instance fleet, which determines how many Spot instances to provision. When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision Spot instances as specified by InstanceTypeConfig. Each instance configuration has a specified WeightedCapacity. When a Spot instance is provisioned, the WeightedCapacity units count toward the target capacity. Amazon EMR provisions instances until the target capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EMR can only provision an instance with a WeightedCapacity of 5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the target capacity is exceeded by 3 units.
If not specified or set to 0, only On-Demand instances are provisioned for the instance fleet. At least one of TargetSpotCapacity and TargetOnDemandCapacity should be greater than 0. For a master instance fleet, only one of TargetSpotCapacity and TargetOnDemandCapacity can be specified, and its value must be 1.

Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the ID of the instance fleet.
