AWS::EC2::SubnetNetworkAclAssociation
Associates a subnet with a network ACL. For more information, see ReplaceNetworkAclAssociation in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference.
When AWS::EC2::SubnetNetworkAclAssociation resources are created during create or update operations, AWS CloudFormation adopts existing resources that share the same key properties (the properties that contribute to uniquely identify the resource). However, if the operation fails and rolls back, AWS CloudFormation deletes the previously out-of-band resources. You can protect against this behavior by using Retain deletion policies. For more information, see DeletionPolicy Attribute.
