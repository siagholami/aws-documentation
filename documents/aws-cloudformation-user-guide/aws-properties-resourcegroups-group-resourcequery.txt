The valid types are TAG_FILTERS_1_0 and CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0. Each type requires specific attributes for the Query object:
 TAG_FILTERS_1_0 indicates that the group is a tag-based group. Group membership is defined by the query's TagFilters property. Specify the tag filters to use in the query.
 CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0, the default, indicates that the group is a CloudFormation stack-based group. Group membership is based on the CloudFormation stack. Specify the StackIdentifier property in the query to define which stack to associate the group with, or leave it empty to default to the stack where the group is defined.
