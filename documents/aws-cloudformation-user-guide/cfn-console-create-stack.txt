Creating a stack on the AWS CloudFormation console
Before you create a stack, you must have a template that describes what resources AWS CloudFormation will include in your stack. For more information, see Working with AWS CloudFormation templates.
Note
To preview the configuration of a new stack, you can use a change set.
Creating a stack on the AWS CloudFormation console is an easy, wizard-driven process that consists of the following steps:


Starting the Create Stack wizard


Selecting a stack template


Specifying stack parameters


Setting AWS CloudFormation stack options


Reviewing your stack


After creating a stack, you can monitor the stack's progress, view the stack's resources and outputs, update the stack, and delete it. Information about these actions are provided in their associated topics.
