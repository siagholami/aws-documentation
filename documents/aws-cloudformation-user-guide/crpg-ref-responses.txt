Custom resource response objects
Custom resource provider response fields
The following are properties that the custom resource provider includes when it sends the JSON file to the presigned URL. For more information about uploading objects by using presigned URLs, see the related topic in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
Note
The total size of the response body cannot exceed 4096 bytes. 
Status  
The status value sent by the custom resource provider in response to an AWS CloudFormation-generated request.
Must be either SUCCESS or FAILED.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Reason  
Describes the reason for a failure response.
Required: Required if Status is FAILED. It's optional otherwise.
Type: String
PhysicalResourceId  
This value should be an identifier unique to the custom resource vendor, and can be up to 1 Kb in size. The value must be a non-empty string and must be identical for all responses for the same resource.
Required: Yes
Type: String
StackId  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the stack that contains the custom resource. This response value should be copied verbatim from the request.
Required: Yes
Type: String
RequestId  
A unique ID for the request. This response value should be copied verbatim from the request.
Required: Yes
Type: String
LogicalResourceId  
The template developer-chosen name (logical ID) of the custom resource in the AWS CloudFormation template. This response value should be copied verbatim from the request.
Required: Yes
Type: String
NoEcho  
Optional. Indicates whether to mask the output of the custom resource when retrieved by using the Fn::GetAtt function. If set to true, all returned values are masked with asterisks (*****), except for those stored in the Metadata section of the template. CloudFormation does not transform, modify, or redact any information you include in the Metadata section. The default value is false.
For more information about using NoEcho to mask sensitive information, see the Do not embed credentials in your templates best practice.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Data  
Optional. The custom resource provider-defined name-value pairs to send with the response. You can access the values provided here by name in the template with Fn::GetAtt.
If the name-value pairs contain sensitive information, you should use the NoEcho field to mask the output of the custom resource. Otherwise, the values are visible through APIs that surface property values (such as DescribeStackEvents).
Required: No
Type: JSON object
