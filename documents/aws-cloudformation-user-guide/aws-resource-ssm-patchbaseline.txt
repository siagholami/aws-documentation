Properties
ApprovalRules 
A set of rules used to include patches in the baseline.
Required: No
Type: RuleGroup
Update requires: No interruption
ApprovedPatches 
A list of explicitly approved patches for the baseline.
For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches and rejected patches, see About package name formats for approved and rejected patch lists in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Maximum: 50
Update requires: No interruption
ApprovedPatchesComplianceLevel 
Defines the compliance level for approved patches. This means that if an approved patch is reported as missing, this is the severity of the compliance violation. The default value is UNSPECIFIED.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: CRITICAL | HIGH | INFORMATIONAL | LOW | MEDIUM | UNSPECIFIED
Update requires: No interruption
ApprovedPatchesEnableNonSecurity 
Indicates whether the list of approved patches includes non-security updates that should be applied to the instances. The default value is 'false'. Applies to Linux instances only.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
Description 
A description of the patch baseline.
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 1024
Update requires: No interruption
GlobalFilters 
A set of global filters used to include patches in the baseline.
Required: No
Type: PatchFilterGroup
Update requires: No interruption
Name 
The name of the patch baseline.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 3
Maximum: 128
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]{3,128}$
Update requires: No interruption
OperatingSystem 
Defines the operating system the patch baseline applies to. The Default value is WINDOWS. 
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: AMAZON_LINUX | AMAZON_LINUX_2 | CENTOS | DEBIAN | ORACLE_LINUX | REDHAT_ENTERPRISE_LINUX | SUSE | UBUNTU | WINDOWS
Update requires: Replacement
PatchGroups 
The name of the patch group that should be registered with the patch baseline.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 256
Pattern: ^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=\-@]*)$
Update requires: No interruption
RejectedPatches 
A list of explicitly rejected patches for the baseline.
For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches and rejected patches, see About package name formats for approved and rejected patch lists in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Maximum: 50
Update requires: No interruption
RejectedPatchesAction 
The action for Patch Manager to take on patches included in the RejectedPackages list.
  ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY: A package in the Rejected patches list is installed only if it is a dependency of another package. It is considered compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is reported as InstalledOther. This is the default action if no option is specified.
  BLOCK: Packages in the RejectedPatches list, and packages that include them as dependencies, are not installed under any circumstances. If a package was installed before it was added to the Rejected patches list, it is considered non-compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is reported as InstalledRejected.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY | BLOCK
Update requires: No interruption
Sources 
Information about the patches to use to update the instances, including target operating systems and source repositories. Applies to Linux instances only.
Required: No
Type: List of PatchSource
Maximum: 20
Update requires: No interruption
Tags 
Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag a patch baseline to identify the severity level of patches it specifies and the operating system family it applies to.
Required: No
Type: List of Tag
Maximum: 1000
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the patch baseline ID, such as pb-abcde1234567890yz.
Note
The ID of the default patch baseline provided by AWS is an ARN, for example arn:aws:ssm:us-west-2:123456789012:patchbaseline/abcde1234567890yz.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Examples
AWS Systems Manager Patch Baseline Example
The following example creates a Systems Manager patch baseline that approves patches for Windows Server 2019 instances seven days after they are released by Microsoft. The patch baseline also approves patches for Active Directory seven days after they are released by Microsoft.
