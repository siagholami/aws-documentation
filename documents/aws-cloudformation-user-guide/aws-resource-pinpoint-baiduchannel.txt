AWS::Pinpoint::BaiduChannel
A channel is a type of platform that you can deliver messages to. You can use the Baidu channel to send notifications to the Baidu Cloud Push notification service. Before you can use Amazon Pinpoint to send notifications to the Baidu Cloud Push service, you have to enable the Baidu channel for an Amazon Pinpoint application.
The AWS::Pinpoint::BaiduChannel resource defines the status and authentication settings of the Baidu channel for an application.
