Canceling a stack update
After a stack update has begun, you can cancel the stack update if the stack is still in the UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS state. After an update has finished, you cannot cancel it. You can, however, update a stack again with any previous settings.
If you cancel a stack update, the stack is rolled back to the stack configuration that existed prior to initiating the stack update.
