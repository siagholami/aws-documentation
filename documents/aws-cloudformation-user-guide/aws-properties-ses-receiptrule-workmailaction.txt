AWS::SES::ReceiptRule WorkmailAction
When included in a receipt rule, this action calls Amazon WorkMail and, optionally, publishes a notification to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). It usually isn't necessary to use this action directly, because Amazon WorkMail adds the rule automatically during its setup procedure.
For information using a receipt rule to call Amazon WorkMail, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide.
