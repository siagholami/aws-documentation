ServerSideTokenCheck 
TRUE if server-side token validation is enabled for the identity providerâ€™s token.
After you set the ServerSideTokenCheck to TRUE for an identity pool, that identity pool checks with the integrated user pools to make sure the user has not been globally signed out or deleted before the identity pool provides an OIDC token or AWS credentials for the user.
If the user is signed out or deleted, the identity pool returns a 400 Not Authorized error.
