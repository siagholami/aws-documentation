Properties
AllQueryArguments 
Inspect all query arguments. 
Required: No
Type: Json
Update requires: No interruption
Body 
Inspect the request body, which immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. 
Note that only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. If you don't need to inspect more than 8 KB, you can guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes in by combining a statement that inspects the body of the web request, such as ByteMatchStatement or RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement, with a SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an 8 KB size limit on the body of the request. AWS WAF doesn't support inspecting the entire contents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.
