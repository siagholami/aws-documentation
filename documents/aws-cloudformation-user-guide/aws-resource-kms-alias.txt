AWS::KMS::Alias
The AWS::KMS::Alias resource specifies a display name for a customer master key (CMK) in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). You can use an alias to identify a CMK in the AWS KMS console, in the DescribeKey operation and in cryptographic operations, such as Decrypt and GenerateDataKey.
Using an alias to refer to a CMK can help you simplify key management. For example, an alias in your code can map to different CMKs in different AWS Regions. For more information, see Using aliases in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
When specifying an alias, observe the following rules.
 Each alias can point to only one CMK, but multiple aliases can point to the same CMK.
 The alias and the CMK it points to must be in the same AWS account and Region.
 The alias name must be unique in the AWS account and Region. However, you can create aliases with the same name in different AWS Regions. For example, you can have an alias/projectKey in multiple Regions, each of which points to a CMK in that Region.
 Each alias name must begin with alias/ followed by a name, such as alias/exampleKey. The alias name can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). Alias names cannot begin with alias/aws/. That alias name prefix is reserved for AWS managed CMKs.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::KMS::Alias",
  "Properties" : {
      "[AliasName](#cfn-kms-alias-aliasname)" : String,
      "[TargetKeyId](#cfn-kms-alias-targetkeyid)" : String
    }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::KMS::Alias
Properties: 
  [AliasName](#cfn-kms-alias-aliasname): String
  [TargetKeyId](#cfn-kms-alias-targetkeyid): String
Properties
AliasName 
Specifies the alias name. This value must begin with alias/ followed by a name, such as alias/ExampleAlias. 
The alias must be string of 1-256 characters. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with alias/aws/. The alias/aws/ prefix is reserved for AWS managed CMKs.
Pattern: alias/^[a-zA-Z0-9/_-]$
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 256
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
TargetKeyId 
Associates the alias with the specified customer managed CMK. The CMK must be in the same AWS account and Region.
A valid CMK ID is required. If you supply a null or empty string value, this operation returns an error.
For help finding the key ID and ARN, see Finding the Key ID and ARN in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
Specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK.
For example:
 Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab 
 Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab 
To get the key ID and key ARN for a CMK, use ListKeys or DescribeKey.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 2048
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the alias name, such as alias/exampleAlias.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Examples
Create an alias
The following examples create the alias/exampleAlias alias for a CMK. The CMK is identified by referencing its resource name. Before using these examples, replace the example target key ID with a valid value.
JSON
"myAlias" : {
  "Type" : "AWS::KMS::Alias",
  "Properties" : {
    "AliasName" : "alias/exampleAlias",
    "TargetKeyId" : {"Ref": "myKey"}
  }
}
YAML
myAlias:
  Type: AWS::KMS::Alias
  Properties:
    AliasName: alias/exampleAlias
    TargetKeyId:
      Ref: myKey
