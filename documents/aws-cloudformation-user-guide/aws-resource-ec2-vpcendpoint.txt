AWS::EC2::VPCEndpoint
Specifies a VPC endpoint for a service. An endpoint enables you to create a private connection between your VPC and the service. The service may be provided by AWS, an AWS Marketplace partner, or another AWS account. For more information, see VPC Endpoints in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.
A gateway endpoint serves as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined for the AWS service. You can specify an endpoint policy to attach to the endpoint that will control access to the service from your VPC. You can also specify the VPC route tables that use the endpoint.
An interface endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that serves as an endpoint for communicating with the specified service. You can specify the subnets in which to create an endpoint, and the security groups to associate with the endpoint network interface.
For information about connectivity when you use a gateway endpoint to connect to an Amazon S3 bucket from an EC2 instance, see Why canâ€™t I connect to an S3 bucket using a gateway VPC endpoint.

Properties
PolicyDocument 
A policy to attach to the endpoint that controls access to the service. The policy must be in valid JSON format. If this parameter is not specified, we attach a default policy that allows full access to the service.
Required: No
Type: Json
Update requires: No interruption
PrivateDnsEnabled 
(Interface endpoint) Indicate whether to associate a private hosted zone with the specified VPC. The private hosted zone contains a record set for the default public DNS name for the service for the Region (for example, kinesis.us-east-1.amazonaws.com) which resolves to the private IP addresses of the endpoint network interfaces in the VPC. This enables you to make requests to the default public DNS name for the service instead of the public DNS names that are automatically generated by the VPC endpoint service.
To use a private hosted zone, you must set the following VPC attributes to true: enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport.
Default: false
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
RouteTableIds 
(Gateway endpoint) One or more route table IDs.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
SecurityGroupIds 
(Interface endpoint) The ID of one or more security groups to associate with the endpoint network interface.
This field is required when the endpoint is an interface.
Required: Conditional
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
ServiceName 
The service name. To get a list of available services, use the DescribeVpcEndpointServices request, or get the name from the service provider.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
SubnetIds 
(Interface endpoint) The ID of one or more subnets in which to create an endpoint network interface.
This field is required when the endpoint is an interface.
Required: Conditional
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
VpcEndpointType 
The type of endpoint.
Default: Gateway
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: Gateway | Interface
Update requires: Replacement
VpcId 
The ID of the VPC in which the endpoint will be used.
This field is required when the endpoint is an interface.
Required: Conditional
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the ID of the VPC endpoint.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

CreationTimestamp 
The date and time the VPC endpoint was created. For example: Fri Sep 28 23:34:36 UTC 2018.
DnsEntries 
(Interface endpoint) The DNS entries for the endpoint. Each entry is a combination of the hosted zone ID and the DNS name. The entries are ordered as follows: regional public DNS, zonal public DNS, private DNS, and wildcard DNS. This order is not enforced for AWS Marketplace services.
The following is an example. In the first entry, the hosted zone ID is Z1HUB23UULQXV and the DNS name is vpce-01abc23456de78f9g-12abccd3.ec2.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com.
["Z1HUB23UULQXV:vpce-01abc23456de78f9g-12abccd3.ec2.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com", "Z1HUB23UULQXV:vpce-01abc23456de78f9g-12abccd3-us-east-1a.ec2.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com", "Z1C12344VYDITB0:ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"]
If you update the PrivateDnsEnabled or SubnetIds properties, the DNS entries in the list will change.
NetworkInterfaceIds 
(Interface endpoint) One or more network interface IDs. If you update the PrivateDnsEnabled or SubnetIds properties, the items in this list might change.
Examples
VPC Endpoint
The following example specifies a VPC endpoint that allows only the s3:GetObject action on the examplebucket bucket. Traffic to S3 within subnets that are associated with the routetableA and routetableB route tables is automatically routed through the VPC endpoint.
