AWS::DynamoDB::Table Projection
Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into an index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "[NonKeyAttributes](#cfn-dynamodb-projectionobj-nonkeyatt)" : [ String, ... ],
  "[ProjectionType](#cfn-dynamodb-projectionobj-projtype)" : String
}
YAML
[NonKeyAttributes](#cfn-dynamodb-projectionobj-nonkeyatt): 
    - String
  [ProjectionType](#cfn-dynamodb-projectionobj-projtype): String
Properties
NonKeyAttributes 
Represents the non-key attribute names which will be projected into the index.
For local secondary indexes, the total count of NonKeyAttributes summed across all of the local secondary indexes, must not exceed 20. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total.
