AWS::AppConfig::DeploymentStrategy
The AWS::AppConfig::DeploymentStrategy resource creates an AppConfig deployment strategy. A deployment strategy defines important criteria for rolling out your configuration to the designated targets. A deployment strategy includes: the overall duration required, a percentage of targets to receive the deployment during each interval, an algorithm that defines how percentage grows, and bake time.
AppConfig requires that you create resources and deploy a configuration in the following order:


Create an application


Create an environment


Create a configuration profile


Create a deployment strategy


Deploy the configuration


For more information, see AWS AppConfig in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

Properties
DeploymentDurationInMinutes 
Total amount of time for a deployment to last.
Required: Yes
Type: Double
Minimum: 0
Maximum: 1440
Update requires: No interruption
Description 
A description of the deployment strategy.
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 0
Maximum: 1024
Update requires: No interruption
FinalBakeTimeInMinutes 
The amount of time AWS AppConfig monitors for alarms before considering the deployment to be complete and no longer eligible for automatic roll back.
Required: No
Type: Double
Minimum: 0
Maximum: 1440
Update requires: No interruption
GrowthFactor 
The percentage of targets to receive a deployed configuration during each interval.
Required: Yes
Type: Double
Update requires: No interruption
GrowthType 
The algorithm used to define how percentage grows over time. AWS AppConfig supports the following growth types:
Linear: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by dividing the total number of targets by the value specified for Step percentage. For example, a linear deployment that uses a Step percentage of 10 deploys the configuration to 10 percent of the hosts. After those deployments are complete, the system deploys the configuration to the next 10 percent. This continues until 100% of the targets have successfully received the configuration.
Exponential: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment exponentially using the following formula: G*(2^N). In this formula, G is the growth factor specified by the user and N is the number of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as follows:
2*(2^0) 
2*(2^1) 
2*(2^2) 
Expressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the configuration has been deployed to all targets.
Required: No
Type: String
Allowed values: EXPONENTIAL | LINEAR
Update requires: No interruption
Name 
A name for the deployment strategy.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 64
Update requires: Replacement
ReplicateTo 
Save the deployment strategy to a Systems Manager (SSM) document.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Allowed values: NONE | SSM_DOCUMENT
Update requires: Replacement
Tags 
Metadata to assign to an AWS AppConfig resource. Tags help organize and categorize your AWS AppConfig resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. You can specify a maximum of 50 tags for a resource.
Required: No
Type: List of Tags
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the deployment strategy ID.
Examples
AWS AppConfig Deployment Strategy Example
The following example creates an AWS AppConfig deployment strategy called MyTestDeploymentStrategy. A deployment strategy defines how a configuration is deployed.
