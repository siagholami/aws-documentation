AWS::S3::Bucket NoncurrentVersionTransition
Container for the transition rule that describes when noncurrent objects transition to the STANDARD_IA, ONEZONE_IA, INTELLIGENT_TIERING, GLACIER, or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action to request that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object versions to the STANDARD_IA, ONEZONE_IA, INTELLIGENT_TIERING, GLACIER, or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class at a specific period in the object's lifetime.
