Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the resource name. For example:
{ "Ref": "MyProfile" } 
For the AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile resource with the logical ID MyProfile, Ref returns the name of the instance profile.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

Arn 
Returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the instance profile. For example:
{"Fn::GetAtt" : ["MyProfile", "Arn"] } 
This returns a value such as arn:aws:iam::1234567890:instance-profile/MyProfile-ASDNSDLKJ.
