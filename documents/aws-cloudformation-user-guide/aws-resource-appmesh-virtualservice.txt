AWS::AppMesh::VirtualService
Creates a virtual service within a service mesh.
A virtual service is an abstraction of a real service that is provided by a virtual node directly or indirectly by means of a virtual router. Dependent services call your virtual service by its virtualServiceName, and those requests are routed to the virtual node or virtual router that is specified as the provider for the virtual service.
For more information about virtual services, see Virtual services.

Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the resource ARN. For example:
{ "Ref": "myVirtualService" } 
When you pass the logical ID of an AWS::AppMesh::VirtualService resource to the intrinsic Ref function, the function returns the virtual service ARN, such as arn:aws:appmesh:us-east-1:555555555555:virtualService/myVirtualService.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

Arn 
The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the virtual service.
MeshName 
The name of the service mesh that the virtual service resides in.
MeshOwner 
The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that shared the mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see Working with Shared Meshes.
ResourceOwner
