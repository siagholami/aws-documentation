Arguments

You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script consumes, in addition to arguments that AWS Glue itself consumes.
For information about how to specify and consume your own job arguments, see Calling AWS Glue APIs in Python in the AWS Glue Developer Guide.
For information about the key-value pairs that AWS Glue consumes to set up your job, see the Special Parameters Used by AWS Glue topic in the developer guide.
