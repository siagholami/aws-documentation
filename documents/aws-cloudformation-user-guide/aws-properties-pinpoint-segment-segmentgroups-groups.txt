YAML
[Dimensions](#cfn-pinpoint-segment-segmentgroups-groups-dimensions):

Properties
Dimensions 
An array that defines the dimensions for the segment.
Required: No
Type: List of SegmentDimensions
Update requires: No interruption
SourceSegments 
The base segment to build the segment on. A base segment, also referred to as a source segment, defines the initial population of endpoints for a segment. When you add dimensions to a segment, Amazon Pinpoint filters the base segment by using the dimensions that you specify. You can specify more than one dimensional segment or only one imported segment.
Required: No
Type: List of SourceSegments
Update requires: No interruption
SourceType 
Specifies how to handle multiple base segments for the segment. For example, if you specify three base segments for the segment, whether the resulting segment is based on all, any, or none of the base segments.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Type 
Specifies how to handle multiple dimensions for the segment. For example, if you specify three dimensions for the segment, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the dimensions.
Required: No
