EncryptionOption 
Indicates whether Amazon S3 server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS), or client-side encryption with KMS-managed keys (CSE-KMS) is used.
If a query runs in a workgroup and the workgroup overrides client-side settings, then the workgroup's setting for encryption is used. It specifies whether query results must be encrypted, for all queries that run in this workgroup.
