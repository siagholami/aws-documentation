AWS::IAM::User
Creates a new IAM user for your AWS account.
For information about limitations on the number of IAM users you can create, see Limitations on IAM Entities in the IAM User Guide.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::IAM::User",
  "Properties" : {
      "[Groups](#cfn-iam-user-groups)" : [ String, ... ],
      "[LoginProfile](#cfn-iam-user-loginprofile)" : LoginProfile,
      "[ManagedPolicyArns](#cfn-iam-user-managepolicyarns)" : [ String, ... ],
      "[Path](#cfn-iam-user-path)" : String,
      "[PermissionsBoundary](#cfn-iam-user-permissionsboundary)" : String,
      "[Policies](#cfn-iam-user-policies)" : [ Policy, ... ],
      "[Tags](#cfn-iam-user-tags)" : [ [Tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html), ... ],
      "[UserName](#cfn-iam-user-username)" : String
    }
}

    - [Tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html)
  [UserName](#cfn-iam-user-username): String
Properties
Groups 
A list of groups to which you want to add the user.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
LoginProfile 
 Creates a password for the specified user, giving the user the ability to access AWS services through the AWS Management Console. For more information about managing passwords, see Managing Passwords in the IAM User Guide.
Required: No
Type: LoginProfile
Update requires: No interruption
ManagedPolicyArns 
A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to attach to the user.
For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces in the AWS General Reference.
Required: No
Type: List of String
Update requires: No interruption
Path 
 The path for the user name. For more information about paths, see IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide.
This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).
This parameter allows (through its regex pattern) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 512
Pattern: (\u002F)|(\u002F[\u0021-\u007F]\u002F)
Update requires: No interruption
PermissionsBoundary 
The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the user.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Policies 
Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM user. To view AWS::IAM::User snippets, see Declaring an IAM User Resource.
The name of each policy for a role, user, or group must be unique. If you don't choose unique names, updates to the IAM identity will fail. 
For information about limits on the number of inline policies that you can embed in a user, see Limitations on IAM Entities in the IAM User Guide.
Required: No
Type: List of Policy
Update requires: No interruption
Tags 
A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created user. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM Identities in the IAM User Guide.
If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed number of tags per user, then the entire request fails and the user is not created.
Required: No
Type: List of Tag
Maximum: 50
Update requires: No interruption
UserName 
The name of the user to create. Do not include the path in this value.
This parameter allows (per its regex pattern) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _=,.@-. The user name must be unique within the account. User names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create users named both "John" and "john".
If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the user name.
If you specify a name, you must specify the CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM value to acknowledge your template's capabilities. For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates.
Naming an IAM resource can cause an unrecoverable error if you reuse the same template in multiple Regions. To prevent this, we recommend using Fn::Join and AWS::Region to create a Region-specific name, as in the following example: {"Fn::Join": ["", [{"Ref": "AWS::Region"}, {"Ref": "MyResourceName"}]]}.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the UserName. For example: mystack-myuser-1CCXAFG2H2U4D.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

Arn 
Returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the specified AWS::IAM::User resource. For example: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mystack-myuser-1CCXAFG2H2U4D.
Examples
User
In this example, create a user named "MyUser".
