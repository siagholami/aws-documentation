Name 
For blue/green deployments, the name of the load balancer that is used to route traffic from original instances to replacement instances in a blue/green deployment. For in-place deployments, the name of the load balancer that instances are deregistered from so they are not serving traffic during a deployment, and then re-registered with after the deployment is complete.
