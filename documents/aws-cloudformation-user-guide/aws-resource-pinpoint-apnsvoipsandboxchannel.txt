AWS::Pinpoint::APNSVoipSandboxChannel
A channel is a type of platform that you can deliver messages to. You can use the APNs VoIP sandbox channel to send VoIP notification messages to the sandbox environment of the Apple Push Notification service (APNs). Before you can use Amazon Pinpoint to send VoIP notifications to the APNs sandbox environment, you have to enable the APNs VoIP sandbox channel for an Amazon Pinpoint application.
The AWS::Pinpoint::APNSVoipSandboxChannel resource defines the status and authentication settings of the APNs VoIP sandbox channel for an application.
