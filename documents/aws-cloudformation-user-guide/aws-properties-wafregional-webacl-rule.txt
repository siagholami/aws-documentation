AWS::WAFRegional::WebACL Rule
A combination of ByteMatchSet, IPSet, and/or SqlInjectionMatchSet objects that identify the web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. For example, you might create a Rule that includes the following predicates:
 An IPSet that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests that originate from the IP address 192.0.2.44 
 A ByteMatchSet that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests for which the value of the User-Agent header is BadBot.
To match the settings in this Rule, a request must originate from 192.0.2.44 AND include a User-Agent header for which the value is BadBot.
