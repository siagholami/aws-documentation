AWS::AppMesh::Mesh
Creates a service mesh.
A service mesh is a logical boundary for network traffic between services that are represented by resources within the mesh. After you create your service mesh, you can create virtual services, virtual nodes, virtual routers, and routes to distribute traffic between the applications in your mesh.
For more information about service meshes, see Service meshes.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::AppMesh::Mesh",
  "Properties" : {
      "[MeshName](#cfn-appmesh-mesh-meshname)" : String,
      "[Spec](#cfn-appmesh-mesh-spec)" : MeshSpec,
      "[Tags](#cfn-appmesh-mesh-tags)" : [ [Tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html), ... ]
    }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::AppMesh::Mesh
Properties: 
  [MeshName](#cfn-appmesh-mesh-meshname): String
  [Spec](#cfn-appmesh-mesh-spec): 
    MeshSpec
  [Tags](#cfn-appmesh-mesh-tags): 
    - [Tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html)
Properties
MeshName 
The name to use for the service mesh.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
Spec 
The service mesh specification to apply.
Required: No
Type: MeshSpec
Update requires: No interruption
Tags 
Optional metadata that you can apply to the service mesh to assist with categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.
Required: No
Type: List of Tag
Update requires: No interruption
Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the resource ARN. For example:
{ "Ref": "myMesh" } 
When you pass the logical ID of an AWS::AppMesh::Mesh resource to the intrinsic Ref function, the function returns the mesh ARN, such as arn:aws:appmesh:us-east-1:555555555555:mesh/myMesh.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Fn::GetAtt
The Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.
For more information about using the Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, see Fn::GetAtt.

Arn 
The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the mesh.
MeshName 
The name of the service mesh.
MeshOwner 
The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that shared the mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see Working with Shared Meshes.
ResourceOwner 
The AWS IAM account ID of the resource owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the mesh owner or of another account that the mesh is shared with. For more information about mesh sharing, see Working with Shared Meshes.
Uid 
The unique identifier for the mesh.
Examples
Create a Service Mesh
This example creates a service mesh that allows all egress traffic.
