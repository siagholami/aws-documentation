AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter
The AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter resource specifies a subscription filter and associates it with the specified log group. Subscription filters allow you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log events and have them delivered to a specific destination. Currently, the supported destinations are:
 An Amazon Kinesis data stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
 A logical destination that belongs to a different account, for cross-account delivery.
 An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
 An AWS Lambda function that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
There can only be one subscription filter associated with a log group.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "Type" : "AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter",
  "Properties" : {
      "[DestinationArn](#cfn-cwl-subscriptionfilter-destinationarn)" : String,
      "[FilterPattern](#cfn-cwl-subscriptionfilter-filterpattern)" : String,
      "[LogGroupName](#cfn-cwl-subscriptionfilter-loggroupname)" : String,
      "[RoleArn](#cfn-cwl-subscriptionfilter-rolearn)" : String
    }
}
YAML
Type: AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter
Properties: 
  [DestinationArn](#cfn-cwl-subscriptionfilter-destinationarn): String
  [FilterPattern](#cfn-cwl-subscriptionfilter-filterpattern): String
  [LogGroupName](#cfn-cwl-subscriptionfilter-loggroupname): String
  [RoleArn](#cfn-cwl-subscriptionfilter-rolearn): String
Properties
DestinationArn 
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Update requires: Replacement
FilterPattern 
The filtering expressions that restrict what gets delivered to the destination AWS resource. For more information about the filter pattern syntax, see Filter and Pattern Syntax. 
Required: Yes
Type: String
Update requires: Replacement
LogGroupName 
The log group to associate with the subscription filter. All log events that are uploaded to this log group are filtered and delivered to the specified AWS resource if the filter pattern matches the log events. 
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 512
Pattern: [\.\-_/#A-Za-z0-9]
Update requires: Replacement
RoleArn

Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 1

Return values
Ref
When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic Ref function, Ref returns the resource name.
For more information about using the Ref function, see Ref.
Examples
Create a Subscription Filter
The following example sends log events that are associated with the Root user to a Kinesis data stream.

"SubscriptionFilter" : {
  "Type" : "AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter",
  "Properties" : {
    "RoleArn" : { "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "CloudWatchIAMRole", "Arn" ] },
    "LogGroupName" : { "Ref" : "LogGroup" },
    "FilterPattern" : "{$.userIdentity.type = Root}",
    "DestinationArn" : { "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "KinesisStream", "Arn" ] }
  }
}
