AWS::GuardDuty::Member
You can use the AWS::GuardDuty::Member resource to add an AWS account as a GuardDuty member account to the current GuardDuty master account. If the value of the Status property is not provided or is set to Created, a member account is created but not invited. If the value of the Status property is set to Invited, a member account is created and invited. An AWS::GuardDuty::Member resource must be created with the Status property set to Invited before the AWS::GuardDuty::Master resource can be created in a GuardDuty member account.
