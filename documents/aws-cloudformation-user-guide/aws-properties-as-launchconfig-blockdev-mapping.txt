AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration BlockDeviceMapping
BlockDeviceMapping is a property of AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration that describes a block device mapping for an Auto Scaling group.
Each instance that is launched has an associated root device volume, either an Amazon EBS volume or an instance store volume. You can use block device mappings to specify additional EBS volumes or instance store volumes to attach to an instance when it is launched. 
For more information, see Example Block Device Mapping in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "[DeviceName](#cfn-as-launchconfig-blockdev-mapping-devicename)" : String,
  "[Ebs](#cfn-as-launchconfig-blockdev-mapping-ebs)" : BlockDevice,
  "[NoDevice](#cfn-as-launchconfig-blockdev-mapping-nodevice)" : Boolean,
  "[VirtualName](#cfn-as-launchconfig-blockdev-mapping-virtualname)" : String
}
YAML
[DeviceName](#cfn-as-launchconfig-blockdev-mapping-devicename): String
  [Ebs](#cfn-as-launchconfig-blockdev-mapping-ebs): 
    BlockDevice
  [NoDevice](#cfn-as-launchconfig-blockdev-mapping-nodevice): Boolean
  [VirtualName](#cfn-as-launchconfig-blockdev-mapping-virtualname): String
Properties
DeviceName 
The device name exposed to the EC2 instance (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh). For more information, see Device Naming on Linux Instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Required: Yes
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 255
Pattern: [\u0020-\uD7FF\uE000-\uFFFD\uD800\uDC00-\uDBFF\uDFFF\r\n\t]*
Update requires: No interruption
Ebs 
Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when an instance is launched.
You can specify either VirtualName or Ebs, but not both.
Required: No
Type: BlockDevice
Update requires: No interruption
NoDevice 
Setting this value to true suppresses the specified device included in the block device mapping of the AMI.
If NoDevice is true for the root device, instances might fail the EC2 health check. In that case, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches replacement instances.
If you specify NoDevice, you cannot specify Ebs.
Required: No
Type: Boolean
Update requires: No interruption
VirtualName 
The name of the virtual device. The name must be in the form ephemeralX where X is a number starting from zero (0), for example, ephemeral0.
You can specify either VirtualName or Ebs, but not both. 
Required: No
Type: String
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 255
Pattern: [\u0020-\uD7FF\uE000-\uFFFD\uD800\uDC00-\uDBFF\uDFFF\r\n\t]*
Update requires: No interruption
