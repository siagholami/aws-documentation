AWS::ECS::Cluster CapacityProviderStrategyItem
The CapacityProviderStrategyItem property specifies the details of the default capacity provider strategy for the cluster. When services or tasks are run in the cluster with no launch type or capacity provider strategy specified, the default capacity provider strategy is used.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON
{
  "[Base](#cfn-ecs-cluster-capacityproviderstrategyitem-base)" : Integer,
  "[CapacityProvider](#cfn-ecs-cluster-capacityproviderstrategyitem-capacityprovider)" : String,
  "[Weight](#cfn-ecs-cluster-capacityproviderstrategyitem-weight)" : Integer
}
YAML
[Base](#cfn-ecs-cluster-capacityproviderstrategyitem-base): Integer
  [CapacityProvider](#cfn-ecs-cluster-capacityproviderstrategyitem-capacityprovider): String
  [Weight](#cfn-ecs-cluster-capacityproviderstrategyitem-weight): Integer
Properties
Base 
The base value designates how many tasks, at a minimum, to run on the specified capacity provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base defined.
Required: No
Type: Integer
Minimum: 0
Maximum: 100000
Update requires: No interruption
CapacityProvider 
The short name of the capacity provider.
Required: No
Type: String
Update requires: No interruption
Weight 
The weight value designates the relative percentage of the total number of tasks launched that should use the specified capacity provider.
For example, if you have a strategy that contains two capacity providers and both have a weight of 1, then when the base is satisfied, the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight of 1 for capacityProviderA and a weight of 4 for capacityProviderB, then for every one task that is run using capacityProviderA, four tasks would use capacityProviderB.
