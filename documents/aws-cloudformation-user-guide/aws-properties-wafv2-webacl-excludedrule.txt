AWS::WAFv2::WebACL ExcludedRule
Note
This is the latest version of AWS WAF, named AWS WAFV2, released in November, 2019. For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources from the prior release, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. 
Specifies a single rule to exclude from the rule group. Excluding a rule overrides its action setting for the rule group in the web ACL, setting it to COUNT. This effectively excludes the rule from acting on web requests.
