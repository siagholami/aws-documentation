AWS::Transfer::Server EndpointDetails
The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can make it accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IPs and make it accessible to clients over the internet. You VPC's default security groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.
Note
It is recommended that you use VPC as the EndpointType. With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with EndpointType set to VPC_ENDPOINT.
