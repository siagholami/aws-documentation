Description
The Description section (optional) enables you to include comments about your template.
The value for the description declaration must be a literal string that is between 0 and 1024 bytes in length. You cannot use a parameter or function to specify the description. The following snippet is an example of a description declaration:
JSON
"Description" : "Here are some details about the template."
YAML
Description: >
  Here are some
  details about
  the template.
