Connecting to your Linux or Unix instance in Amazon Lightsail
Last updated: July 5, 2018 
Amazon Lightsail provides you with a browser-based SSH client, which is the fastest way to connect to your Linux or Unix instance. You can also use your own SSH client to connect to your instance. For more information, see Download and set up PuTTY to connect using SSH in Amazon Lightsail.
Connect to your instance with SSH to perform administrative tasks on the server, such as installing software packages or configuring web applications. The browser-based SSH client requires no software installation, and is available almost immediately after you create an instance.
Note
To connect to a Windows Server instance in Lightsail, see Connect to your Windows-based instance using Amazon Lightsail.
