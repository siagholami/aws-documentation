Getting started using WordPress from your Amazon Lightsail instance
Last updated: May 17, 2017 
If you're reading this, it means you successfully created a Lightsail instance that's running WordPress. Congrats! If you still need to create a WordPress instance, go ahead and do that now. We'll wait for you...
Now you're ready to get started with some basic administrative tasks. First, let's log in to your WordPress Dashboard.
Step 1: Go to your WordPress blog and log in
Here's how to log in to your WordPress blog.


Go to the Lightsail home page and find your WordPress blog.


Copy the Public IP address to the clipboard. You can find this address on the Lightsail home page or on the instance details page.


Paste the IP address into your browser.


You should see something like this:



Choose Manage in the lower right corner.


Choose Login to log in to the admin console.


Use the default user name (user).


To get the password, you need to connect to your instance.


Go back to Lightsail and choose Connect using SSH to connect to your WordPress instance.

Type the following:

cat bitnami_application_password
Note
If you're in a directory other than the user home directory, then type cat $HOME/bitnami_application_password.
You should see something like this:



Highlight your password in the terminal screen, then choose the clipboard icon.


Highlight the text you want to copy in the clipboard text box, then press CtrlC or CmdC to copy the text to your local clipboard.

Important
You should save your password somewhere at this time. You can always change it later to something that's easier to remember.


Paste your password into the WordPress login page, and then choose Log In.


If you succeed, you'll see the WordPress Dashboard.

Step 2: Update your profile or password in the WordPress Dashboard
Now that you have access to your WordPress Dashboard, you can create another user or change your password to something that's easier to remember.


Choose Users.


Choose user, and then choose Edit.


Update your Personal Options on the Profile page, and when you're done choose Update Profile.
