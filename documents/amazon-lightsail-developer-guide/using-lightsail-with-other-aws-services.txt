Virtual machines (virtual private servers)
Amazon EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It's designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.
The simple web service interface of Amazon EC2 enables you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazonâ€™s proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, so you can quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by enabling you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers with tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

Amazon VPC
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud, where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon VPC. For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that has access to the Internet, and place your backend systems such as databases or application servers in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access. You can leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet.
Additionally, you can create a Hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your corporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS Cloud as an extension of your corporate datacenter.

Serverless computing
AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code isn't running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.

These include the Classic Load Balancer that routes traffic based on either application or network-level information, and the Application Load Balancer that routes traffic based on advanced application-level information that includes the content of the request. The Classic Load Balancer is ideal for simple load balancing of traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. The Application Load Balancer is ideal for applications needing advanced routing capabilities, microservices, and container-based architectures. Application Load Balancer offers the ability to route traffic to multiple services or to load balance across multiple ports on the same Amazon EC2 instance.
