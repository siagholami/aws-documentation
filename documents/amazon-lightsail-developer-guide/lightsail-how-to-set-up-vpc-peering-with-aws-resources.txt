Set up Amazon VPC peering to work with AWS resources outside of Amazon Lightsail
Last updated: June 13, 2019 
Lightsail lets you connect to AWS resources, such as an Amazon RDS database, through virtual private cloud (VPC) peering. A VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. Everything you create inside Lightsail is inside a VPC, and you can connect your Lightsail VPC to an Amazon VPC.
Some AWS resources, such as Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon DynamoDB don't require VPC peering to be enabled.
Note
To enable VPC peering in Lightsail, you need to have a default Amazon VPC. If you don't have a default Amazon VPC, you can create yours again (or create one for the first time, if you have an older AWS account). To learn more, see Creating a Default VPC  in the Amazon VPC documentation.
Since AWS Regions are isolated from one another, a VPC is also isolated in the region where you created it. You'll need to enable VPC peering in each region where you have Lightsail resources.
Once you have a default Amazon VPC, follow these instructions to peer your Lightsail VPC with your Amazon VPC.


In the Lightsail console, choose Account on the top navigation menu. 


Choose Account from the drop-down.


Choose the Advanced tab.


Choose Enable VPC peering under the AWS Region where you want to enable it.



If the peering connection fails, try to enable VPC peering again. If it doesn't work, contact AWS Customer Support.
To find your Lightsail VPC in the AWS Management Console, go to your Amazon VPC Dashboard.
For more information about Amazon VPC, see Your VPC and Subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
