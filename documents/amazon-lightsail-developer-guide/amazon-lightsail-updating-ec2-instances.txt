Updating Amazon EC2 instances for enhanced networking
Last updated: November 28, 2018 
Some Lightsail instances are incompatible with the current generation EC2 instance types (T3, M5, C5, or R5) because they are not enabled for enhanced networking. If your source Lightsail instance is incompatible, you will need to choose a previous generation instance type (T2, M4, C4, or R4) when creating an EC2 instance from your exported snapshot. These instance type options are presented to you when creating an EC2 instance using the Create an Amazon EC2 instance page in the Lightsail console.
Note
For more information about enhanced networking, see Enhanced Networking on Linux or Enhanced Networking on Windows in the Amazon EC2 documentation.
To use the latest generation EC2 instance types when the source Lightsail instance is incompatible, you need to create the new EC2 instance using a previous generation instance type (T2, M4, C4, or R4), update the networking driver on your instance, and then upgrade the instance to the desired current generation instance type.
Prerequisites
You must create an Amazon EC2 instance from an exported Lightsail snapshot. If your Lightsail instance is incompatible, you’ll choose a previous generation instance type (T2, M4, C4, or R4) when creating the Amazon EC2 instance. To learn more, see Creating Amazon EC2 instances from exported snapshots in Lightsail.
After your new EC2 instance is up and running, continue to the Enable Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter section of this guide to learn how to enable enhanced networking.
Enable Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter
After your new instance is up and running, see one of the following guides in the Amazon EC2 documentation to enable enhanced networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA):
 Enabling Enhanced Networking with the ENA on Linux Instances
 Enabling Enhanced Networking with the ENA on Windows Instances
Upgrade your instance type
After you have enabled enhanced networking, you can upgrade the instance type by following the instructions in one of the following guides:
