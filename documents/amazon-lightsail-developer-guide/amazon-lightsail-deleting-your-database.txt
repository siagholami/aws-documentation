Deleting your database in Amazon Lightsail
Last updated: March 15, 2019 
Delete your managed database in Amazon Lightsail if you no longer need it. You stop incurring charges for the database as soon as it’s deleted.
Note
You can’t recover a deleted database. You can create a final snapshot of your database as part of the steps covered in this guide, or you can create a snapshot separately from the deletion process. For more information, see Creating a snapshot of your database in Amazon Lightsail.
To delete your database


Sign in to the Lightsail console.


On the Lightsail home page, choose the Databases tab.


Choose the name of the database that you want to delete.


Choose the Delete tab.


Add a checkmark next to Create snapshot before deletion to create a final snapshot before deleting the database. Then enter a name for your snapshot.


Resource names:
    Must be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account.
    Must contain 2 to 255 characters.
    Must start and end with an alphanumeric character or number.
    Can include alphanumeric characters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores.


Choose Delete database.


Choose Yes, delete to confirm the deletion.



If you opted to create a snapshot before deleting, you can view it on the Snapshots tab of the Lightsail home page.
