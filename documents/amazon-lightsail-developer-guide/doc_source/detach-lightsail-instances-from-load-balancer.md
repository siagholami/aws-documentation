 *Last updated: November 29, 2017* 

If you no longer want to have an instance attached to your Lightsail load balancer, you can detach it\. When you detach a Lightsail instance from a load balancer, we wait until the specified instances are no longer needed before detaching\.

1. On the Lightsail home page, choose **Networking**\.

1. Choose the load balancer you want to manage\.

1. On the **Target instances** tab, choose **Detach** next to the load balancer you want to detach\.
