# Networking resources in Lightsail<a name="understanding-networking-resources-in-lightsail"></a>

**Note**  
Lightsail has several networking resources to choose from: DNS zones, load balancers, and static IP addresses\. These resources improve how users and outside services connect to your Lightsail instances\. DNS helps make your web application easier to find, static IP addresses let you keep the same IP address every time you reboot your instance, and load balancers add redundancy and help you handle more web traffic\.
