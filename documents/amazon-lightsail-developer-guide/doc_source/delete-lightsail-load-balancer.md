# Delete a Lightsail load balancer<a name="delete-lightsail-load-balancer"></a>

 *Last updated: November 29, 2017* 

You can delete a Lightsail load balancer if you no longer need it\. Deleting a load balancer also detaches any Lightsail instances attached to it but doesn't delete the Lightsail instances\. If you enabled encrypted \(HTTPS\) traffic using an SSL/TLS certificate, deleting the load balancer will also permanently delete any SSL/TLS certificates associated with the load balancer\.

**Important**  
Deleting a Lightsail load balancer and its associated certificate is final and can't be undone\.
