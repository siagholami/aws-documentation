I can't create a certificate.
There is a quota to the number of certificates you can create in an AWS account. For more information, see Quotas in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide. The same quota apply to Lightsail certificates for load balancers.
Actual error message:  Sorry, you've requested too many certificates for your account.
I can't attach any more instances to my load balancer.
You can attach as many Lightsail instances as you like to your load balancer, as long as you stay within the quota of 20 total Lightsail instances per AWS account.
Actual error message:  Sorry, you've reached the maximum number of instances you can attach to this load balancer.
I can't attach a specific instance to my load balancer.
First, check to make sure your Lightsail instance is running. If it is stopped, you can start it from the instance management page. Lightsail instances must be running to be successfully attached to a load balancer.
It could be that you have attached the same instance to too many load balancers.
Actual error message:  Sorry, you've reached the maximum number of times an instance can be registered with a load balancer.
