 Troubleshoot common issues with browser-based logs and metrics.
 Recover data by using point-in-time backup and restore operations.
The efficient Lightsail experience enables you to build your application on a Lightsail instance and connect it to a Lightsail managed database. You can also create a standalone database, and connect analytics or querying tools for your company.
