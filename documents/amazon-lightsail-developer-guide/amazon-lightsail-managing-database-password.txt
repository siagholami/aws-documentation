Managing your database password in Amazon Lightsail
Last updated: March 15, 2019 
When you create a new database in Amazon Lightsail, you can let Lightsail create a strong password for you or specify your own. You can view or change the current database password at any time in the Lightsail console.
To manage your database password


Sign in to the Lightsail console.


On the Lightsail home page, choose the Databases tab.


Choose the name of the database for which you want to manage the password.


On the Connect tab, under the User name and passwords section, choose Show to view the current database password.



To change the database password, choose Change password.


You can opt to have Lightsail create a strong password for you, or you can enter your own password into the text box. Your password must be at least eight characters in length. You can use any character except the "at" sign ( @ ), forward slash ( / ), quotation mark ( " ), or space.


Choose Save when youâ€™re done.

A database password change is applied immediately. If you entered your own password, the password is saved immediately. If Lightsail created the password for you, it is generated within a few seconds. Choose Show to view the new password.
