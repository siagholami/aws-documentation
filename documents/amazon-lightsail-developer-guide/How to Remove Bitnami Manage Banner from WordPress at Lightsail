After installing WordPress at Amazon’s Lightsail and accessing the website online, you might have noticed the Bitnami manage banner at the bottom-right of the page. It sort of peels off at the end of all the web pages and is publicly displayed. Hovering over it, allows crossing it off and removing it from the screen, temporarily.


Clicking on it will take us to the index page of Bitnami containing important links to the documentation. You might want to bookmark this link before removing the link altogether.

To remove the “Bitnami Manage” banner from WordPress installations at Amazon’s Lightsail, follow these steps:

Access your Amazon Lightsail’s dashboard.
Click on your WordPress installation instance.
Click on Connect using SSH
Enter the command
sudo /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/bnconfig --disable_banner 1
Reboot your instance from the dashboard or using the following command
Apache Server (usually the case):
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart apache
NGINX
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart nginx
