Copying snapshots from one AWS Region to another in Amazon Lightsail
Last updated: November 28, 2018 
Amazon Lightsail lets you copy instance snapshots and block storage disk snapshots from one AWS Region to another, or within the same Region. Copy snapshots between Regions if you created and configured resources in one Region, but later decide that a different Region is more appropriate. Or, if you want to replicate your resources across multiple Regions. This guide describes the process of copying Lightsail snapshots.
Prerequisites
Create a snapshot of the Lightsail instance or block storage disk that you want to copy. For more information, see one of the following guides:
 Creating a snapshot of your Linux or Unix instance in Amazon Lightsail
 Creating a snapshot of your Windows Server instance in Amazon Lightsail
 Creating a snapshot of your block storage disk in Amazon Lightsail

You can copy instance snapshots and block storage disk snapshots from one AWS Region to another, or within the same Region.
To copy a Lightsail snapshot


Sign in to the Lightsail console.


From the Lightsail home page, choose the Snapshots tab.


Locate the instance or block storage disk that you want to copy, and expand the node to view the available snapshots for that resource.


Choose the actions menu icon (⋮) for the desired snapshot, then choose Copy to another Region.



On the Copy a snapshot page, in the Snapshot to copy section, confirm that the snapshot details displayed match the specifications of the source instance or block storage disk.



In the Select a Region section of the page, choose the Region for your snapshot copy.


Enter a name for your snapshot copy.


Resource names:
    Must be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account.
    Must contain 2 to 255 characters.
    Must start and end with an alphanumeric character or number.
    Can include alphanumeric characters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores.

Choose Copy snapshot.


Your snapshot copy should be available soon. It depends on the size and configuration of the source instance. You can check the status of your snapshot copy by browsing to the Snapshots tab on the Lightsail home page, and looking for the snapshot with a status of Creating as shown in the following screenshot. The status will change when the snapshot is ready.

Next steps
Here are a few additional steps you can perform after copying a snapshot to another Region in Lightsail:
 Create a new instance from the copied snapshot after it’s available. For more information, see Creating an instance from a snapshot in Amazon Lightsail.
 Delete the source snapshot if you no longer need it. Otherwise, you will be billed for storing the snapshot.
