Detach one or more instances from a Lightsail load balancer
Last updated: November 29, 2017 
If you no longer want to have an instance attached to your Lightsail load balancer, you can detach it. When you detach a Lightsail instance from a load balancer, we wait until the specified instances are no longer needed before detaching.


On the Lightsail home page, choose Networking.


Choose the load balancer you want to manage.


On the Target instances tab, choose Detach next to the load balancer you want to detach.
