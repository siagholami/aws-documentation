Creating a database from a point-in-time backup in Amazon Lightsail
Last updated: March 15, 2019 
You can create a new managed database by using a point-in-time backup in Amazon Lightsail. Point-in-time backups of your database are available in 5-minute increments, and for the previous seven days. This gives you the ability to restore a failed database to a specific date and time in the last week.
You can also create a new database from a snapshot. For more information, see Creating a database from a snapshot in Amazon Lightsail.
To create a database from a point-in-time backup


Sign in to the Lightsail console.


On the Lightsail home page, choose the Databases tab.


Choose the name of the database for which you want to change plans.


Choose the Snapshots and restore tab.


Under the Emergency restore section, select the date and time of the backup that you want to use for your new database.



Choose Restore to new database.


On the Create a new database page, choose Change zone to select a different Availability Zone. Your new database is then created in the same AWS Region as the snapshot that you selected earlier.


Choose your new database plan.


Pick a high availability or a standard database plan. A database created with a high availability plan has a primary database and a secondary standby database in another Availability Zone for failover support. For more information, see High availability databases in Amazon Lightsail.
Note
You cannot choose a database plan that is smaller than the plan of the original database.

Enter a name for your database.

Resource names:
    Must be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account.
    Must contain 2 to 255 characters.
    Must start and end with an alphanumeric character or number.
    Can include alphanumeric characters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores.


Choose one of the following options to add tags to your database:
    Add key-only tags or Edit key-only tags (if tags have already been added). Enter your new tag into the tag key text box, and press Enter. Choose Save when you’re done entering your tags to add them, or choose Cancel to not add them.

    Create a key-value tag, then enter a key into the Key text box, and a value into the Value text box. Choose Save when you’re done entering your tags, or choose Cancel to not add them.
Key-value tags can only be added one at a time before saving. To add more than one key-value tag, repeat the previous steps.

Note
For more information about key-only and key-value tags, see Tags in Amazon Lightsail.


Choose Create database.


Within minutes, your new Lightsail database is ready with the new database plan or bundle.
Next steps
Complete the following actions after your new database is up and running:
 Delete the original database if you no longer need it. For more information, see Deleting your database in Amazon Lightsail.
 Databases created from a point-in-time backup are configured to use a strong password created by Lightsail. For more information, see Managing your database password in Amazon Lightsail.
