Do you need failover support for your Amazon Lightsail database? A Lightsail high availability managed database provides this support with a primary database in one Availability Zone, and a secondary standby database in another. We recommend high availability databases for production workloads that experience heavy use and require data redundancy. For development and test purposes, you can use a standard database that isn't high availability.
To create a high availability database, select one of the high availability database plans available in Lightsail when creating your managed database. For more information, see Creating a database in Amazon Lightsail . You can also change your standard database to a high availability database. Create a snapshot of your standard database, create a new database from the snapshot, and choose a high availability plan. For more information, see Creating a database from a snapshot in Amazon Lightsail.
