Deleting automatic snapshots of instances or disks in Amazon Lightsail
Last updated: October 2, 2019 
You can delete automatic snapshots of an instance or block storage disk in Amazon Lightsail at any time; whether the feature is enabled, or if it's disabled after it had been enabled. You will be billed the snapshot storage fee for the automatic snapshots stored on your Lightsail account. Follow the steps in this guide to delete automatic snapshots if you no longer need them. For example, if you've copied an automatic snapshot to a manual snapshot and you no longer need the original, or if you've disabled the automatic snapshots feature for your resource and you don't need the existing automatic snapshots that were kept.
