Manually install SSM Agent on EC2 instances for Linux
Before you manually install SSM Agent on an Amazon EC2 Linux operating system, review the following important details.
 SSM Agent is installed by default on the following EC2 instances and Amazon Machine Images:
   Amazon Linux
   Amazon Linux 2
   Ubuntu Server 16.04
   Ubuntu Server 18.04
   Amazon ECS-Optimized
 The manual procedures enable you to install SSM Agent from any AWS Region. If you want to download the agent from a specific Region, see "Download SSM Agent from a specific AWS Region" later in this topic. That section describes how to change the URL that you specify in the manual procedure. That section does not describe how to download and install the agent. You must choose one of the operating system links and then substitute the URL to download from a specific Region.
 If you need to install the agent on an on-premises server or a virtual machine (VM) so it can be used with Systems Manager, see Install SSM Agent for a hybrid environment (Linux).
 An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities. If an older version of the agent is running on an instance, some SSM Agent processes can fail. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up-to-date on your instances. For information, see Automating updates to SSM Agent. To be notified about SSM Agent updates, subscribe to the SSM Agent Release Notes page on GitHub.
