Running PowerShell scripts on Linux instances
Using the aws:runPowerShellScript plugin or the AWS-RunPowerShellScript command document, along with PowerShell Core, you can run PowerShell scripts on Linux instances. This can be useful for systems administrators who are familiar with PowerShell and prefer it to other scripting languages.
Before You Begin
Connect to your Linux instance and follow the PowerShell Core  installation procedure for the appropriate operating system.
Note
Many PowerShell commands (cmdlets) are not available on Linux. To see which commands are available, use the Get-Command cmdlet after starting PowerShell using the pwsh command on your Linux instance. For more information, see Get-Command. 
The following procedure describes how to run a PowerShell script on a Linux instance using the console.
To run a PowerShell script on a Linux instance using the console


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Run Command.


-or-
If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon () to open the navigation pane, and then choose Run Command.


Choose Run command.


In the Command document list, choose the AWS-RunPowerShellScript document.


In the Command parameters section, specify the available PowerShell commands you want to use.


In the Targets section, identify the instances on which you want to run this operation by specifying tags, selecting instances manually, or specifying a resource group.
Note
If you choose to select instances manually, and an instance you expect to see is not included in the list, see Some of my instances are missing for troubleshooting tips.


For Other parameters:
    For Comment, type information about this command.
    For Timeout (seconds), specify the number of seconds for the system to wait before failing the overall command execution. 


(Optional) For Rate control:
    For Concurrency, specify either a number or a percentage of instances on which to run the command at the same time.
Note
If you selected targets by specifying tags applied to managed instances or by specifying AWS resource groups, and you are not certain how many instances are targeted, then restrict the number of instances that can run the document at the same time by specifying a percentage.
    For Error threshold, specify when to stop running the command on other instances after it fails on either a number or a percentage of instances. For example, if you specify three errors, then Systems Manager stops sending the command when the fourth error is received. Instances still processing the command might also send errors.


(Optional) For Output options, to save the command output to a file, select the Write command output to an S3 bucket box. Type the bucket and prefix (folder) names in the boxes.
Note
The S3 permissions that grant the ability to write the data to an S3 bucket are those of the instance profile assigned to the instance, not those of the IAM user performing this task. For more information, see Create an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager. In addition, if the specified S3 bucket is in a different AWS account, ensure that the instance profile associated with the instance has the necessary permissions to write to that bucket.


In the SNS notifications section, if you want notifications sent about the status of the command execution, select the Enable SNS notifications check box.


For more information about configuring Amazon SNS notifications for Run Command, see Monitoring Systems Manager status changes using Amazon SNS notifications.

Choose Run.
