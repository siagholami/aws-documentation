AWSSupport-SetupIPMonitoringFromVPC
Description
AWSSupport-SetupIPMonitoringFromVPC creates an EC2 instance in the specified subnet and monitors selected target IPs (IPv4 or IPv6) by continuously running ping, MTR, traceroute and tracetcp tests. The results are stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs logs, and metric filters are applied to quickly visualize latency and packet loss statistics in a CloudWatch dashboard.
Additional Information
The CloudWatch Logs data can be used for network troubleshooting and analysis of pattern/trends. Additionally, you can configure CloudWatch alarms with Amazon SNS notifications when packet loss and/or latency reach a threshold. The data can also be used when opening a Premium Support case, to help isolate an issue quickly and reduce time to resolution when investigating a network issue.
Note
To clean up resources created by AWSSupport-SetupIPMonitoringFromVPC, you can run the Automation document AWSSupport-TerminateIPMonitoringFromVPC. For more information, see AWSSupport-TerminateIPMonitoringFromVPC.

Parameters
 AutomationAssumeRole
Type: String
Description: (Optional) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows Systems Manager Automation to perform the actions on your behalf. If no role is specified, Systems Manager Automation uses the permissions of the user that runs this document.

Default: /AWSSupport-SetupIPMonitoringFromVPC
Description: (Optional) Prefix used for each CloudWatch log group created for the test results.
 CloudWatchLogGroupRetentionInDays

Default: t2.micro
Description: (Optional) The EC2 instance type for the EC2Rescue instance. Recommended size: t2.micro.
 SubnetId
Type: String
Description: (Required) The subnet ID for the monitor instance. Be aware that if you specify a private subnet, then you must make sure there is Internet access to allow the monitor instance to setup the test (meaning, install the CloudWatch Logs agent, interact with Systems Manager and CloudWatch).
 TargetIPs
Type: String
Description: (Required) Comma separated list of IPv4s and/or IPv6s to monitor. No spaces allowed. Maximum size is 255 characters. Be aware that if you provide an invalid IP, then the automation will fail and rollback the test setup.
Required IAM Permissions
The AutomationAssumeRole requires the following actions to successfully run the Automation document.
It is recommended that the user who runs the automation have the AmazonSSMAutomationRole IAM managed policy attached. In addition, the user must have the following policy attached to their user account, group, or role:
