Manually install SSM Agent on Amazon Linux 2 instances
Connect to your Amazon Linux 2 instance and perform the following steps to install SSM Agent. 
Note
If you use a yum command to update SSM Agent on a managed instance after the agent has been installed or updated using the SSM document AWS-UpdateSSMAgent, you might see the following message: "Warning: RPMDB altered outside of yum." This message is expected and can be safely ignored.
Perform these steps on each instance that will run commands using Systems Manager.
Important
SSM Agent is installed, by default, on Amazon Linux base AMIs dated 2017.09 and later. SSM Agent is also installed, by default, on Amazon Linux 2 AMIs. You must manually install SSM Agent on other versions of Linux.

After installing the agent, run the following command to determine if the SSM Agent is running. The command should return the message amazon-ssm-agent is running.

sudo systemctl enable amazon-ssm-agent
sudo systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent
sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent
Important
An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities. If an older version of the agent is running on an instance, some SSM Agent processes can fail. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up-to-date on your instances. For information, see Automating updates to SSM Agent. To be notified about SSM Agent updates, subscribe to the SSM Agent Release Notes page on GitHub.
