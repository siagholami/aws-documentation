Tagging managed instances
The topics in this section describe how to work with tags on managed instances.
A managed instance is any machine configured for AWS Systems Manager. This includes EC2 instances, as well as on-premises servers or virtual machines (VMs) that you have configured to manage using Systems Manager in a hybrid environment.
The instructions in this topic are applicable to any machine that is being managed using Systems Manager.

Creating or activating managed instances with tags
You can add tags to EC2 instances at the time you create them. You can add tags to on-premises servers and virtual machines (VMs) at the time you activate them.
For information, see the following topics:
 For EC2 instances, see Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. (Content applies to both EC2 instances for Linux and for Windows)
 For on-premises servers and VMs, see Create a managed-instance activation for a hybrid environment.
Adding tags to existing managed instances
You can add tags to managed instances by using the Systems Manager console or the command line.

Adding tags to an existing managed instance (command line)
To add tags to an existing managed instance (command line)

Using your preferred command line tool, run the following command to view the list of managed instances that you can tag.


[ Linux ]
aws ssm describe-instance-information

[ Windows ]
aws ssm describe-instance-information

[ PowerShell ]
Get-SSMInstanceInformation

Note the ID of a managed instance that you want to tag.
Note
Machines that have been registered for use with Systems Manager in a hybrid environment begin with mi-, such as mi-0471e04240EXAMPLE;. EC2 instances have IDs that begin with i-, such as i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE.

Run the following command to tag a managed instance.


[ Linux ]
aws ssm add-tags-to-resource \
       --resource-type "ManagedInstance" \
       --resource-id "instance-id" \
       --tags "Key=tag-key,Value=tag-value"

[ Windows ]
aws ssm add-tags-to-resource ^
       --resource-type "ManagedInstance" ^
       --resource-id "instance-id" ^
       --tags "Key=tag-key,Value=tag-value"

[ PowerShell ]
$tag = New-Object Amazon.SimpleSystemsManagement.Model.Tag
$tag.Key = "tag-key"
$tag.Value = "tag-value"
Add-SSMResourceTag `
       -ResourceType "ManagedInstance" `
       -ResourceId "instance-id" `
       -Tag $tag `
       -Force

tag-key is the name of a custom key you supply. For example, Region or Quarter.
tag-value is the custom content for the value you want to supply for that key. For example, West or Q321.
instance-id is the ID of the managed instance you want to tag.
If successful, the command has no output.

Run the following command to verify the managed instance tags.


[ Linux ]
aws ssm list-tags-for-resource \
       --resource-type "ManagedInstance" \
       --resource-id "instance-id"

[ Windows ]
aws ssm list-tags-for-resource ^
       --resource-type "ManagedInstance" ^
       --resource-id "instance-id"

[ PowerShell ]
Get-SSMResourceTag `
       -ResourceType "ManagedInstance" `
       -ResourceId "instance-id"

Note the name of a managed instance from which you want to remove tags.

Run the following command to remove tags from a managed instance.


[ Linux ]
aws ssm remove-tags-from-resource \
       --resource-type "ManagedInstance" \

       --tag-key "tag-key"

[ Windows ]
aws ssm remove-tags-from-resource ^
       --resource-type "ManagedInstance" ^
       --resource-id "instance-id" ^
       --tag-key "tag-key"

[ PowerShell ]
Remove-SSMResourceTag `
       -ResourceId "instance-id" `
       -ResourceType "ManagedInstance" `
