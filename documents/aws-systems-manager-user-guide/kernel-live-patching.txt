Use Kernel Live Patching on Amazon Linux 2 instances
Kernel Live Patching for Amazon Linux 2 enables you to apply security vulnerability and critical bug patches to a running Linux kernel, without reboots or disruptions to running applications. This allows you to benefit from improved service and application availability, while keeping your infrastructure secure and up to date. Kernel Live Patching is supported on Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines running Amazon Linux 2.
For general information about Kernel Live Patching, see Kernel Live Patching on Amazon Linux 2 in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
After you enable Kernel Live Patching on an Amazon Linux 2 instance, you can use Patch Manager to apply kernel live patches to the instance. Using Patch Manager is an alternative to using existing yum workflows on the instance to apply the updates.
Before you begin
To use Patch Manager to apply kernel live patches to your Amazon Linux 2 instances, ensure your instances are based on the correct architecture and kernel version. For information, see Supported configurations and prerequisites in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

About Kernel Live Patching and Patch Manager
Updating the kernel version
You do not need to reboot an instance after applying a kernel live patch update. However, AWS provides kernel live patches for an Amazon Linux 2 kernel version for up to three months after its release. After the three-month period, you must update to a later kernel version to continue to receive kernel live patches. We recommend using a maintenance window to schedule a reboot of your instance at least once every three months to prompt the kernel version update.
Uninstalling kernel live patches
Kernel live patches can't be uninstalled using Patch Manager. Instead, you can disable Kernel Live Patching, which removes the RPM packages for the applied kernel live patches. For more information, see Disabling Kernel Live Patching using Run Command.
Kernel compliance
In some cases, installing all CVE fixes from live patches for the current kernel version can bring that kernel into the same compliance state that a newer kernel version would have. When that happens, the newer version is reported as Installed, and the instance reported as Compliant. No installation time is reported for newer kernel version, however.
One kernel live patch, multiple CVEs
If a kernel live patch addresses multiple CVEs, and those CVEs have various classification and severity values, only the highest classification and severity from among the CVEs is reported for the patch. 
The remainder of this section describes how to use Patch Manager to apply kernel live patches to instances that meet these requirements.
How it works
AWS releases two types of kernel live patches for Amazon Linux 2: security updates and bug fixes. To apply those types of patches, you use a patch baseline document that targets only the classifications and severities listed in the following table.



Classification
Severity




Security
Critical, Important


Bugfix
All



You can create a custom patch baseline that targets only these patches, or use the predefined AWS-AmazonLinux2DefaultPatchBaseline patch baseline. In other words, you can use AWS-AmazonLinux2DefaultPatchBaseline with Amazon Linux 2 instances on which Kernel Live Patching is enabled, and kernel live updates will be applied.
Note
The AWS-AmazonLinux2DefaultPatchBaseline configuration specifies a seven-day waiting period after a patch is released before it is installed automatically. If you don't want to wait seven days for kernel live patches to be auto-approved, you can create and use a custom patch baseline. In your patch baseline, you can specify no auto-approval waiting period, or specify a shorter or longer one. For more information, see Working with custom patch baselines.
We recommend the following strategy to patch your instances with kernel live updates:


Enable Kernel Live Patching on your Amazon Linux 2 instances.


Use Run Command to run a Scan operation on your instances using the predefined AWS-AmazonLinux2DefaultPatchBaseline or a custom patch baseline that also targets only Security updates with severity classified as Critical and Important, and the Bugfix severity of All. 


Open Systems Manager Compliance at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/compliance and review whether non-compliance for patching is reported for any of the instances that were scanned. If so, view the instance compliance details to determine whether any kernel live patches are missing from the instance.


To install missing kernel live patches, use Run Command with the same patch baseline you specified before, but this time run an Install operation instead of a Scan operation.


Because kernel live patches are installed without the need to reboot, you can choose the NoReboot reboot option for this operation. 
Note
You can still reboot the instance if required for other types of patches installed on the instance, or if you want to update to a newer kernel. In these cases, choose the RebootIfNeeded reboot option instead.

Return to Systems Manager Compliance to verify that the kernel live patches were installed.

Enabling Kernel Live Patching using Run Command
To enable Kernel Live Patching, you can either run yum commands on your instances or use Run Command and a custom Systems Manager document that you create.
For information about enabling Kernel Live Patching by running yum commands directly on the instance, see Enabling Kernel Live Patching in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
Note
When you enable Kernel Live Patching, if the kernel already running on the instance is earlier than kernel-4.14.165-131.185.amzn2.x86_64 (the minimum supported version), the process installs the latest available kernel version and reboots the instance. If the instance is already running kernel-4.14.165-131.185.amzn2.x86_64 or later, the process doesn't install a newer version and doesn't reboot the instance.
To enable Kernel Live Patching using Run Command (console)


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Run Command.


-or-
If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon () to open the navigation pane, and then choose Run Command.


Choose Run command.


In the Command document list, choose the custom Systems Manager document AWS-ConfigureKernelLivePatching.


In the Command parameters section, specify whether you want instances to reboot as part of this operation.
