Creating Systems Manager documents
If the Systems Manager public documents don't perform all the actions you want to perform on your AWS resources, you can create your own SSM documents. When you create a new Command or Policy document, we recommend that you use schema version 2.2 or later so you can take advantage of the latest features, such as document editing, automatic versioning, sequencing, and more.
Writing SSM document content
To create your own SSM document content, it's important to understand the different schemas, features, plugins, and syntax available for SSM documents. We recommend becoming familiar with the following resources.

  Creating Automation documents that run scripts 
AWS pre-defined SSM documents might perform some of the actions you require. You can call these documents by using the aws:runDocument, aws:runCommand, or aws:executeAutomation plugins within your custom SSM document, depending on the document type. You can also copy portions of those documents into a custom SSM document, and edit the content to meet your requirements.
Tip
When creating SSM document content, you might change the content and update your SSM document several times while testing. The following commands update the SSM document with your latest content, and update the document's default version to the latest version of the document.
The Linux and Windows commands use the jq command line tool to filter the JSON response data.
```
latestDocVersion=$(aws ssm update-document \
    --content file://path/to/file/documentContent.json \
    --name "ExampleDocument" \
    --document-format JSON \
    --document-version '$LATEST' \
    | jq -r '.DocumentDescription.LatestVersion')
aws ssm update-document-default-version \
    --name "ExampleDocument" \
    --document-version $latestDocVersion
```
```
latestDocVersion=$(aws ssm update-document ^
    --content file://C:\path\to\file\documentContent.json ^
    --name "ExampleDocument" ^
    --document-format JSON ^
    --document-version "$LATEST" ^
    | jq -r '.DocumentDescription.LatestVersion')
aws ssm update-document-default-version ^
    --name "ExampleDocument" ^
    --document-version $latestDocVersion
```
``
$content = Get-Content -Path "C:\path\to\file\documentContent.json" | Out-String
$latestDocVersion = Update-SSMDocument
    -Content $content -Name "ExampleDocument"
    -DocumentFormat "JSON" -DocumentVersion '$LATEST'
    | Select-Object -ExpandProperty LatestVersion
Update-SSMDocumentDefaultVersion -Name "ExampleDocument"
    -DocumentVersion $latestDocVersion
```
Using SSM documents in State Manager Associations
If you create an SSM document for State Manager, you must associate the document with your managed instances after you add the document to the system. For more information, see Create an association.
Keep in mind the following details when using SSM documents in State Manager associations.
 You can assign multiple documents to a target by creating different State Manager associations that use different documents. 
 If you create a document with conflicting plugins (e.g., domain join and remove from domain), the last plugin run will be the final state. State Manager does not validate the logical sequence or rationality of the commands or plugins in your document.
 When processing documents, instance associations are applied first, and next tagged group associations are applied. If an instance is part of multiple tagged groups, then the documents that are part of the tagged group will not be run in any particular order. If an instance is directly targeted through multiple documents by its instance ID, there is no particular order of execution. 
 If you change the default version of an SSM Policy document for State Manager, any association that uses the document will start using the new default version the next time Systems Manager applies the association to the instance.
 If you create an association using an SSM document that was shared with you, and then the owner stops sharing the document with you, your associations no longer have access to that document. However, if the owner shares the same SSM document with you again later, your associations automatically remap to it.
After writing your SSM document content, you can use your content to create an SSM document using one of the following methods.
