Manually install SSM Agent on CentOS instances
Connect to your CentOS instance and perform the following steps to install the SSM Agent. 
Note
If you use a yum command to update SSM Agent on a managed instance after the agent has been installed or updated using the SSM document AWS-UpdateSSMAgent, you might see the following message: "Warning: RPMDB altered outside of yum." This message is expected and can be safely ignored.
Perform these steps on each instance that will run commands using Systems Manager.

Important
An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities. If an older version of the agent is running on an instance, some SSM Agent processes can fail. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up-to-date on your instances. For information, see Automating updates to SSM Agent. To be notified about SSM Agent updates, subscribe to the SSM Agent Release Notes page on GitHub.
