Description 
This document will use the EC2Rescue tool to troubleshoot and where possible repair common connectivity issues with the specified EC2 instance for Linux or Windows Server.
Run this Automation (console)
Document Type
Automation
Owner
Amazon
Platforms
Windows, Linux
Parameters
 AutomationAssumeRole
Type: String
Description: (Optional) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows Systems Manager Automation to perform the actions on your behalf. If no role is specified, Systems Manager Automation uses the permissions of the user that runs this document.
 EC2RescueInstanceType
Type: String
Valid values: t2.small | t2.medium | t2.large
Default: t2.small
Description: (Required) The EC2 instance type for the EC2Rescue instance. Recommended size: t2.small.
 LogDestination
Type: String
Description: (Optional) S3 bucket name in your account where you want to upload the troubleshooting logs. Make sure the bucket policy does not grant unnecessary read/write permissions to parties that do not need access to the collected logs.
 SubnetId
Type: String
Default: CreateNewVPC
Description: (Optional) The subnet ID for the EC2Rescue instance. By default, AWS Systems Manager Automation creates a new VPC. Alternatively, Use SelectedInstanceSubnet to use the same subnet as your instance, or specify a custom subnet ID. IMPORTANT: The subnet must be in the same Availability Zone as UnreachableInstanceId, and it must allow access to the SSM endpoints.
 UnreachableInstanceId
Type: String
Description: (Required) ID of your unreachable EC2 instance. IMPORTANT: AWS Systems Manager Automation stops this instance, and creates an AMI before attempting any operations. Data stored in instance store volumes will be lost. The public IP address will change if you are not using an Elastic IP.
Required IAM Permissions
The AutomationAssumeRole requires the following actions to successfully run the Automation document.
You must have at least ssm:ExecuteAutomation and ssm:GetAutomationExecution to be able to read the automation output. For more information about the required permissions see AWSSupport-StartEC2RescueWorkflow
Document Steps 


aws:assertAwsResourceProperty - Assert if the provided instance is Windows 


(EC2Rescue for Windows) If the provided instance is a Windows Server instance: 


aws:executeAutomation - Invoke AWSSupport-StartEC2RescueWorkflow with the EC2Rescue for Windows offline script


aws:executeAwsApi - Retrieve the backup AMI ID from the nested automation


aws:executeAwsApi - Retrieve the EC2Rescue summary from the nested automation




(EC2Rescue for Linux) If the provided instance is a Linux instance: 


aws:executeAutomation - Invoke AWSSupport-StartEC2RescueWorkflow with the EC2Rescue for Linux offline script


aws:executeAwsApi - Retrieve the backup AMI ID from the nested automation


aws:executeAwsApi - Retrieve the EC2Rescue summary from the nested automation
