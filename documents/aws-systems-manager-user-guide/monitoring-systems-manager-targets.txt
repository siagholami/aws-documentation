Systems Manager target type examples
When you specify the target to invoke in an Amazon EventBridge rule, you can choose from over 20 target types and add up to five targets to each rule.
Of the various targets, you can choose from three AWS Systems Manager capabilities as target actions when an EventBridge event occurs. These capabilities include Automation, OpsCenter, and Run Command.
The following are just a few examples of ways you can use these capabilities as the target of an EventBridge rule.
Automation examples
You can configure an EventBridge rule to start Automation workflows when events such as the following occur:
 When an Amazon CloudWatch alarm reports that a managed instance has failed a status check (StatusCheckFailed_Instance=1), run the AWSSupport-ExecuteEC2Rescue Automation document on the instance.
 When an EC2 Instance State-change Notification event occurs because a new Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance is running, run the AWS-AttachEBSVolume Automation document on the instance.
 When an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume is created and available, run the AWS-CreateSnapshot Automation document on the volume.
OpsCenter examples
You can configure an EventBridge rule to create a new OpsItem when incidents such as the following occur:
 A throttling event for Amazon DynamoDB occurs, or Amazon EBS volume performance has degraded.
 An Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group fails to launch an instance, or a Systems Manager Automation workflow fails.
 An EC2 instance changes state from Running to Stopped.
Run Command examples
You can configure an EventBridge rule to run a Systems Manager Command document in Run Command when events such as the following occur:
 When an Auto Scaling group is about to terminate, a Run Command script could capture the log files from the instance before it is terminated.
 When a new instance is created in an Auto Scaling group, a Run Command target action could enable the web server role or install software on the instance.
 When a managed instance is found to be out of compliance, a Run Command target action could update patches on the instance by running the AWS-RunPatchBaseline document.
