# Document history<a name="systems-manager-release-history"></a>

The following table describes the important changes to the documentation since the last release of AWS Systems Manager\. For notification about updates to this documentation, you can subscribe to an RSS feed\.

**Important**  
An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities\. If an older version of the agent is running on an instance, some SSM Agent processes can fail\. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up\-to\-date on your instances\. For information, see [Automating updates to SSM Agent](ssm-agent-automatic-updates.md)\. To be notified about SSM Agent updates, subscribe to the [SSM Agent Release Notes](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent/blob/master/RELEASENOTES.md) page on GitHub\.

| New chapter | A new chapter, [Identity and access management for AWS Systems Manager](security-iam.md), provides comprehensive information about using [AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) and AWS Systems Manager to help secure access to your resources through the use of credentials\. These credentials provide the permissions required to access AWS resources, such as accessing data stored in S3 buckets and sending commands to and reading the tags on EC2 instances\. | December 11, 2017 | 
|  Changes to the left navigation  |  We changed the headings in the left navigation of this user guide to match the headings in the new [AWS Systems Manager console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.   |  December 8, 2017  | 
|  Multiple changes for re:Invent 2017  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-release-history.html)  |  November 29, 2017  | 
|  Using Run Command to Take VSS\-Enabled Snapshots of EBS Volumes  |  Using Run Command, you can take application\-consistent snapshots of all [Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/EBSVolumes.html) volumes attached to your Amazon EC2 Windows instances\. The snapshot process uses the Windows [Volume Shadow Copy Service \(VSS\)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee923636(v=ws.10).aspx) to take image\-level backups of VSS\-aware applications, including data from pending transactions between these applications and the disk\. Furthermore, you don't need to shut down your instances or disconnect them when you need to back up all attached volumes\. For more information, see [Using Run Command to Take VSS\-Enabled Snapshots of EBS Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/storage-vss-snapshots.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances*\.  |  November 20, 2017  | 
|  Enhanced Systems Manager Security Available By Using VPC Endpoints  |  You can improve the security posture of your managed instances \(including managed instances in your hybrid environment\) by configuring Systems Manager to use an interface VPC endpoint\. Interface endpoints are powered by PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access Amazon EC2 and Systems Manager APIs by using private IP addresses\. PrivateLink restricts all network traffic between your managed instances, Systems Manager, and EC2 to the Amazon network \(managed instances don't have access to the Internet\)\. Also, you don't need an Internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway\. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Create a Virtual Private Cloud endpoint](setup-create-vpc.md)\.  |  November 7, 2017  | 
|  Inventory Support for Files, Services, Windows Roles, and the Windows Registry  |  SSM Inventory now supports gathering the following information from your managed instances\. [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-release-history.html) Before you attempt to collect information for these inventory types, update SSM Agent on the instances you want to inventory\. By running the latest version of SSM Agent, you ensure that you can collect metadata for all supported inventory types\. For information about how to update SSM Agent by using State Manager, see [Automatically update SSM Agent \(CLI\)](sysman-state-cli.md)\. For more information Inventory, see [Learn more about Systems Manager Inventory](sysman-inventory-about.md)\.  | November 6, 2017 | 
|  Updates to Automation documentation  |  Fixed several issues in the information about setting up and configuring access for Systems Manager Automation\. For more information, see [Getting started with Automation](automation-setup.md)\.  | October 31, 2017 | 
|  GitHub and Amazon S3 Integration  |  **Run remote scripts**: Systems Manager now supports downloading and running scripts from a private or public GitHub repository, and from Amazon S3\. Using either the `AWS-RunRemoteScript` pre\-defined SSM document or the `aws:downloadContent` plugin in a custom SSM document, you can run Ansible Playbooks and scripts in Python, Ruby, or PowerShell, to name a few\. These changes further enhance *infrastructure as code* when you use Systems Manager to automate configuration and deployment of EC2 instances and on\-premises managed instances in your hybrid environment\. For more information, see [Running scripts from GitHub](integration-remote-scripts.md) and [Running scripts from Amazon S3](integration-s3.md)\. **Create composite SSM documents**: Systems Manager now supports running one or more secondary SSM documents from a primary SSM document\. These primary documents that run other documents are called *composite* documents\. Composite documents enable you to create and share a standard set of secondary SSM documents across AWS accounts for common tasks such as boot\-strapping anti\-virus software or domain\-joining instances\. You can run composite and secondary documents stored in Systems Manager, GitHub, or Amazon S3\. After you create a composite document, you can run it by using the `AWS-RunDocument` pre\-defined SSM document\. For more information, see [Creating composite documents](composite-docs.md) and [Running Systems Manager command documents from remote locations](run-remote-documents.md)\. **SSM document plugin reference**: For easier access, we moved the SSM Plugin Reference for SSM documents out of the Systems Manager API Reference and into the User Guide\. For more information, see [Systems Manager Command document plugin reference](ssm-plugins.md)\.   | October 26, 2017 | 
|  Support for Parameter Versions in Parameter Store  |  When you edit a parameter, Parameter Store now automatically iterates the version number by 1\. You can specify a parameter name and a specific version number in API calls and SSM documents\. If you don't specify a version number, the system automatically uses the latest version\. Parameter versions provide a layer of protection in the event that a parameter is accidentally changed\. You can view the values of all versions, and reference older versions if necessary\. You can also use parameter versions to see how many times a parameter changed over a period of time\. For more information, see [Working with parameter versions](sysman-paramstore-versions.md)\.  | October 24, 2017 | 
|  Support for Tagging Systems Manager Documents  |  You can now use the [AddTagsToResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_AddTagsToResource.html) API, the AWS CLI, or the AWS Tools for PowerShell to tag Systems Manager documents with key\-value pairs\. Tagging helps you quickly identify specific resources based on the tags you've assigned to them\. This is in addition to existing tagging support for managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines\. For information, see [Tagging Systems Manager documents](tagging-documents.md)\.  | October 3, 2017 | 
|  Various Documentation Updates to Fix Errors or Update Content Based on Feedback  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-release-history.html)  |  October 2, 2017  | 
|  Troubleshoot Unreachable Windows Instances by Using the EC2Rescue Automation Workflow  |  EC2Rescue can help you diagnose and troubleshoot problems on Amazon EC2 Windows Server instances\. You can run the tool as a Systems Manager Automation workflow by using the **AWSSupport\-ExecuteEC2Rescue** document\. The **AWSSupport\-ExecuteEC2Rescue** document is designed to perform a combination of Systems Manager actions, AWS CloudFormation actions, and Lambda functions that automate the steps normally required to use EC2Rescue\. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Run the EC2Rescue tool on unreachable instances](automation-ec2rescue.md)\.  |  September 29, 2017  | 
|  SSM Agent Installed By Default on Amazon Linux  |  SSM Agent is installed, by default, on Amazon Linux AMIs dated 2017\.09 and later\. You must manually install SSM Agent on other versions of Linux, as described in [Installing and configuring SSM Agent on EC2 instances for Linux](sysman-install-ssm-agent.md)\.  |  September 27, 2017  | 
|  Run Command Enhancements  |  Run Command includes the following enhancements\. [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-release-history.html)  |  September 12, 2017  |

For more information, see [Sending SSM Agent logs to CloudWatch Logs](monitoring-ssm-agent.md)\.  |  September 7, 2017  | 
|  Encrypt Resource Data Sync  |  Systems Manager Resource Data Sync lets you aggregate Inventory data collected on dozens or hundreds of managed instance in a central S3 bucket\. You can now encrypt Resource Data Sync by using an AWS Key Management Service key\. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Use Resource Data Sync to aggregate inventory data](sysman-inventory-resource-data-sync.md)\.  |  September 1, 2017  | 
|  New State Manager Walkthroughs  |  Added two new walkthroughs to the State Manager documentation:  [Automatically update SSM Agent \(CLI\)](sysman-state-cli.md)   [Walkthrough: Automatically update PV drivers on EC2 instances for Windows Server \(console\)](sysman-state-pvdriver.md)   |  August 31, 2017  | 
|  Systems Manager Configuration Compliance  |  Use Configuration Compliance to scan your fleet of managed instances for patch compliance and configuration inconsistencies\. You can collect and aggregate data from multiple AWS accounts and Regions, and then drill down into specific resources that aren’t compliant\. By default, Configuration Compliance displays compliance data about Patch Manager patching and State Manager associations\. You can also customize the service and create your own compliance types based on your IT or business requirements\. For more information, see [AWS Systems Manager Configuration Compliance](systems-manager-compliance.md)\.  |  August 28, 2017  | 
|  New Automation Action: aws:executeAutomation  |  Runs a secondary Automation workflow by calling a secondary Automation document\. With this action, you can create Automation documents for your most common workflows, and reference those documents during an Automation execution\. This action can simplify your Automation documents by removing the need to duplicate steps across similar documents\. For more information, see [aws:executeAutomation – Run another automation execution](automation-action-executeAutomation.md)\.  |  August 22, 2017  | 
|  Automation as the Target of a CloudWatch Event  |  You can start an Automation workflow by specifying an Automation document as the target of an Amazon CloudWatch event\. You can start workflows according to a schedule, or when a specific AWS system event occurs\. For more information, see [Running automations with triggers using EventBridge](automation-cwe-target.md)\.  |  August 21, 2017  | 
|  State Manager Association Versioning and General Updates  |  You can now create different State Manager association versions\. There is a limit of 1,000 versions for each association\. You can also specify names for your associations\. Also, the State Manager documentation has been updated to address outdated information and inconsistencies\.

|  New Automation Action: aws:approve  |  This new action for Automation documents temporarily pauses an Automation execution until designated principals either approve or reject the action\. After the required number of approvals is reached, the Automation execution resumes\.  For more information, see [Systems Manager Automation actions reference](automation-actions.md)\.   |  August 10, 2017  | 
|  Automation Assume Role No Longer Required  |  Automation previously required that you specify a service role \(or *assume* role\) so that the service had permission to perform actions on your behalf\. Automation no longer requires this role because the service now operates by using the context of the user who invoked the execution\.  However, the following situations still require that you specify a service role for Automation: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-release-history.html) For more information, see [Getting started with Automation](automation-setup.md)\.  |  August 3, 2017  | 
|  Configuration Compliance  |  Use Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Configuration Compliance to scan your fleet of managed instances for patch compliance and configuration inconsistencies\. You can collect and aggregate data from multiple AWS accounts and Regions, and then drill down into specific resources that aren’t compliant\. For more information, see [AWS Systems Manager Configuration Compliance](systems-manager-compliance.md)\.  |  August 8, 2017  | 
|  SSM Document Enhancements  |  SSM Command and Policy documents now offer cross\-platform support\. This means that a single SSM document can process plugins for Windows and Linux operating systems\. Cross\-platform support enables you to consolidate the number of documents you manage\. Cross\-platform support is offered in SSM documents that use schema version 2\.2 or later\. SSM Command documents that use schema version 2\.0 or later can now include multiple plugins of the same type\. For example, you can create a Command document that calls the aws:runRunShellScript plugin multiple times\. For more information about schema version 2\.2 changes, see [AWS Systems Manager documents](sysman-ssm-docs.md)\. For more information about SSM plugins, see [Systems Manager Plugins](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/ssm-plugins.html)\.  |  July 12, 2017  | 
|  Linux Patching  |  Patch Manager can now patch the following Linux distributions: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-release-history.html) [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-release-history.html) For more information, see [AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager](systems-manager-patch.md)\.    To patch Linux instances, your instances must be running SSM Agent version 2\.0\.834\.0 or later\. For information about updating the agent, see the section titled *Example: Update SSM Agent* in [Running commands from the console](rc-console.md)\.   The AWS\-ApplyPatchBaseline SSM document is being replaced by the AWS\-RunPatchBaseline document\.     |  July 6, 2017  | 
|  Resource Data Sync  |  You can use Systems Manager Resource Data Sync to send Inventory data collected from all of your managed instances to a single Amazon S3 bucket\. Resource Data Sync then automatically updates the centralized data when new Inventory data is collected\. With all Inventory data stored in a target S3 bucket, you can use services like Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight to query and analyze the aggregated data\.For more information, see [Configuring Resource Data Sync for Inventory](sysman-inventory-datasync.md)\. For an example of how to work with Resource Data Sync, see [Walkthrough: Use Resource Data Sync to aggregate inventory data](sysman-inventory-resource-data-sync.md)\.  |  June 29, 2017  | 
|  Systems Manager Parameter Hierarchies  |  Managing dozens or hundreds of Systems Manager parameters as a flat list is time\-consuming and prone to errors\. You can use parameter hierarchies to help you organize and manage Systems Manager parameters\. A hierarchy is a parameter name that includes a path that you define by using forward slashes\. Here is an example that uses three hierarchy levels in the name to identify the following: /Environment/Type of computer/Application/Data 

```
/Dev/DBServer/MySQL/db-string13
``` For more information, see [Organizing parameters into hierarchies](sysman-paramstore-su-organize.md)\. For an example of how to work with parameter hierarchies, see [Walkthrough: Manage parameters using hierarchies \(AWS CLI\)](sysman-paramstore-walk-hierarchies.md)\.  |  June 22, 2017  |
