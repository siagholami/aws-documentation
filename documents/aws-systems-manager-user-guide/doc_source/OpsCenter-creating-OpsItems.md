When you initially configure OpsCenter by using Integrated Setup, you enable Amazon EventBridge to automatically create OpsItems based on common rules\. The procedures in this section describe how to configure a specific event or alarm to create OpsItems\. For information about enabling default EventBridge rules for creating OpsItems by using Integrated Setup, see [Getting started with Systems Manager Explorer and OpsCenter](Explorer-setup.md)\.
