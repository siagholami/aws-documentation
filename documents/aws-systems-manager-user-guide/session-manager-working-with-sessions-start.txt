Starting a session (Systems Manager console)
You can use the AWS Systems Manager console to start a session with an instance in your account.
Note
Before you start a session, make sure that you have completed the setup steps for Session Manager. For information, see Getting started with Session Manager.
To start a session ( Systems Manager console)


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Session Manager.


-or-
If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon () to open the navigation pane, and then choose Session Manager in the navigation pane.


Choose Start session.


For Target instances, choose the option button to the left of the instance you want to connect to.


If an instance you want to connect to is not in the list, or is listed but an error message reports, "The instance you selected is not configured to use Session Manager," see Instance not available or not configured for Session Manager for troubleshooting steps.

Choose Start session.

After the connection is made, you can run bash commands (Linux) or PowerShell commands (Windows) as you would through any other connection type.
Starting a session (Amazon EC2 console)
You can use the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) console to start a session with an instance in your account.
Note
If you receive an error that youâ€™re not authorized to perform one or more Systems Manager actions (ssm:command-name, then you must contact your administrator for assistance. Your administrator is the person that provided you with your user name and password. Ask that person to update your policies to allow you to start sessions from the Amazon EC2 console. If you are an administrator, see Quickstart default IAM policies for Session Manager for more information.
To start a session (Amazon EC2 console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances


Select the instance and choose Connect.


For Connection method, choose Session Manager.


Choose Connect.


After the connection is made, you can run bash commands (Linux) or PowerShell commands (Windows) as you would through any other connection type.
Starting a session (AWS CLI)
Install and configure the AWS CLI, if you have not already.
For information, see Install or upgrade AWS command line tools.
To start a session using the AWS CLI, run the following command:
Note
Before you start a session, make sure that you have completed the setup steps for Session Manager. For information, see Getting started with Session Manager.
To use the AWS CLI to run session commands, the Session Manager plugin must also be installed on your local machine. For information, see (Optional) Install the Session Manager Plugin for the AWS CLI.
aws ssm start-session \
    --target instance-id
instance-id represents of the ID of an instance configured for use with AWS Systems Manager and its Session Manager capability, such as i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE.
For information about other options you can use with the start-session command, see start-session in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference.
Starting a session (SSH)
To start a Session Manager SSH session, version 2.3.672.0 or later of SSM Agent must be installed on the managed instance.
SSH Connection Requirements
Take note of the following requirements and limitations for session connections using SSH.
 Your target instance must be configured to support SSH connections. For more information, see (Optional) Enable SSH connections through Session Manager.
 You must use the user on the instance associated with the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) certificate, not the ssm-user account that is used for other types of session connections. For example, on EC2 instances for Linux, the default user is ec2-user. For information about identifying the default user for each instance type, see Get Information About Your Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
 Logging and auditing are not available for Session Manager sessions that connect through port forwarding or SSH. This is because SSH encrypts all session data, and Session Manager only serves as a tunnel for SSH connections.
Note
Before you start a session, make sure that you have completed the setup steps for Session Manager. For information, see Getting started with Session Manager.
To start a session using SSH, run the following command:
ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem username@instance-id
/path/my-key-pair.pem represents the path to the PEM certificate that is associated with the instance. For example, for an EC2 instance, the key-pair file you created or selected when you created the instance.
username@instance-id represents the default user name for your instance type, and the instance ID, such as ec2-user@i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE.
Tip
When you start a session using SSH, you can copy local files to the target instance using the following command format.  
scp -i /path/my-key-pair.pem /path/SampleFile.txt username@instance-id:~
For information about other options you can use with the start-session command, see start-session in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference.
Starting a session (port forwarding)
To start a Session Manager port forwarding session, version 2.3.672.0 or later of SSM Agent must be installed on the managed instance.
Note
Before you start a session, make sure that you have completed the setup steps for Session Manager. For information, see Getting started with Session Manager.
To use the AWS CLI to run session commands, you must install the Session Manager plugin on your local machine. For information, see (Optional) Install the Session Manager Plugin for the AWS CLI.
Depending on your operating system and command line tool, the placement of quotation marks can differ and escape characters might be required.
To start a port forwarding session, run the following command from the CLI:

[ Linux ]
aws ssm start-session \
    --target instance-id \
    --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession \
    --parameters '{"portNumber":["80"], "localPortNumber":["56789"]}'

[ Windows ]
aws ssm start-session ^
    --target instance-id ^
    --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession ^
    --parameters portNumber="3389",localPortNumber="56789"

instance-id represents of the ID of an instance configured for use with AWS Systems Manager and its Session Manager capability, such as i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE.
portNumber represents the remote port on the instance where traffic should be redirected to, such as 3389. If this parameter is not specified, Session Manager assumes 80 as the default remote port. 
localPortNumber represents the local port on the client where traffic should be redirected to, such as 56789. 
For information about other options you can use with the start-session command, see start-session in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference.
For more information about port forwarding sessions, see Port Forwarding Using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager in the AWS News Blog.
Starting a session (interactive commands)
To start an Interactive Command session, run the following command:
Note
Before you start a session, make sure that you have completed the setup steps for Session Manager. For information, see Getting started with Session Manager.
To use the AWS CLI to run session commands, the Session Manager plugin must also be installed on your local machine. For information, see (Optional) Install the Session Manager Plugin for the AWS CLI.
aws ssm start-session \
    --target instance-id \
    --document-name CustomCommandSessionDocument \
    --parameters '{"logpath":["/var/log/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.log"]}'
instance-id represents of the ID of an instance configured for use with AWS Systems Manager and its Session Manager capability, such as i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE.
For information about other options you can use with the start-session command, see start-session in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference.
