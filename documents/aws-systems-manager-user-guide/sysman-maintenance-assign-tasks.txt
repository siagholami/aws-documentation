Assign tasks to a maintenance window (console)
In this procedure, you add a task to a maintenance window. Tasks are the actions performed on a resource during a maintenance window execution. 
The following four types of tasks can be added to a maintenance window:
 AWS Systems Manager Run Command commands
 Systems Manager Automation workflows
 AWS Lambda functions
 AWS Step Functions tasks
To assign tasks to a maintenance window


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Maintenance Windows. 


In the list of maintenance windows, choose a maintenance window.


Choose Actions, and then choose the option for the type of task you want to register with the maintenance window:
    Register Run command task
    Register Automation task
    Register Lambda task
    Register Step Functions task


For Name, enter a name for the task.


For Description, enter a description.


For Document, choose the SSM Command or Automation document that defines the tasks to run.


For Document version (for Automation tasks), choose the document version to use.


For Task priority, specify a priority for this task. Zero (0) is the highest priority. Tasks in a maintenance window are scheduled in priority order with tasks that have the same priority scheduled in parallel.


In the Targets section, identify the instances on which you want to run this operation by specifying tags, selecting instances manually, or specifying a resource group.
Note
If you choose to select instances manually, and an instance you expect to see is not included in the list, see Some of my instances are missing for troubleshooting tips.


(Optional) For Rate control:
    For Concurrency, specify either a number or a percentage of instances on which to run the command at the same time.
Note
If you selected targets by specifying tags applied to managed instances or by specifying AWS resource groups, and you are not certain how many instances are targeted, then restrict the number of instances that can run the document at the same time by specifying a percentage.
    For Error threshold, specify when to stop running the command on other instances after it fails on either a number or a percentage of instances. For example, if you specify three errors, then Systems Manager stops sending the command when the fourth error is received. Instances still processing the command might also send errors.


In the  IAM service role area, choose one of the following options to provide permissions for Systems Manager to run tasks on your target instances:
      Create and use a service-linked role for Systems Manager 
Service-linked roles provide a secure way to delegate permissions to AWS services because only the linked service can assume a service-linked role. Additionally, AWS automatically defines and sets the permissions of service-linked roles, depending on the actions that the linked service performs on your behalf.
Note
If a service-linked role has already been created for your account, choose Use the service-linked role for Systems Manager.
    Use a custom service role
You can create a custom service role for maintenance window tasks if you want to use stricter permissions than those provided by the service-linked role. 
If you need to create a custom service role, see one of the following topics:
  Control access to maintenance windows (console)
  Control access to maintenance windows (AWS CLI)
  Control access to maintenance windows (Tools for Windows PowerShell)


To help you decide whether to use a custom service role or the Systems Manager service-linked role with a maintenance window task, see Should I use a service-linked role or a custom service role to run maintenance window tasks?.


In the Input Parameters section, specify parameters for the document. For Automation documents, the system auto-populates some of the values. You can keep or replace these values.


Complete the wizard.
