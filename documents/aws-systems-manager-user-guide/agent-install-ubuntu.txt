Manually install SSM Agent on Ubuntu Server instances
Connect to your Ubuntu Server instance and perform the steps in one of following procedures to install SSM Agent on each instance that will run commands using Systems Manager.
About SSM Agent installations on 64-bit Ubuntu Server 16.04 instances
Beginning with instances created from Ubuntu Server 16.04 AMIs identified with 20180627, SSM Agent is pre-installed using Snap packages. For example: ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-20180627. On instances created from earlier AMIs, you should continue using deb installer packages. 
For instances created from a 64-bit Ubuntu Server 16.04 AMI, be sure to follow the correct procedure for your SSM Agent installation type:
 Instances created from AMIs with identifier 20180627 or later: Install SSM Agent on Ubuntu Server instances
 Instances created from AMIs earlier than 20180627: Install SSM Agent on Ubuntu Server instances
Important
Be aware that if an instance has more than one installation of the SSM Agent (for example, one installed using a Snap and one installed using a deb installer), your agent operations will not work correctly.
You can verify the source AMI ID creation date for an instance using either of the following methods. Note that these procedures apply only to AWS managed AMIs.
Verify a source AMI ID creation date (console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Instances.


Select an instance.


On the Description tab, check for a YYYYMMDD identifier in the value in the AMI ID field. For example: ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-20180627.


Verify a source AMI ID creation date (AWS CLI)
 Run the following command.
aws ec2 describe-images --image-id ami-id
ami-id represents the ID of an AMI provided by AWS, such as ami-07c8bc5c1ce9598c3.
If successful, the command returns information like the following, in which you can check the CreationDate and Name fields for information.
{
      "Images": [
          {
              "Architecture": "x86_64",
              "CreationDate": "2020-07-24T20:40:27.000Z",
              "ImageId": "ami-07c8bc5c1ce9598c3",
  -- truncated --
              "ImageOwnerAlias": "amazon",
              "Name": "amzn2-ami-hvm-2.0.20200722.0-x86_64-gp2",
              "RootDeviceName": "/dev/xvda",
              "RootDeviceType": "ebs",
              "SriovNetSupport": "simple",
              "VirtualizationType": "hvm"
          }
      ]

Install SSM Agent on Ubuntu Server instances

[ Ubuntu Server 18.04 and 16.04 LTS 64-bit (Snap) ]
To install SSM Agent on Ubuntu Server 18.04 and 16.04 LTS 64-bit instances (with Snap package)

SSM Agent is installed, by default, on Ubuntu Server 18.04 and on 16.04 LTS 64-bit AMIs with an identifier of 20180627 or later.

You can use the following script if you need to install SSM Agent on an on-premises server or if you need to reinstall the agent. You don't need to specify a URL for the download, because the snap command automatically downloads the agent from the Snap app store at https://snapcraft.io.
sudo snap install amazon-ssm-agent --classic
Important
The candidate channel in the Snap store contains the latest version of SSM Agent; not the stable channel. If you want to track SSM Agent version information on the candidate channel, run the following command on your Ubuntu Server 18.04 and 16.04 LTS 64-bit instances.  
sudo snap switch --channel=candidate amazon-ssm-agent
Note
Note the following details about SSM Agent on Ubuntu Server 18.04 and 16.04:
Because of a known issue with Snap, you might see a Maximum timeout exceeded error with snap commands. If you get this error, run the following commands one at a time to start the agent, stop it, and check its status:   
 ```
 sudo systemctl start snap.amazon-ssm-agent.amazon-ssm-agent.service
 ```

 ```
 sudo systemctl stop snap.amazon-ssm-agent.amazon-ssm-agent.service
 ```

 ```
 sudo systemctl status snap.amazon-ssm-agent.amazon-ssm-agent.service
 ```

On Ubuntu Server 18.04 and 16.04, SSM Agent installer files, including agent binaries and config files, are stored in the following directory: /snap/amazon-ssm-agent/current/. If you make changes to  any configuration files in this directory, then you must copy these files from the /snap folder to the /etc/amazon/ssm/ folder. Log and library files have not changed (/var/lib/amazon/ssm, /var/log/amazon/ssm).
On Ubuntu Server 18.04, use Snaps only. Don't install deb packages. Also verify that only one instance of the agent is installed and running on your instances.
On Ubuntu Server 18.04 and 16.04, SSM Agent provides support for the arm64 processor architecture.
On Ubuntu Server 16.04, SSM Agent is installed using either Snaps or deb installation packages, depending on the version of the 16.04 AMI.

Run the following command to determine if SSM Agent is running. 

sudo snap list amazon-ssm-agent

Run the following command to start the service if the previous command returned amazon-ssm-agent is stopped, inactive, or disabled.

sudo snap start amazon-ssm-agent

Check the status of the agent.

sudo snap services amazon-ssm-agent

[ Ubuntu Server 16.04 and 14.04 64-bit (deb) ]
To install SSM Agent on Ubuntu Server 16.04 and 14.04 64-bit instances (with deb installer package)

You can use the following script if you need to install SSM Agent on an on-premises server or if you need to reinstall the agent.
Important
SSM Agent is installed by default on instances created from Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS 64-bit AMIs with an identifier of 20180627 or later. Instances created from AMIs with earlier identifiers, for example 20171121.1 and 20180522, should continue to use deb installers. 
If SSM Agent is installed on your instance in conjunction with a Snap and you install or update SSM Agent using a deb installer package, the installation or SSM Agent operations may fail.

Create a temporary directory on the instance.
mkdir /tmp/ssm
Change to the temporary directory.
cd /tmp/ssm

https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/debian_386/amazon-ssm-agent.deb
Important
An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities. If an older version of the agent is running on an instance, some SSM Agent processes can fail. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up-to-date on your instances. For information, see Automating updates to SSM Agent. To be notified about SSM Agent updates, subscribe to the SSM Agent Release Notes page on GitHub.
