AWS-DisablePublicAccessForSecurityGroup
Description 
This document disables default SSH and RDP ports that are opened to all IP addresses.
Important
This document fails with an "InvalidPermission.NotFound" error for security groups that meet both of the following criteria: 1) The security group is located in a non-default VPC; and 2) The inbound rules for the security group don't specify open ports using all four of the following patterns: 
0.0.0.0/0
::/0
SSH or RDP port  0.0.0.0/0
SSH or RDP port  ::/0
If the security group is located in a non-default VPC and, for example, specifies open ports using only the SSH or RDP port  0.0.0.0/0 format, then the document fails to run.
