Deleting a Systems Manager Explorer Resource Data Sync
In Systems Manager Explorer, you can aggregate OpsData and OpsItems from other accounts and Regions by creating a resource data sync.
You can't change the account options for a resource data sync. For example, if you created a sync in the us-east-2 (Ohio) Region and you chose the Include only the current account option, you can't edit that sync later and choose the Include all accounts from my AWS Organizations configuration option. Instead, you must delete the resource data sync, and create a new one, as described in the following procedure.
To delete a resource data sync


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Explorer.


Choose Settings.


In the Configure resource data sync section, choose the resource data sync that you want to delete.


Choose Delete.
