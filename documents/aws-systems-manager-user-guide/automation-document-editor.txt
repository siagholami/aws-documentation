Creating an Automation document using the Editor
If the AWS Systems Manager public Automation documents don't perform all the actions you want to perform on your AWS resources, you can create your own documents. For example, you can use the editor to modify parameters, add additional steps to an existing Automation document, or combine multiple Automation documents into a single document. If you're familiar with writing your own Automation documents in JSON or YAML, you can use the editor to enter the JSON or YAML document content.
For examples of custom Automation documents, see Sample scenarios and custom Automation document solutions.
Note
If your Automation document uses the aws:executeScript Automation action with the Attachment input parameter, you must use the AWS CLI or Document Builder to successfully create the document.
The following procedure describes how to use the editor to create an Automation document.
