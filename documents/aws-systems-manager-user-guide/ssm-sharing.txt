Sharing SSM documents
You can share SSM documents privately or publicly with accounts in the same AWS Region. To privately share a document, you modify the document permissions and allow specific individuals to access it according to their Amazon Web Services (AWS) ID. To publicly share an SSM document, you modify the document permissions and specify All. 
Warning
Use shared SSM documents only from trusted sources. When using any shared document, carefully review the contents of the document before using it so that you understand how it will change the configuration of your instance. For more information about shared document best practices, see Best practices for shared SSM documents.
