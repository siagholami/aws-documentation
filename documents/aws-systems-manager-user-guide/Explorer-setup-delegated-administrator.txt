Configuring a Delegated Administrator
If you aggregate Explorer data from multiple AWS Regions and accounts by using resource data sync with AWS Organizations, then we suggest that you configure a delegated administrator for Explorer. A delegated administrator improves Explorer security in the following ways.
 You limit the number of Explorer administrators who can create or delete multi-account and Region resource data syncs to only one individual.
 You no longer need to be logged into the AWS Organizations master account to administer resource data syncs in Explorer.
For more information about resource data sync, see Setting up Systems Manager Explorer to display data from multiple accounts and Regions. For more information about AWS Organizations, see What is AWS Organizations? in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

The following list includes important information about Explorer delegated administration.
 You can delegate only one account for Explorer administration.
 The account ID that you specify as an Explorer delegated administrator must be listed as a member account in AWS Organizations. For more information, see Creating an AWS account in your organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
 A delegated adminstator can use all Explorer resource data sync API actions in the console or by using programmatic tools such as the SDK, the AWS CLI, or AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell. Resource data sync API actions include the following: CreateResourceDataSync, DeleteResourceDataSync, ListResourceDataSync, and UpdateResourceDataSync.
 A delegated administrator can search, filter, and aggregate Explorer data in the console or by using programmatic tools such as the SDK, the AWS CLI, or AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell. Search, filter, and data aggregation use the GetOpsSummary API action.
 Resource data syncs created by a delegated administrator are only available in the delegated administrator account. You can't view the syncs or the aggregated data in the AWS Organizations master account.
 A delegated administrator can create a maximum of five resource data syncs.
 A delegated administrator can create a resource data sync for either an entire organization in AWS Organizations or a subset of organizational units.
