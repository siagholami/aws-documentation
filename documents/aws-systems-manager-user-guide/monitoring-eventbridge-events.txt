Monitoring Systems Manager events with Amazon EventBridge
Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect your applications with data from a variety of sources. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from your own applications, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services and routes that data to targets such as AWS Lambda. You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your data to build application architectures that react in real time to all of your data sources. EventBridge allows you to build event driven architectures, which are loosely coupled and distributed.
EventBridge was formerly called Amazon CloudWatch Events. It includes new features that enable you to receive events from SaaS partners and your own applications. Existing CloudWatch Events users can access their existing default bus, rules, and events in the new EventBridge console and in the CloudWatch Events console. EventBridge uses the same CloudWatch Events API, so all of your existing CloudWatch Events API usage remains the same. 
In all, EventBridge can add events from nearly 40 AWS services to your rules, and targets from nearly 20 AWS services.
EventBridge provides support for both AWS Systems Manager events and Systems Manager targets.
