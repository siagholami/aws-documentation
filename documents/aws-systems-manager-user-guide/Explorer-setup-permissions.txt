Configuring roles and permissions for Systems Manager Explorer
Integrated Setup automatically creates and configures IAM roles for Systems Manager Explorer and OpsCenter. If you completed Integrated Setup, then you don't need to perform any additional tasks to configure roles and permissions for Explorer. However, you must configure permission for OpsCenter, as described later in this topic.

About the roles created by integrated setup
Integrated Setup creates and configures the following roles for working with Explorer and OpsCenter.
 AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM: Provides access to AWS Resources managed or used by Systems Manager.
 OpsItem-CWE-Role: Enables CloudWatch Events and EventBridge to create OpsItems in response to common events.
 AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM_AccountDiscovery: Enables Systems Manager to call other AWS services to discover AWS account information when synchronizing data. For more information about this role, see About the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM_AccountDiscovery role.
 AmazonSSMExplorerExport: Enables Explorer to export OpsData to a comma-separated value (CSV) file.
About the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM_AccountDiscovery role
If you configure Explorer to display data from multiple accounts and Regions by using AWS Organizations and a resource data sync, then Systems Manager creates a service-linked role. Systems Manager uses this role to get information about your AWS accounts in AWS Organizations. The role uses the following permissions policy.
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "organizations:DescribeAccount",
            "organizations:DescribeOrganization",
            "organizations:ListAccounts",
            "organizations:ListAWSServiceAccessForOrganization",
            "organizations:ListChildren",
            "organizations:ListParents"
         ],
         "Resource":"*"
      }
   ]
}
For more information about the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM_AccountDiscovery role, see Using Roles to Collect AWS Account Information for Systems Manager Explorer.
Configuring permissions for Systems Manager OpsCenter
After you complete Integrated Setup, you must configure IAM user, group, or role permissions so that users can perform actions in OpsCenter.
Before You Begin
OpsItems can only be viewed or edited in the account where they were created. You can't share or transfer OpsItems across AWS accounts. For this reason, we recommend that you configure permissions for OpsCenter in the AWS account that is used to run your AWS workloads. You can then create IAM users or groups in that account. In this way, multiple operations engineers or IT professionals can create, view, and edit OpsItems in the same AWS account.
Explorer and OpsCenter use the following API actions. You can use all features of Explorer and OpsCenter if your IAM user, group, or role has access to these actions. You can also create more restrictive access, as described later in this section.
  CreateOpsItem 
  CreateResourceDataSync 
  DescribeOpsItems 
  DeleteResourceDataSync 
  GetOpsItem 
  GetOpsSummary 
  ListResourceDataSync 
  UpdateOpsItem 
  UpdateResourceDataSync 
The following procedure describes how to add a full-access inline policy to an IAM user. If you prefer, you can specify read-only permission by assigning the following inline policy to a user's account, group, or role.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:GetOpsItem",
        "ssm:GetOpsSummary",
        "ssm:DescribeOpsItems"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
For more information about creating and editing IAM policies, see Creating IAM Policies in the IAM User Guide. For information about how to assign this policy to an IAM group, see Attaching a Policy to an IAM Group. 


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Users.


In the list, choose a name.


Choose the Permissions tab.


On the right side of the page, under Permission policies, choose Add inline policy. 


Choose the JSON tab.


Replace the default content with the following:


```
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "ssm:GetOpsItem",
           "ssm:UpdateOpsItem",
           "ssm:DescribeOpsItems",
           "ssm:CreateOpsItem",
           "ssm:CreateResourceDataSync",
           "ssm:DeleteResourceDataSync",
           "ssm:ListResourceDataSync",
           "ssm:UpdateResourceDataSync"
     ],
     "Resource": "*"
   }
 ]

}
   ```


Choose Review policy.


On the Review policy page, for Name, enter a name for the inline policy. For example: OpsCenter-Access-Full.


Choose Create policy.


Restricting access to OpsItems by using tags
You can also restrict access to OpsItems by using an inline IAM policy that specifies tags. The policy uses the following format. 
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "One_or_more_OpsItem_API_actions"
             ],
      "Resource": "*"
      ,
      "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "ssm:resourceTag/tag_key": "tag_value" } }
    }
  ]
}
Here is an example that specifies a tag key of Department and a tag value of Finance. With this policy, the user can only call the GetOpsItem API action to view OpsItems that were previously tagged with Key=Department and Value=Finance. Users can't view any other OpsItems.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:GetOpsItem"
             ],
      "Resource": "*"
      ,
      "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "ssm:resourceTag/Department": "Finance" } }
    }
  ]
}
Here is an example that specifies API actions for viewing and updating OpsItems. This policy also specifies two sets of tag key-value pairs: Department-Finance and Project-Unity.
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "ssm:GetOpsItem",
            "ssm:UpdateOpsItem"
         ],
         "Resource":"*",
         "Condition":{
            "StringEquals":{
               "ssm:resourceTag/Department":"Finance",
               "ssm:resourceTag/Project":"Unity"
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}
