Walkthrough: Create and test a String parameter (console)
The following procedure walks you through the process of creating a String parameter in Parameter Store and then running a command that uses this parameter.
To create a String parameter using Parameter Store


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Parameter Store. 


Choose Create parameter.


In the Name box, enter a hierarchy and a name. For example, enter /Test/helloWorld.


For more information about parameter hierarchies, see Organizing parameters into hierarchies.


In the Description field, enter a description that identifies this parameter as a test parameter.


For Type, choose String.


For Data type, leave the default selection text.


In the Value field, enter a string. For example, enter This is my first parameter.


Choose Create parameter.


In the navigation pane, choose Run Command. 


Choose Run command.


In the Command document list, choose AWS-RunPowerShellScript (Windows) or AWS-RunShellScript (Linux). 


For Command parameters, enter echo {{ssm:parameter-name}}. For example: echo {{ssm:/Test/helloWorld}}. 


In the Targets section, identify the instances on which you want to run this operation by specifying tags, selecting instances manually, or specifying a resource group.
Note
If you choose to select instances manually, and an instance you expect to see is not included in the list, see Some of my instances are missing for troubleshooting tips.


Choose Run.


In the Command ID page, in the Targets and outputs area, select the button next to the ID of an instance where you ran the command, and then choose View output. Verify that the output of the command is the value you provided for the parameter, such as This is my first parameter.
