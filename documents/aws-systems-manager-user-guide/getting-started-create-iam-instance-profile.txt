Create a custom IAM instance profile for Session Manager
You can create a custom IAM instance profile that provides permissions for only Session Manager actions on your instances. You can also create a policy to provide the permissions needed for logs of session activity to be sent to Amazon S3 and CloudWatch Logs.
After you create an instance profile, see Attaching an IAM Role to an Instance and Attach or Replace an Instance Profile for information about how to attach the instance profile to an instance, For more information about IAM instance profiles and roles, see Using Instance Profile and IAM roles for Amazon EC2 in the IAM User Guide.

About 'ssmmessages'
For information about ssmmessages, see Reference: ec2messages, ssmmessages, and other API calls.
About 'kms:Decrypt'
In this policy, the kms:Decrypt permission enables customer key encryption and decryption for session data. If you will use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption for your session data, replace key-name with the ARN of the customer master key (CMK) you want to use, in the format arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-12345EXAMPLE. 
If you will not use AWS KMS encryption for your session data, you can remove the following content from the policy:
,
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "kms:Decrypt"
               ],
               "Resource": "key-name"
           }
For information about using AWS KMS and a CMK to encrypt session data, see Enable AWS KMS key encryption of session data (console).

Important
To output session logs to an S3 bucket owned by a different AWS account, you must add the IAM s3:PutObjectAcl permission to this policy. If this permission isn't added, the account that owns the S3 bucket cannot access the session output logs.
