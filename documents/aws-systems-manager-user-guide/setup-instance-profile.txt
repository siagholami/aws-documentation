Step 4: Create an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager
By default, AWS Systems Manager doesn't have permission to perform actions on your instances. You must grant access by using an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance profile. An instance profile is a container that passes IAM role information to an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance at launch. You can create an instance profile for Systems Manager by attaching one or more IAM policies that define the necessary permissions to a new role or to a role you already created.
Note
You can use Systems Manager Quick Setup to quickly configure an instance profile on all instances in your AWS account. Quick Setup also creates an IAM service role (or assume role), which enables Systems Manager to securely run commands on your instances on your behalf. By using Quick Setup, you can skip this step (Step 4) and Step 5. For more information, see AWS Systems Manager Quick Setup. 
Note the following details about creating an IAM instance profile:
 If you are configuring servers or virtual machines (VMs) in a hybrid environment for Systems Manager, you don't need to create an instance profile for them. Instead, you must configure your servers and VMs to use an IAM service role. For more information, see Create an IAM service role for a hybrid environment.
 If you change the IAM instance profile, it might take some time for the instance credentials to refresh. SSM Agent will not process requests until this happens. To speed up the refresh process, you can restart SSM Agent or restart the instance.
About policies for a Systems Manager instance profile
This section describes the policies you can add to your EC2 instance profile for Systems Manager. To provide permissions for communication between instances and the Systems Manager API, we recommend creating custom policies that take into account your system needs and security requirements. However, as a starting point, you can use one or more of the following policies to grant permission for Systems Manager to interact with your instances. The first policy, AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore, enables an instance to use AWS Systems Manager service core functionality. Depending on your operations plan, you might need permissions represented in one or more of the other three policies.
Policy: AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
Required permissions.
This AWS managed policy enables an instance to use Systems Manager service core functionality.
Policy: A custom policy for S3 bucket access
Required permissions in either of the following cases:
 Case 1: You are using a VPC endpoint to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink. 
SSM Agent is Amazon software that is installed on your instances and performs Systems Manager tasks. This agent requires access to specific Amazon-owned S3 buckets. These buckets are publicly accessible. 
In a private VPC endpoint environment, however, you must explicitly provide access to these buckets:
arn:aws:s3:::patch-baseline-snapshot-region/*
  arn:aws:s3:::aws-ssm-region/*
For more information, see Step 6: (Optional) Create a Virtual Private Cloud endpoint, About minimum S3 Bucket permissions for SSM Agent, and VPC Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
 Case 2: You plan to use an S3 bucket that you create as part of your Systems Manager operations.
Your EC2 instance profile for Systems Manager must grant access to an S3 bucket that you own for tasks like the following: 
   To access scripts you store in the S3 bucket to use in commands you run.
   To store the full output of Run Command commands or Session Manager sessions.
   To access custom patch lists for use when patching your instances.
Saving output log data in an S3 bucket is optional, but we recommend setting it up at the beginning of your Systems Manager configuration process if you have decided to do so. For more information, see Create a Bucket in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Getting Started Guide.
Policy: AmazonSSMDirectoryServiceAccess
Required only if you plan to join EC2 instance for Windows Server to a Microsoft AD directory.
This AWS managed policy allows SSM Agent to access AWS Directory Service on your behalf for requests to join the domain by the managed instance. For more information, see Seamlessly Join a Windows EC2 Instance in the AWS Directory Service Administration Guide.
Policy: CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy
Required only if you plan to install and run the CloudWatch agent on your instances to read metric and log data on an instance and write it to Amazon CloudWatch. These help you monitor, analyze, and quickly respond to issues or changes to your AWS resources.
Your instance profile needs this policy only if you will use features such as Amazon EventBridge or CloudWatch Logs. (You can also create a more restrictive policy that, for example, limits writing access to a specific CloudWatch Logs log stream.)
Using EventBridge and CloudWatch Logs features is optional, but we recommend setting them up at the beginning of your Systems Manager configuration process if you have decided to use them. For more information, see the Amazon EventBridge User Guide and the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide.

Task 1: (Optional) Create a custom policy for S3 bucket access
Creating a custom policy for Amazon S3 access is required only if you are using a VPC endpoint or using an S3 bucket of your own in your Systems Manager operations.
For information about the AWS managed S3 buckets you provide access to in the policy below, see About minimum S3 Bucket permissions for SSM Agent.


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Policies, and then choose Create policy. 


Choose the JSON tab, and replace the default text with the following:

1 The first Statement element is required only if you are using a VPC endpoint.
2 The second Statement element is required only if you are using an S3 bucket that you created to use in your Systems Manager operations.
3 The PutObjectAcl access control list permission is required only if you plan to support cross-account access to S3 buckets in other accounts.
4 The GetEncryptionConfiguration element is required if your S3 bucket is configured to use encryption.
5 If your S3 bucket is configured to use encryption, then the S3 bucket root (for example, arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET) must be listed in the Resource section. Your IAM user, group, or role must be configured with access to the root bucket.

If you are using a VPC endpoint in your operations, do the following: 

In the first Statement element, replace each region placeholder with the identifier of the AWS Region this policy will be used in. For example, use us-east-2 for the US East (Ohio) Region. For a list of supported region values, see the Region column in Systems Manager service endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
Important
We recommend that you avoid using wildcard characters (*) in place of specific Regions in this policy. For example, use arn:aws:s3:::aws-ssm-us-east-2/* and do not use arn:aws:s3:::aws-ssm-*/*. Using wildcards could provide access to S3 buckets that you donâ€™t intend to grant access to. If you want to use the instance profile for more than one Region, we recommend repeating the first Statement element for each Region.
-or-
If you are not using a VPC endpoint in your operations, you can delete the first Statement element.

If you are using an S3 bucket of your own in your Systems Manager operations, do the following:

In the second Statement element, replace DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET with the name of an S3 bucket in your account. You will use this bucket for your Systems Manager operations. It provides permission for objects in the bucket, using "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*" as the resource. For more information about providing permissions for buckets or objects in buckets, see the topic Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide and the AWS blog post IAM Policies and Bucket Policies and ACLs! Oh, My! (Controlling Access to S3 Resources).
Note
If you use more than one bucket, provide the ARN for each one. For example, for permissions on buckets:  
"Resource": [
   "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1/*",
   "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET2/*"
                  ]
-or-
If you are not using an S3 bucket of your own in your Systems Manager operations, you can delete the second Statement element.
