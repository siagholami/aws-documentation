Document history
The following table describes the important changes to the documentation since the last release of AWS Systems Manager. For notification about updates to this documentation, you can subscribe to an RSS feed.
Important
An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities. If an older version of the agent is running on an instance, some SSM Agent processes can fail. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up-to-date on your instances. For information, see Automating updates to SSM Agent. To be notified about SSM Agent updates, subscribe to the SSM Agent Release Notes page on GitHub.

Multiple changes for re:Invent 2017
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
November 29, 2017


Using Run Command to Take VSS-Enabled Snapshots of EBS Volumes
Using Run Command, you can take application-consistent snapshots of all Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes attached to your Amazon EC2 Windows instances. The snapshot process uses the Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) to take image-level backups of VSS-aware applications, including data from pending transactions between these applications and the disk. Furthermore, you don't need to shut down your instances or disconnect them when you need to back up all attached volumes. For more information, see Using Run Command to Take VSS-Enabled Snapshots of EBS Volumes in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances.
November 20, 2017


Enhanced Systems Manager Security Available By Using VPC Endpoints
You can improve the security posture of your managed instances (including managed instances in your hybrid environment) by configuring Systems Manager to use an interface VPC endpoint. Interface endpoints are powered by PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access Amazon EC2 and Systems Manager APIs by using private IP addresses. PrivateLink restricts all network traffic between your managed instances, Systems Manager, and EC2 to the Amazon network (managed instances don't have access to the Internet). Also, you don't need an Internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway. For more information, see (Optional) Create a Virtual Private Cloud endpoint.
November 7, 2017


Inventory Support for Files, Services, Windows Roles, and the Windows Registry
SSM Inventory now supports gathering the following information from your managed instances. [See the AWS documentation website for more details] Before you attempt to collect information for these inventory types, update SSM Agent on the instances you want to inventory. By running the latest version of SSM Agent, you ensure that you can collect metadata for all supported inventory types. For information about how to update SSM Agent by using State Manager, see Automatically update SSM Agent (CLI). For more information Inventory, see Learn more about Systems Manager Inventory.

Updates to Automation documentation
Fixed several issues in the information about setting up and configuring access for Systems Manager Automation. For more information, see Getting started with Automation.
October 31, 2017


GitHub and Amazon S3 Integration
Run remote scripts: Systems Manager now supports downloading and running scripts from a private or public GitHub repository, and from Amazon S3. Using either the AWS-RunRemoteScript pre-defined SSM document or the aws:downloadContent plugin in a custom SSM document, you can run Ansible Playbooks and scripts in Python, Ruby, or PowerShell, to name a few. These changes further enhance infrastructure as code when you use Systems Manager to automate configuration and deployment of EC2 instances and on-premises managed instances in your hybrid environment. For more information, see Running scripts from GitHub and Running scripts from Amazon S3. Create composite SSM documents: Systems Manager now supports running one or more secondary SSM documents from a primary SSM document. These primary documents that run other documents are called composite documents. Composite documents enable you to create and share a standard set of secondary SSM documents across AWS accounts for common tasks such as boot-strapping anti-virus software or domain-joining instances. You can run composite and secondary documents stored in Systems Manager, GitHub, or Amazon S3. After you create a composite document, you can run it by using the AWS-RunDocument pre-defined SSM document. For more information, see Creating composite documents and Running Systems Manager command documents from remote locations. SSM document plugin reference: For easier access, we moved the SSM Plugin Reference for SSM documents out of the Systems Manager API Reference and into the User Guide. For more information, see Systems Manager Command document plugin reference.
October 26, 2017


Support for Parameter Versions in Parameter Store
When you edit a parameter, Parameter Store now automatically iterates the version number by 1. You can specify a parameter name and a specific version number in API calls and SSM documents. If you don't specify a version number, the system automatically uses the latest version. Parameter versions provide a layer of protection in the event that a parameter is accidentally changed. You can view the values of all versions, and reference older versions if necessary. You can also use parameter versions to see how many times a parameter changed over a period of time. For more information, see Working with parameter versions.
October 24, 2017


Support for Tagging Systems Manager Documents
You can now use the AddTagsToResource API, the AWS CLI, or the AWS Tools for PowerShell to tag Systems Manager documents with key-value pairs. Tagging helps you quickly identify specific resources based on the tags you've assigned to them. This is in addition to existing tagging support for managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. For information, see Tagging Systems Manager documents.
