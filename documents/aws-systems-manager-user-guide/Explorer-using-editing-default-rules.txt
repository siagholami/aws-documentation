Editing default rules for OpsItems
When you complete Integrated Setup, the system enables more than a dozen rules in Amazon EventBridge. These rules automatically create OpsItems in Systems Manager OpsCenter. Systems Manager Explorer then displays aggregated information about the OpsItems.
Each rule includes a preset Category and Severity value. When the system creates OpsItems from an event, it automatically assigns the preset Category and Severity.
Important
Currently, you can't edit the Category and Severity values for default rules but you can edit these values on OpsItems created from the default rules. 

To edit default rules for creating OpsItems


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Explorer.


Choose Settings.


In the OpsItems rules section, choose Edit.


Expand CWE rules.


Clear the check box beside those rules that you don't want to use.


Use the Category and Severity lists to change this information for a rule. 


Choose Save.


Your changes take effect the next time the system creates an OpsItem.
