Share a Change Calendar entry
You can share a Change Calendar entry with other AWS accounts by using the AWS Management Console. When you share a calendar, the calendar is read-only to users in the shared account.


Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.


In the navigation pane, choose Change Calendar.


In the Change Calendar list, choose the name of the calendar entry that you want to share.


On the calendar entry's details page, choose Share.


In Share calendar, for Account ID, enter the ID number of a valid AWS account, and then choose Share.


Users of the shared account can read the Change Calendar, but cannot make changes.
