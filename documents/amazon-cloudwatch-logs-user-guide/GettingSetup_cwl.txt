Getting Set Up
To use Amazon CloudWatch Logs you need an AWS account. Your AWS account allows you to use services (for example, Amazon EC2) to generate logs that you can view in the CloudWatch console, a web-based interface. In addition, you can install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
Sign Up for Amazon Web Services (AWS)
When you create an AWS account, we automatically sign up your account for all AWS services. You pay only for the services that you use.
If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next step. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one.
