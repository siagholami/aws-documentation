Tutorial: Run and Modify a Sample Query
The following tutorial helps you get started with CloudWatch Logs Insights. You run a sample query, and then see how to modify and rerun it.
To run a query, you must already have logs stored in CloudWatch Logs. If you are already using CloudWatch Logs and have log groups and log streams set up, you are ready to start. You may also already have logs if you use services such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon RouteÂ 53, or Amazon VPC and you have set up logs from those services to go to CloudWatch Logs. For more information about sending logs to CloudWatch Logs, see Getting Started with CloudWatch Logs.
Queries in CloudWatch Logs Insights return either a set of fields from log events or the result of a mathematical aggregation or other operation performed on log events. This tutorial demonstrates a query that returns a list of log events.
Run a Sample Query
Start by running a sample query.
To run a CloudWatch Logs Insights sample query


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Insights.


Near the top of the page is the query editor. When you first open CloudWatch Logs Insights, this box contains a default query that returns the 20 most recent log events.

Select one or more log groups to query, above the query editor. To help find your log groups, you can enter text in the search bar and CloudWatch Logs displays matching log groups in the search bar.

When you select a log group, CloudWatch Logs Insights automatically detects fields in the data in the log group. To see these discovered fields, select Fields on the right of the page. 


(Optional) Use the time selector at the upper right to select the time period that you want to query.


Choose Run.


The results of the query appear. In this example, the results are the most recent 20 log events of any type.
CloudWatch Logs also displays a bar graph of log events in this log group over time. This bar graph shows the distribution of events in the log group that matches your query and time range, not just the events displayed in the table.

To see all fields of one of the returned log events, choose the icon to the left of that log event.

Modify the Sample Query
In this tutorial, you modify the sample query to show the 50 most recent log events.
If you haven't already run the previous tutorial, do that now. This tutorial starts where that previous tutorial ends.
Note
Some sample queries provided with CloudWatch Logs Insights use head or tail commands instead of limit. These commands are being deprecated and have been replaced with limit. Use limit instead of head or tail in all queries that you write.
To modify the CloudWatch Logs Insights sample query

In the query editor, change 20 to 50, and then choose Run.

The results of the new query appear. Assuming there is enough data in the log group in the default time range, there are now 50 log events listed.

(Optional) You can save queries that you have created. To save this query, choose Save. For more information, see Saving and Re-running CloudWatch Logs Insights Queries.

Add a Filter Command to the Sample Query
This tutorial shows how to make a more powerful change to the query in the query editor. In this tutorial, you filter the results of the previous query based on a field in the retrieved log events.
If you haven't already run the previous tutorials, do that now. This tutorial starts where that previous tutorial ends.
To add a filter command to the previous query

Decide on a field to filter. To see the most common fields that CloudWatch Logs has detected in the log events contained in the selected log groups in the past 15 minutes, and the percentage of those log events in which each field appears, select Fields on the right side of the page.

To see the fields contained in a particular log event, choose the icon to the left of that row.
The awsRegion field might appear in your log event, depending on which events are in your logs. For the rest of this tutorial, we use awsRegion as the filter field, but you can use a different field if that field isn't available.


In the query editor box, place your cursor after 50 and press Enter.


On the new line, first enter | (the pipe character) and a space. Commands in a CloudWatch Logs Insights query must be separated by the pipe character.


Enter filter awsRegion="us-east-1".


Choose Run.


The query runs again, and now displays the 50 most recent results that match the new filter.
If you filtered on a different field and got an error result, you might need to escape the field name. If the field name includes non-alphanumeric characters, you must put backtick characters (\) before and after the field name \(for example, **error-code`="102"**).
You must use the backtick characters for field names that contain non-alphanumeric characters, but not for values. Values are always contained in quotation marks (").
CloudWatch Logs Insights includes powerful query abilities, including several commands and support for regular expressions, mathematical, and statistical operations. For more information, see CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax.
