CloudWatch Logs Permissions Reference
When you are setting up Access Control and writing permissions policies that you can attach to an IAM identity (identity-based policies), you can use the following table as a reference. The table lists each CloudWatch Logs API operation and the corresponding actions for which you can grant permissions to perform the action. You specify the actions in the policy's Action field. For the Resource field, you can specify the ARN of a log group or log stream, or specify * to represent all CloudWatch Logs resources.
You can use AWS-wide condition keys in your CloudWatch Logs policies to express conditions. For a complete list of AWS-wide keys, see AWS Global and IAM Condition Context Keys in the IAM User Guide.
Note
To specify an action, use the logs: prefix followed by the API operation name. For example: logs:CreateLogGroup, logs:CreateLogStream, or logs:* (for all CloudWatch Logs actions).
