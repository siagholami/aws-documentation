Search Log Data Using Filter Patterns
You can search your log data using the Filter and Pattern Syntax. You can search all the log streams within a log group, or by using the AWS CLI you can also search specific log streams. When each search runs, it returns up to the first page of data found and a token to retrieve the next page of data or to continue searching. If no results are returned, you can continue searching.
You can set the time range you want to query to limit the scope of your search. You could start with a larger range to see where the log lines you are interested in fall, and then shorten the time range to scope the view to logs in the time range that interest you.
You can also pivot directly from your logs-extracted metrics to the corresponding logs.
Search Log Entries Using the Console
You can search for log entries that meet a specified criteria using the console.
To search your logs using the console


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Log groups.


For Log Groups, choose the name of the log group containing the log stream to search.


For Log Streams, choose the name of the log stream to search.


Under Log events, enter the filter syntax to use.


To search all log entries for a time range using the console


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Log groups.


For Log Groups, choose the name of the log group containing the log stream to search.


Choose Search log group.


For Log events, select the date and time range, and enter the filter syntax.


Search Log Entries Using the AWS CLI
You can search for log entries that meet a specified criteria using the AWS CLI.
To search log entries using the AWS CLI
At a command prompt, run the following filter-log-events command. Use --filter-pattern to limit the results to the specified filter pattern and --log-stream-names to limit the results to the specified log group.
aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name my-group [--log-stream-names LIST_OF_STREAMS_TO_SEARCH] --filter-pattern VALID_METRIC_FILTER_PATTERN]
To search log entries over a given time range using the AWS CLI
At a command prompt, run the following filter-log-events command:
aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name my-group [--log-stream-names LIST_OF_STREAMS_TO_SEARCH] [--start-time 1482197400000] [--end-time 1482217558365] [--filter-pattern VALID_METRIC_FILTER_PATTERN]
Pivot from Metrics to Logs
You can get to specific log entries from other parts of the console.
To get from dashboard widgets to logs


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Dashboards.


Choose a dashboard.


On the widget, choose the View logs icon, and then choose View logs in this time range. If there is more than one metric filter, select one from the list. If there are more metric filters than we can display in the list, choose More metric filters and select or search for a metric filter.


To get from metrics to logs


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Metrics.


In the search field on the All metrics tab, type the name of the metric and press Enter.


Select one or more metrics from the results of your search.


Choose Actions, View logs. If there is more than one metric filter, select one from the list. If there are more metric filters than we can display in the list, choose More metric filters and select or search for a metric filter.


Troubleshooting
Search takes too long to complete
If you have a lot of log data, search might take a long time to complete. To speed up a search, you can do the following:
 If you are using the AWS CLI, you can limit the search to just the log streams you are interested in. For example, if your log group has 1000 log streams, but you just want to see three log streams that you know are relevant, you can use the AWS CLI to limit your search to only those three log streams within the log group.
 Use a shorter, more granular time range, which reduces the amount of data to be searched and speeds up the query.
