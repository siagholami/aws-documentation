# Use the Unified CloudWatch Agent to Get Started With CloudWatch Logs<a name="UseCloudWatchUnifiedAgent"></a>

For more information about using the unified CloudWatch agent to get started with CloudWatch Logs, see [Collect Metrics and Logs from Amazon EC2 Instances and On\-Premises Servers with the CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\. You complete the steps listed in this section to install, configure, and start the agent\. If you are not using the agent to also collect CloudWatch metrics, you can ignore any sections that refer to metrics\. 

If you are currently using the older CloudWatch Logs agent and want to migrate to using the new unified agent, we recommend that you use the wizard included in the new agent package\. This wizard can read your current CloudWatch Logs agent configuration file and set up the CloudWatch agent to collect the same logs\. For more information about the wizard, see [ Create the CloudWatch Agent Configuration File with the Wizard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file-wizard.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
