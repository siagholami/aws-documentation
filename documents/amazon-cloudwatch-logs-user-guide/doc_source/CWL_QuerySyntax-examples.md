# Sample Queries<a name="CWL_QuerySyntax-examples"></a>

This section includes example queries that show the power of CloudWatch Logs Insights\.

**General Queries**

Find the 25 most recently added log events\.

```
fields @timestamp, @message | sort @timestamp desc | limit 25
```

Get a list of the number of exceptions per hour\.

```
filter @message like /Exception/ 
    | stats count(*) as exceptionCount by bin(1h)
    | sort exceptionCount desc
```

Get a list of log events that aren't exceptions\.

```
fields @message | filter @message not like /Exception/
```

**Queries for Lambda Logs**

Determine the amount of overprovisioned memory\.

```
filter @type = "REPORT"
    | stats max(@memorySize / 1024 / 1024) as provisonedMemoryMB,
        min(@maxMemoryUsed / 1024 / 1024) as smallestMemoryRequestMB,
        avg(@maxMemoryUsed / 1024 / 1024) as avgMemoryUsedMB,
        max(@maxMemoryUsed / 1024 / 1024) as maxMemoryUsedMB,
        provisonedMemoryMB - maxMemoryUsedMB as overProvisionedMB
```

Create a latency report\.

```
filter @type = "REPORT" |
    stats avg(@duration), max(@duration), min(@duration) by bin(5m)
```

**Queries for Amazon VPC Flow Logs**

Find the top 15 packet transfers across hosts:

```
stats sum(packets) as packetsTransferred by srcAddr, dstAddr
    | sort packetsTransferred  desc
    | limit 15
```

Find the top 15 byte transfers for hosts on a given subnet\.

```
filter isIpv4InSubnet(srcAddr, "192.0.2.0/24")
    | stats sum(bytes) as bytesTransferred by dstAddr
    | sort bytesTransferred desc
    | limit 15
```

Find the IP addresses that use UDP as a data transfer protocol\.

```
filter protocol=17 | stats count(*) by srcAddr
```

Find the IP addresses where flow records were skipped during the capture window\.

```
filter logStatus="SKIPDATA"
    | stats count(*) by bin(1h) as t
    | sort t
```

**Queries for RouteÂ 53 Logs**

Find the distribution of records per hour by query type\.

```
stats count(*) by queryType, bin(1h)
```

Find the 10 DNS resolvers with the highest number of requests\.

```
stats count(*) as numRequests by resolverIp
    | sort numRequests desc
    | limit 10
```

Find the number of records by domain and subdomain where the server failed to complete the DNS request\.

```
filter responseCode="SERVFAIL" | stats count(*) by queryName
```

**Queries for CloudTrail Logs**

Find the number of log entries for each service, event type, and AWS Region\.

```
stats count(*) by eventSource, eventName, awsRegion
```

Find the Amazon EC2 hosts that were started or stopped in a given AWS Region\.

```
filter (eventName="StartInstances" or eventName="StopInstances") and region="us-east-2"
```

Find the AWS Regions, user names, and ARNs of newly created IAM users\.

```
filter eventName="CreateUser"
    | fields awsRegion, requestParameters.userName, responseElements.user.arn
```

Find the number of records where an exception occurred while invoking the API `UpdateTrail`\.

```
filter eventName="UpdateTrail" and ispresent(errorCode)
    | stats count(*) by errorCode, errorMessage
```

**Examples of the parse command**

Use a glob expression to extract the ephemeral fields `@user`, `@method`, and `@latency` from the log field `@message` and return the average latency for each unique combination of `@method` and `@user`\.

```
parse @message "user=*, method:*, latency := *" as @user,
    @method, @latency | stats avg(@latency) by @method,
    @user
```

Use a regular expression to extract the ephemeral fields `@user2`, `@method2`, and `@latency2` from the log field `@message` and return the average latency for each unique combination of `@method2` and `@user2`\.

```
parse @message /user=(?<user2>.*?), method:(?<method2>.*?),
    latency := (?<latency2>.*?)/ | stats avg(@latency2) by @method2, 
    @user2
```

Extracts the ephemeral fields `loggingTime`, `loggingType` and `loggingMessage`, filters down to log events that contain `ERROR` or `INFO` strings, and then displays only the `loggingMessage` and `loggingType` fields for events that contain an `ERROR` string\.

```
FIELDS @message
    | PARSE @message "* [*] *" as loggingTime, loggingType, loggingMessage
    | FILTER loggingType IN ["ERROR", "INFO"]
    | DISPLAY loggingMessage, loggingType = "ERROR" as isError
```
