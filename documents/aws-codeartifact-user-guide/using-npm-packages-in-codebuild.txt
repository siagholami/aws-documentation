Using npm packages in CodeBuild
The steps below have been tested with the operating systems listed in Docker images provided by CodeBuild.
Set up permissions with IAM roles
These steps are required when using npm packages from CodeArtifact in CodeBuild.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles. On the Roles page, edit the role used by your CodeBuild build project. This role must have the following permissions.


{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
         {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Action": [ "codeartifact:GetAuthorizationToken",
                         "codeartifact:GetRepositoryEndpoint",
                         "codeartifact:ReadFromRepository"
                         ],
             "Resource": "*"
         },
         {       
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Action": "sts:GetServiceBearerToken",
             "Resource": "*",
             "Condition": {
                 "StringEquals": {
                     "sts:AWSServiceName": "codeartifact.amazonaws.com"
                 }
             }
         }
     ]
   }
Important
 If you also want to use CodeBuild to publish packages, add the codeartifact:PublishPackageVersion permission. 
For information, see Modifying a Role in the IAM User Guide.
Log in and use npm
To use npm packages from CodeBuild, run the login command from the pre-build section of your project's buildspec.yaml to configure npm to fetch packages from CodeArtifact. For more information, see Authentication with npm.
After login has run successfully, you can run npm commands from the build section to install npm packages.
Linux
Note
It is only necessary to upgrade the AWS CLI with pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user if you are using an older CodeBuild image. If you are using the latest image versions, you can remove that line.
pre_build:
  commands:
    - pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user
    - aws codeartifact login --tool npm --domain my-domain --domain-owner domain-owner-id --repository my-repo
build:
  commands:
    - npm install
Windows

phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - '[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = "Tls12"; Invoke-WebRequest https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi -OutFile $env:TEMP/AWSCLIV2.msi'
      - Start-Process -Wait msiexec "/i $env:TEMP\AWSCLIV2.msi /quiet /norestart"
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - '&"C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2\aws" codeartifact login --tool npm --domain my-domain --domain-owner domain-owner-id --repository my-repo'
  build:
    commands:
      - npm install
