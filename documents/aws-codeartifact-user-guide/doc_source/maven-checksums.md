# Using Maven checksums<a name="maven-checksums"></a>

 When a Maven artifact is published to an AWS CodeArtifact repository, the checksum associated with each *asset* or file in the package is used to validate the upload\. Assets are *jar*, *pom*, and *war* files\. For each asset, the Maven artifact contains multiple checksum files that use the asset name with an additional extension, such as `md5` or `sha1`\. For example, the checksum files for a file named `my-maven-package.jar` might be `my-maven-package.jar.md5` and `my-maven-package.jar.sh1`\. 

**Note**  
 Maven uses the term `artifact`\. In this guide, a Maven package is the same as a Maven artifact\. For more information, see [AWS CodeArtifact package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/welcome.html#welcome-concepts-package)\. 

 Every Maven artifact also contains a `maven-metadata.xml` file\. This file must be uploaded for a publish to succeed\. If a checksum mismatch is detected during the upload of any artifact file, the publish stops\. This might prevent the `maven-metadata.xml` from being uploaded\. When that happens, the status of the Maven artifact is set to `Unfinished`\. You cannot download assets that are part of a package with this status\. 

Keep the following in mind in the event of a checksum mismatch when you publish a Maven package: 
+  If the checksum mismatch occurs before `maven-metadata.xml` is uploaded, the status of the package is not set to `Unfinished`\. The package is not visible and its assets cannot be consumed\. When this happens, try one of the following, and then try to download the asset again\. 
  + Run the command that publishes the Maven artifact again\. This might work if a network issue corrupted the checksum file during download\. If the network issue is resolved for the retry, the checksum matches and the download is successful\. 
  +  If republishing the Maven artifact doesn't work, delete the package and then republish it\. For more information, see [DeletePackageVersions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/APIReference/API_DeletePackageVersions.html) in the *AWS CodeArtifact API Reference*\. 
+  If the checksum mismatch occurs after `maven-metadata.xml` is uploaded, the status of the package is set to `Published`\. You can consume any asset from the package, including those with checksum mismatches\. When you download an asset, the checksum generated by AWS CodeArtifact is downloaded with it\. If the downloaded file is associated with a checksum mismatch, its downloaded checksum file might not match the checksum that was uploaded when the package was published\.
