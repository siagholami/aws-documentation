# Data encryption<a name="security-encryption"></a>

 Encryption is an important part of CodeArtifact security\. Some encryption, such as for data in transit, is provided by default and does not require you to do anything\. Other encryption, such as for data at rest, you can configure when you create your project or build\. 
+  **Encryption of data at rest** \- All assets stored in CodeArtifact are encrypted by using *customer master keys* \(CMKs\)\. This includes all assets in all packages in all repositories\. One CMK is used for each domain to encrypt all its assets\. By default, an AWS managed CMK is used, so you do not need to create a CMK\. If you want, you can use a customer\-managed CMK that you create and configure\. For more information, see [Creating keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) and [AWS Key Management Service concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service User Guide*\. You can specify a customer\-managed CMK when you create a domain\. For more information, see [Working with domains in CodeArtifact](domains.md)\. 
+  **Encryption of data in transit** \- All communication between customers and CodeArtifact and between CodeArtifact and its downstream dependencies is protected using an authorization token\.
