 You can improve the security of your CodeArtifact domains and the assets that they contain by configuring CodeArtifact to use an interface virtual private cloud \(VPC\) endpoint\. To do this, you don't need an internet gateway, NAT device, or virtual private gateway\. For more information, see [Working with Amazon VPC endpoints](vpc-endpoints.md)\. For more information about AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints, see [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) and [Accessing AWS Services Through PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Introduction.html#what-is-privatelink)\.
