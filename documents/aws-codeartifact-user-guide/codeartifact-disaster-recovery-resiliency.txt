Resilience in AWS CodeArtifact
The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. AWS CodeArtifact operates in multiple Availability Zones and stores artifact data and metadata in Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. Your encrypted data is redundantly stored across multiple facilities and multiple devices in each facility, making it highly available and highly durable.
