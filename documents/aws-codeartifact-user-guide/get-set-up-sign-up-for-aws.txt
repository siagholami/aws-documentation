Sign up for AWS
When you sign up for Amazon Web Services (AWS), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including CodeArtifact. You are charged only for the services that you use. With CodeArtifact, you pay only for what you use.
If you already have an AWS account, skip to the next task, Install or upgrade and then configure the AWS CLI. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one.
