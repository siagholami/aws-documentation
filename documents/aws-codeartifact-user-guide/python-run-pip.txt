Run pip
After you configure pip, you can run pip commands. Assuming that a package is present in your repository or one of its upstream repositories, you can install it with pip install. For example, use the following command to install the requests package.
pip install requests
Use the -i option to temporarily revert to installing packages from https://pypi.org instead of your CodeArtifact repository.
pip install -i https://pypi.org/simple requests
