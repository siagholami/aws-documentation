Delete a repository
You can delete a repository using the CodeArtifact console or the AWS CLI. After a repository has been deleted, you can no longer push packages to it or pull packages from it. All packages in the repository become permanently unavailable and cannot be restored. You can create a repository with the same name, but its contents are empty.
