* The manual snapshot limit cannot be changed.
** The maximum supported age of a manual snapshot is 180 days and cannot be changed. This is due to the Tombstone-Lifetime attribute of deleted objects which defines the useful shelf life of a system-state backup of Active Directory. It is not possible to restore from a snapshot older than 180 days. For more information, see Useful shelf life of a system-state backup of Active Directory on the Microsoft website.
