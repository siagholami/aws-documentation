Linux Domain Join Errors
The following can help you troubleshoot some error messages you might encounter when joining an EC2 Linux instance to your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.
Linux instances unable to join domain or authenticate
Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, and 18.04 instances must be reverse-resolvable in the DNS before a realm can work with Microsoft AD. Otherwise, you might encounter one of the following two scenarios:
Scenario 1: Ubuntu instances that are not yet joined to a realm
For Ubuntu instances that are attempting to join a realm, the sudo realm join command might not provide the required permissions to join the domain and might display the following error:
! Couldn't authenticate to active directory: SASL(-1): generic failure: GSSAPI Error: An invalid name was supplied (Success) adcli: couldn't connect to EXAMPLE.COM domain: Couldn't authenticate to active directory: SASL(-1): generic failure: GSSAPI Error: An invalid name was supplied (Success) ! Insufficient permissions to join the domain realm: Couldn't join realm: Insufficient permissions to join the domain
Scenario 2: Ubuntu instances that are joined to a realm
For Ubuntu instances that are already joined to a Microsoft AD domain, attempts to SSH into the instance using the domain credentials might fail with following errors:
$ ssh admin@EXAMPLE.COM@198.51.100
no such identity: /Users/username/.ssh/id_ed25519: No such file or directory
admin@EXAMPLE.COM@198.51.100's password:
Permission denied, please try again.
admin@EXAMPLE.COM@198.51.100's password:
If you log in to the instance with a public key and check /var/log/auth.log, you might see the following errors about being unable to find the user:
May 12 01:02:12 ip-192-0-2-0 sshd[2251]: pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=203.0.113.0
May 12 01:02:12 ip-192-0-2-0 sshd[2251]: pam_sss(sshd:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=203.0.113.0 user=admin@EXAMPLE.COM
May 12 01:02:12 ip-192-0-2-0 sshd[2251]: pam_sss(sshd:auth): received for user admin@EXAMPLE.COM: 10 (User not known to the underlying authentication module)
May 12 01:02:14 ip-192-0-2-0 sshd[2251]: Failed password for invalid user admin@EXAMPLE.COM from 203.0.113.0 port 13344 ssh2
May 12 01:02:15 ip-192-0-2-0 sshd[2251]: Connection closed by 203.0.113.0 [preauth]
However, kinit for the user still works. See this example:
ubuntu@ip-192-0-2-0:\~$ kinit admin@EXAMPLE.COM Password for admin@EXAMPLE.COM: ubuntu@ip-192-0-2-0:\~$ klist Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1000 Default principal: admin@EXAMPLE.COM
Workaround
The current recommended workaround for both of these scenarios is to disable reverse DNS in /etc/krb5.conf in the [libdefaults] section as shown below:
[libdefaults]
default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM
rdns = false
One-Way Trust Authentication Issue with Seamless Domain Join
If you have a one-way outgoing trust established between your AWS Managed Microsoft AD and your on-premises AD, you might encounter an authentication issue when attempting to authenticate against the domain joined Linux instance using your trusted AD credentials with Winbind.

Workaround
To resolve this issue, you will need to comment out or remove a directive from the PAM module configuration file (/etc/security/pam_winbind.conf) using the following steps.

Open the /etc/security/pam_winbind.conf file in a text editor.

sudo vim /etc/security/pam_winbind.conf

Comment out or remove the following directive krb5_auth = yes.

```
   [global]
cached_login = yes
   krb5_ccache_type = FILE
   #krb5_auth = yes
   ```

Stop the Winbind service, and then start it again.

service winbind stop or systemctl stop winbind
   net cache flush 
   service winbind start or systemctl start winbind
