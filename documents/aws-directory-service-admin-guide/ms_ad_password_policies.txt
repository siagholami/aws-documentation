Manage Password Policies for AWS Managed Microsoft AD
AWS Managed Microsoft AD enables you to define and assign different fine-grained password and account lockout policies (also referred to as fine-grained password policies) for groups of users you manage in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain. When you create an AWS Microsoft AD directory, a default domain policy is created and applied to the directory. This policy includes the following settings:




Policy
Setting




Enforce password history
24 passwords remembered


Maximum password age
42 days *


Minimum password age
1 day


Minimum password length
7 characters


Password must meet complexity requirements
Enabled


Store passwords using reversible encryption
Disabled



* Note: The 42 day maximum password age includes the admin password. 
For example, you can assign a less strict policy setting for employees that have access to low sensitivity information only. For senior managers who regularly access confidential information you can apply more strict settings. 
AWS provides a set of fine-grained password policies in AWS Managed Microsoft AD that you can configure and assign to your groups. To configure the policies, you can use standard Microsoft policy tools such as Active Directory Administrative Center (ADAC). To get started with the Microsoft policy tools, see Installing the Active Directory Administration Tools.
