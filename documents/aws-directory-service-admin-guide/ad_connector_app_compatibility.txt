Application Compatibility Policy for AD Connector
As an alternative to AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD), AD Connector is an Active Directory proxy for AWS created applications and services only. You configure the proxy to use a specified Active Directory domain. When the application must look up a user or group in Active Directory, AD Connector proxies the request to the directory. Similarly, when a user logs in to the application, AD Connector proxies the authentication request to the directory. There are no third-party applications that work with AD Connector.
The following is a list of compatible AWS applications and services:
 Amazon Chime - For detailed instructions, see Connect to Your Active Directory.
 Amazon Connect - For more information, see How Amazon Connect Works.
 Amazon EC2 for Windows or Linux – You can use the seamless domain join feature of Amazon EC2 Windows or Linux to join your instance to your self-managed Active Directory (on-premises). Once joined, the instance communicates directly with your Active Directory and bypasses AD Connector. For more information, see Join an EC2 Instance to Your AD Connector Directory.
 AWS Management Console – You can use AD Connector to authenticate AWS Management Console users with their Active Directory credentials without setting up SAML infrastructure. For more information, see Enable Access to the AWS Management Console with AD Credentials.
 Amazon QuickSight - For more information, see Managing User Accounts in Amazon QuickSight Enterprise Edition.
 AWS Single Sign-On - For detailed instructions, see Connect AWS SSO to an On-Premises Active Directory.
 Amazon WorkDocs - For detailed instructions, see Connecting to Your On-Premises Directory with AD Connector.
 Amazon WorkMail - For detailed instructions, see Integrate Amazon WorkMail with an Existing Directory (Standard Setup).
 Amazon WorkSpaces - For detailed instructions, see Launch a WorkSpace Using AD Connector.

Amazon RDS is compatible with AWS Managed Microsoft AD only, and is not compatible with AD Connector. For more information, see the AWS Microsoft AD section in the AWS Directory Service FAQs page.
