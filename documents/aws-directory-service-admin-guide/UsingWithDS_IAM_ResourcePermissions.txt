AWS Directory Service API Permissions: Actions, Resources, and Conditions Reference
When you are setting up Access Control and writing permissions policies that you can attach to an IAM identity (identity-based policies), you can use the following table as a reference. The the following:
 Each AWS Directory Service API operation
 The corresponding actions for which you can grant permissions to perform the action
 The AWS resource for which you can grant the permissions
You specify the actions in the policy's Action field and the resource value in the policy's Resource field. 
Note
Some AWS applications may require use of nonpublic AWS Directory Service API operations such as ds:AuthorizeApplication, ds:CheckAlias, ds:CreateIdentityPoolDirectory, and ds:UnauthorizeApplication in their policies.
You can use AWS global condition keys in your AWS Directory Service policies to express conditions. For a complete list of AWS keys, see Available Global Condition Keys in the IAM User Guide. 
Note
To specify an action, use the ds: prefix followed by the API operation name (for example, ds:CreateDirectory).
