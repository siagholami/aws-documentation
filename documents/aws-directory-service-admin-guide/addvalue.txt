(Optional) Add a value to the new attribute
Use this optional step when you have created a new attribute and want to add a new value to the attribute in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.
To add a value to an attribute

Open the Windows PowerShell command line utility and set the new attribute with the following command. In this example, we will add a new EC2InstanceID value to the attribute for a specific computer.

PS C:\> set-adcomputer -Identity computer name -add @{example-EC2InstanceID = 'EC2 instance ID'}

You can validate if the EC2InstanceID value was added to the computer object by running the following command:

PS C:\> get-adcomputer -Identity computer name â€“Property example-EC2InstanceID
