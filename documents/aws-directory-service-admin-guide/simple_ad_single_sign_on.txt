Single Sign-On
AWS Directory Service provides the ability to allow your users to access Amazon WorkDocs from a computer joined to the directory without having to enter their credentials separately. 
Before you enable single sign-on, you need to take additional steps to enable your users web browsers to support single sign-on. Users may need to modify their web browser settings to enable single sign-on. 
Note
Single sign-on only works when used on a computer that is joined to the AWS Directory Service directory. It cannot be used on computers that are not joined to the directory.
If your directory is an AD Connector directory and the AD Connector service account does not have the permission to add or remove its service principal name attribute, then for Steps 5 and 6 below, you have two options:


You can proceed and will be prompted for the user name and password for a directory user that has this permission to add or remove the service principal name attribute on the AD Connector service account. These credentials are only used to enable single sign-on and are not stored by the service. The AD Connector service account permissions are not changed.


You can delegate permissions to allow the AD Connector service account to add or remove the service principal name attribute on itself, you can run the below PowerShell commands from a domain joined computer using an account that has permissions to modify the permissions on the AD Connector service account. The below command will give the AD Connector service account the ability to add and remove a service principal name attribute only for itself.


```
$AccountName = 'ConnectorAccountName'

```
