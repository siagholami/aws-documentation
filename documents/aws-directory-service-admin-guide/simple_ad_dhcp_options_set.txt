Create a DHCP Options Set
AWS recommends that you create a DHCP options set for your AWS Directory Service directory and assign the DHCP options set to the VPC that your directory is in. This allows any instances in that VPC to point to the specified domain and DNS servers to resolve their domain names.
For more information about DHCP options sets, see DHCP Options Sets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
To create a DHCP options set for your directory


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose DHCP Options Sets, and then choose Create DHCP options set.


On the Create DHCP options set page, enter the following values for your directory:
Name
An optional tag for the options set.
Domain name
The fully qualified name of your directory, such as corp.example.com.
Domain name servers
The IP addresses of your AWS-provided directory's DNS servers. 
You can find these addresses by going to the AWS Directory Service console navigation pane, selecting Directories and then choosing the correct directory ID.
NTP servers
Leave this field blank.
NetBIOS name servers
Leave this field blank.
NetBIOS node type
Leave this field blank.


Choose Create DHCP options set. The new set of DHCP options appears in your list of DHCP options.


Make a note of the ID of the new set of DHCP options (dopt-xxxxxxxx). You use it to associate the new options set with your VPC.


To change the DHCP options set associated with a VPC
After you create a set of DHCP options, you can't modify them. If you want your VPC to use a different set of DHCP options, you must create a new set and associate them with your VPC. You can also set up your VPC to use no DHCP options at all.


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Your VPCs


Select the VPC, and then choose Actions, Edit DHCP options set.


For DHCP options set, select an options set or choose No DHCP options set, and then choose Save.
