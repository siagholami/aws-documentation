Step 3: Verify the Trust
In this section, you test whether the trusts were set up successfully between AWS and Active Directory on Amazon EC2.
To verify the trust


Open the AWS Directory Service console.


Choose the corp.example.com directory.


On the Directory details page, select the Networking & security tab.


In the Trust relationships section, select the trust relationship you just created.


Choose Actions, and then choose Verify trust relationship.


Once the verification has completed, you should see Verified displayed under the Status column. 
Congratulations on completing this tutorial! You now have a fully functional multiforest Active Directory environment from which you can begin testing various scenarios. Additional test lab tutorials are planned in 2018, so check back on occasion to see what's new.
