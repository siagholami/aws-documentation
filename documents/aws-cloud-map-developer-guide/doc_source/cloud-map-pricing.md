# AWS Cloud Map Pricing<a name="cloud-map-pricing"></a>

AWS Cloud Map pricing is based on resources that you register in the service registry and API calls that you make to discover them\. With AWS Cloud Map there are no upfront payments, and you only pay for what you use\.

Optionally, you can enable DNS\-based discovery for the resources with IP addresses\. You can also enable health checking for your resources using Amazon Route 53 health checks, whether you're discovering instances using API calls or DNS queries\. You will incur additional charges related to Route 53 DNS and health check usage\.
