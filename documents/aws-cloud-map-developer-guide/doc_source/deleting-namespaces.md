# Deleting Namespaces<a name="deleting-namespaces"></a>

When you delete a namespace, you can no longer use it to register or discover service instances\. Note the following:
+ Before you can delete a namespace, you must delete all the services that were created in the namespace\. For more information, see [Deleting Services](deleting-services.md)\.
+ Before you can delete a service, you must deregister all the service instances that were registered using the service\. For more information, see [Deregistering Service Instances](deregistering-instances.md)\.
+ When you create a namespace, if you specify that you want to discover service instances using either public DNS queries or DNS queries in VPCs, AWS Cloud Map creates an Amazon RouteÂ 53 public or private hosted zone\. When you delete the namespace, AWS Cloud Map deletes the corresponding hosted zone\.
