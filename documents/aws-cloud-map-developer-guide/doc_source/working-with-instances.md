# Working with Service Instances<a name="working-with-instances"></a>

A service instance contains information about how to locate a resource, such as a web server, for an application\. After you register instances, you locate them by using DNS queries or the AWS Cloud Map [DiscoverInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_DiscoverInstances.html) API action\.
