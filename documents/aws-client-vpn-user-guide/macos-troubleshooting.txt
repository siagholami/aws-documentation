MacOS troubleshooting
The following are problems you might have when using MacOS-based clients to connect to a Client VPN endpoint.
Topics
 AWS-provided client
 Tunnelblick
 OpenVPN
AWS-provided client
The AWS-provided client creates event logs and stores them in the following location on your computer.
/Users/username/.config/AWSVPNClient/logs
The following types of logs are available:
 Application logs: Contain information about the application. These logs are prefixed with 'aws_vpn_client_'.
 OpenVPN logs: Contain information about OpenVPN processes. These logs are prefixed with 'ovpn_aws_vpn_client_'.
The AWS-provided client uses the client daemon to perform root operations. The daemon logs are stored in the following locations on your computer.
/tmp/AcvcHelperErrLog.txt
/tmp/AcvcHelperOutLog.txt
The AWS-provided client stores the configuration files in the following location on your computer.
/Users/username/.config/AWSVPNClient/OpenVpnConfigs
Topics
 Client cannot connect
 Client is stuck in a reconnecting state
 Client cannot create profile
Client cannot connect
Problem
The AWS-provided client cannot connect to the Client VPN endpoint.
Cause
The cause of this problem might be one of the following:
 Another OpenVPN process is already running on your computer, which prevents the client from connecting.
 Your configuration (.ovpn) file is invalid.
Solution
Check that there are no other OpenVPN applications running on your computer. If there are, stop or quit these processes and try connecting to the Client VPN endpoint again. Check the OpenVPN logs for errors, and ask your Client VPN administrator to verify the following information:
 The configuration file contains the correct client key and certificate. For more information, see Export Client Configuration in the AWS Client VPN Administrator Guide.
 The CRL is still valid. For more information, see Clients Unable to Connect to a Client VPN Endpoint in the AWS Client VPN Administrator Guide.
Client is stuck in a reconnecting state
Problem
The AWS-provided client is trying to connect to the Client VPN endpoint, but is stuck in a reconnecting state.
Cause
The cause of this problem might be one of the following:
 You computer is not connected to the internet.
 The DNS hostname does not resolve to an IP address.
 An OpenVPN process is indefinitely trying to connect to the endpoint.
Solution
Check that your computer is connected to the internet. Ask your Client VPN administrator to verify that the remote directive in the configuration file resolves to a valid IP address. You can also disconnect the VPN session by choosing Disconnect in the AWS VPN Client window, and try connecting again.
Client cannot create profile
Problem
You get the following error when you try to create a profile using the AWS-provided client.
The config should have either cert and key or auth-user-pass specified.
Cause
If the Client VPN endpoint uses mutual authentication, the configuration (.ovpn) file does not contain the client certificate and key.
Solution
Ensure that your Client VPN administrator adds the client certificate and key to the configuration file. For more information, see Export Client Configuration in the AWS Client VPN Administrator Guide.
Tunnelblick
The following troubleshooting information was tested on version 3.7.8 (build 5180) of the Tunnelblick software on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.
The configuration file for private configurations is stored in the following location on your computer.
/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick/Configurations
The configuration file for shared configurations is stored in the following location on your computer.
/Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick/Shared
The connection logs are stored in the following location on your computer.
/Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick/Logs
To increase the log verbosity, open the Tunnelblick application, choose Settings, and adjust the value for VPN log level.
Cipher algorithm 'AES-256-GCM' not found
Problem
The connection fails and returns the following error in the logs.
2019-04-11 09:37:14 Cipher algorithm 'AES-256-GCM' not found
2019-04-11 09:37:14 Exiting due to fatal error
Cause
The application is using an OpenVPN version that doesn't support cipher algorithm AES-256-GCM.
Solution
Choose a compatible OpenVPN version by doing the following:


Open the Tunnelblick application.


Choose Settings.


For OpenVPN version, choose 2.4.6 - OpenSSL version is v1.0.2q.


Connection hangs and resets
Problem
The connection fails and returns the following error in the logs.
MANAGEMENT: >STATE:1559117927,WAIT,,,,,,
MANAGEMENT: >STATE:1559117928,AUTH,,,,,,

VERIFY EKU OK
VERIFY OK: depth=0, CN=server-cvpn
Connection reset, restarting [0]
SIGUSR1[soft,connection-reset] received, process restarting
Cause
The client certificate has been revoked. The connection hangs after trying to authenticate and is eventually reset from the server side.
Solution
Request a new configuration file from your Client VPN administrator.
Invalid certificate
Problem
The connection fails and returns the following error in the logs.
VERIFY ERROR: depth=1, error=unable to get issuer certificate: C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=Let's Encrypt Authority X3
OpenSSL: error:14090086:SSL routines:ssl3_get_server_certificate:certificate verify failed

TLS Error: TLS handshake failed
Fatal TLS error (check_tls_errors_co), restarting
SIGUSR1[soft,tls-error] received, process restarting
Cause
The issuer certificate is not valid in the .ovpn configuration file.
Solution
Open the Client VPN configuration file (the .ovpn file) in a text editor, and add the following certificate to the file.
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

Extended key usage (EKU)
Problem
The connection fails and returns the following error in the logs.
TLS: Initial packet from [AF_INET]50.19.205.135:443, sid=29f2c917 4856ad34
VERIFY OK: depth=2, O=Digital Signature Trust Co., CN=DST Root CA X3

Connection reset, restarting [0]
SIGUSR1[soft,connection-reset] received, process restarting
MANAGEMENT: >STATE:1559138717,RECONNECTING,connection-reset,,,,,
Cause
The server authentication succeeded. However, the client authentication fails because the client certificate has the extended key usage (EKU) field enabled for server authentication.
Solution
Ensure that you are using correct client certificate and key. If necessary, verify with your Client VPN administrator. This error might occur if you're using the server certificate and not the client certificate to connect to the Client VPN endpoint.
Expired certificate
Problem
The server authentication succeeds but the client authentication fails with the following error.
WARNING: “Connection reset, restarting [0] , SIGUSR1[soft,connection-reset] received, process restarting”
Cause
The client certificate validity has expired.
Solution
Request a new client certificate from your Client VPN administrator.
