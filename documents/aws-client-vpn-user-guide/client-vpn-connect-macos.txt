The following procedure shows how to establish a VPN connection using the AWS-provided client for macOS. You can download and install the client at AWS Client VPN download.
Requirements
To use the AWS-provided client for macOS, the following is required:
 macOS High Sierra (10.13), Mojave (10.14), or Catalina (10.15)
The client reserves TCP port 8096 on your computer. For Client VPN endpoints that use SAML-based federated authentication (single sign-on) the client reserves TCP port 35001.
