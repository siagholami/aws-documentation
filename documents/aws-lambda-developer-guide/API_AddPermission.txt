AddPermission
Grants an AWS service or another account permission to use a function. You can apply the policy at the function level, or specify a qualifier to restrict access to a single version or alias. If you use a qualifier, the invoker must use the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of that version or alias to invoke the function.
To grant permission to another account, specify the account ID as the Principal. For AWS services, the principal is a domain-style identifier defined by the service, like s3.amazonaws.com or sns.amazonaws.com. For AWS services, you can also specify the ARN of the associated resource as the SourceArn. If you grant permission to a service principal without specifying the source, other accounts could potentially configure resources in their account to invoke your Lambda function.
This action adds a statement to a resource-based permissions policy for the function. For more information about function policies, see Lambda Function Policies.

URI Request Parameters
The request uses the following URI parameters.
 FunctionName  
The name of the Lambda function, version, or alias.  
Name formats
  Function name - my-function (name-only), my-function:v1 (with alias).
  Function ARN - arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function.
  Partial ARN - 123456789012:function:my-function.
You can append a version number or alias to any of the formats. The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 140.
Pattern: (arn:(aws[a-zA-Z-]*)?:lambda:)?([a-z]{2}(-gov)?-[a-z]-\d{1}:)?(\d{12}:)?(function:)?([a-zA-Z0-9-_])(:(\$LATEST|[a-zA-Z0-9-_]))? 
Required: Yes
 Qualifier  
Specify a version or alias to add permissions to a published version of the function.
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.
Pattern: (|[a-zA-Z0-9$_-]) 
Request Body
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 Action  
The action that the principal can use on the function. For example, lambda:InvokeFunction or lambda:GetFunction.
Type: String
Pattern: (lambda:[*]|lambda:[a-zA-Z]|[*]) 
Required: Yes
 EventSourceToken  
For Alexa Smart Home functions, a token that must be supplied by the invoker.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9._\-] 
Required: No
 Principal  
The AWS service or account that invokes the function. If you specify a service, use SourceArn or SourceAccount to limit who can invoke the function through that service.
Type: String
Pattern: .* 
Required: Yes
 RevisionId  
Only update the policy if the revision ID matches the ID that's specified. Use this option to avoid modifying a policy that has changed since you last read it.
Type: String
Required: No
 SourceAccount  
For Amazon S3, the ID of the account that owns the resource. Use this together with SourceArn to ensure that the resource is owned by the specified account. It is possible for an Amazon S3 bucket to be deleted by its owner and recreated by another account.
Type: String
Pattern: \d{12} 
Required: No
 SourceArn  
For AWS services, the ARN of the AWS resource that invokes the function. For example, an Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon SNS topic.
Type: String
Pattern: arn:(aws[a-zA-Z0-9-]*):([a-zA-Z0-9\-]):([a-z]{2}(-gov)?-[a-z]-\d{1})?:(\d{12})?:(.*) 
Required: No
 StatementId  
A statement identifier that differentiates the statement from others in the same policy.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 100.
Pattern: ([a-zA-Z0-9-_]) 
Required: Yes
