Using environment variables
To access environment variables in Go, use the Getenv function.
The following explains how to do this. Note that the function imports the fmt package to format the printed results and the os package, a platform-independent system interface that allows you to access environment variables.
```
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
)
func main() {
    fmt.Printf("%s is %s. years old\n", os.Getenv("NAME"), os.Getenv("AGE"))
}
```
For a list of environment variables that are set by the Lambda runtime, see Runtime environment variables.
