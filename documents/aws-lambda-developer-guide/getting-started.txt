Getting started with AWS Lambda
To get started with AWS Lambda, use the Lambda console to create a function. In a few minutes, you can create a function, invoke it, and view logs, metrics, and trace data. 
Note
To use Lambda and other AWS services, you need an AWS account. If you don't have an account, visit aws.amazon.com and choose Create an AWS Account. For detailed instructions, see Create and activate an AWS account.
As a best practice, you should also create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user with administrator permissions and use that for all work that does not require root credentials. Create a password for console access, and access keys to use command line tools. See Creating your first IAM admin user and group in the IAM User Guide for instructions.
You can author functions in the Lambda consoleâ€”or with an IDE toolkit, command line tools, or SDKs. The Lambda console provides a code editor for noncompiled languages that lets you modify and test code quickly. The AWS CLI gives you direct access to the Lambda API for advanced configuration and automation use cases.
