# API Gateway proxy integration with Node.js

This sample application is a Lambda function that processes events from an API Gateway REST API. The API provides a public endpoint that you can access with a web browser or other HTTP client. When you send a request to the endpoint, the API serializes the request and sends it to the function. The function calls the Lambda API to get utilization data and returns it to the API in the required format.

:warning: The application creates a public API endpoint that is accessible over the internet. When you're done testing, run the cleanup script to delete it.

The project source includes function code and supporting resources:

- `function` - A Node.js function.
- `template.yml` - An AWS CloudFormation template that creates an application.
- `1-create-bucket.sh`, `2-deploy.sh`, etc. - Shell scripts that use the AWS CLI to deploy and manage the application.

Use the following instructions to deploy the sample application.

# Requirements
- [Node.js 10 with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)
- The Bash shell. For Linux and macOS, this is included by default. In Windows 10, you can install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to get a Windows-integrated version of Ubuntu and Bash.
- [The AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) v1.17 or newer.

If you use the AWS CLI v2, add the following to your [configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) (`~/.aws/config`):

```
cli_binary_format=raw-in-base64-out
```

This setting enables the AWS CLI v2 to load JSON events from a file, matching the v1 behavior.

# Setup
Download or clone this repository.

    $ git clone https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-lambda-developer-guide.git
    $ cd aws-lambda-developer-guide/sample-apps/nodejs-apig

To create a new bucket for deployment artifacts, run `1-create-bucket.sh`.

    nodejs-apig$ ./1-create-bucket.sh
    make_bucket: lambda-artifacts-a5e491dbb5b22e0d

# Deploy
To deploy the application, run `2-deploy.sh`.

    nodejs-apig$ ./2-deploy.sh

This script uses AWS CloudFormation to deploy the Lambda functions and an IAM role. If the AWS CloudFormation stack that contains the resources already exists, the script updates it with any changes to the template or function code.

# Test
To invoke the function directly with a test event (`event.json`), run `3-invoke.sh`.

    nodejs-apig$ ./3-invoke.sh
    {
        "StatusCode": 200,
        "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST"
    }

Let the script invoke the function a few times and then press `CRTL+C` to exit.

To invoke the function with the REST API, run the `4-get.sh` script. This script uses cURL to send a GET request to the API endpoint.

    nodejs-apig$ ./4-get.sh
    > GET /api/ HTTP/1.1
    > Host: mf2fxmplbj.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
    > Accept: */*
    >
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Type: application/json
    < Content-Length: 55
    < Connection: keep-alive

    }

The application uses AWS X-Ray to trace requests. Open the [X-Ray console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home#/service-map) to view the service map. The following service map shows the function invoked in two ways.

![Service Map](/sample-apps/nodejs-apig/images/nodejs-apig-servicemap.png)

Choose a node in the main function graph. Then choose **View traces** to see a list of traces. Choose any trace to view a timeline that breaks down the work done by the function.

Finally, view the application in the Lambda console.

*To view the application*
1. Open the [applications page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/applications) in the Lambda console.
2. Choose **nodejs-apig**.

# Cleanup
To delete the application, run `5-cleanup.sh`.

    nodejs-apig$ ./5-cleanup.sh
