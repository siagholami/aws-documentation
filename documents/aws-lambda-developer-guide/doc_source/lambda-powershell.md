**Note**  
To get started with application development in your local environment, deploy one of the sample applications available in this guide's GitHub repository\.  
[blank\-powershell](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-lambda-developer-guide/tree/master/sample-apps/blank-powershell) â€“ A PowerShell function that shows the use of logging, environment variables, and the AWS SDK\.

Before you get started, you must first set up a PowerShell development environment\. For instructions on how to do this, see [Setting Up a PowerShell Development Environment](powershell-devenv.md)\.

To learn about how to use the AWSLambdaPSCore module to download sample PowerShell projects from templates, create PowerShell deployment packages, and deploy PowerShell functions to the AWS Cloud, see [AWS Lambda deployment package in PowerShell](powershell-package.md)\.
