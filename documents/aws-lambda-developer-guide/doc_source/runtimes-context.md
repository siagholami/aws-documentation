# AWS Lambda execution context<a name="runtimes-context"></a>

When AWS Lambda executes your Lambda function, it provisions and manages the resources needed to run your Lambda function\. When you create a Lambda function, you specify configuration information, such as the amount of memory and maximum execution time that you want to allow for your Lambda function\. When a Lambda function is invoked, AWS Lambda launches an execution context based on the configuration settings you provide\. The execution context is a temporary runtime environment that initializes any external dependencies of your Lambda function code, such as database connections or HTTP endpoints\. This affords subsequent invocations better performance because there is no need to "cold\-start" or initialize those external dependencies, as explained below\.

It takes time to set up an execution context and do the necessary "bootstrapping", which adds some latency each time the Lambda function is invoked\. You typically see this latency when a Lambda function is invoked for the first time or after it has been updated because AWS Lambda tries to reuse the execution context for subsequent invocations of the Lambda function\.

After a Lambda function is executed, AWS Lambda maintains the execution context for some time in anticipation of another Lambda function invocation\. In effect, the service freezes the execution context after a Lambda function completes, and thaws the context for reuse, if AWS Lambda chooses to reuse the context when the Lambda function is invoked again\. This execution context reuse approach has the following implications: 
+ Objects declared outside of the function's handler method remain initialized, providing additional optimization when the function is invoked again\. For example, if your Lambda function establishes a database connection, instead of reestablishing the connection, the original connection is used in subsequent invocations\. We suggest adding logic in your code to check if a connection exists before creating one\.
+ Each execution context provides 512 MB of additional disk space in the `/tmp` directory\. The directory content remains when the execution context is frozen, providing transient cache that can be used for multiple invocations\. You can add extra code to check if the cache has the data that you stored\. For information on deployment limits, see [AWS Lambda quotas](gettingstarted-limits.md)\.
+ Background processes or callbacks initiated by your Lambda function that did not complete when the function ended resume if AWS Lambda chooses to reuse the execution context\. You should make sure any background processes or callbacks in your code are complete before the code exits\.

When you write your Lambda function code, do not assume that AWS Lambda automatically reuses the execution context for subsequent function invocations\. Other factors may dictate a need for AWS Lambda to create a new execution context, which can lead to unexpected results, such as database connection failures\.
