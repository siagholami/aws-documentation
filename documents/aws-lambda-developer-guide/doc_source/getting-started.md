# Getting started with AWS Lambda<a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with AWS Lambda, use the Lambda console to create a function\. In a few minutes, you can create a function, invoke it, and view logs, metrics, and trace data\. 

**Note**  
To use Lambda and other AWS services, you need an AWS account\. If you don't have an account, visit [aws\.amazon\.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choose **Create an AWS Account**\. For detailed instructions, see [Create and activate an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)\.  
As a best practice, you should also create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user with administrator permissions and use that for all work that does not require root credentials\. Create a password for console access, and access keys to use command line tools\. See [Creating your first IAM admin user and group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) in the *IAM User Guide* for instructions\.

You can author functions in the Lambda consoleâ€”or with an IDE toolkit, command line tools, or SDKs\. The Lambda console provides a [code editor](code-editor.md) for noncompiled languages that lets you modify and test code quickly\. The [AWS CLI](gettingstarted-awscli.md) gives you direct access to the Lambda API for advanced configuration and automation use cases\.
