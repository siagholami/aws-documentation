| [Concurrency metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-metrics.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | AWS Lambda now reports the `ConcurrentExecutions` metric for all functions, aliases, and versions\. You can view a graph for this metric on the monitoring page for your function\. Previously, `ConcurrentExecutions` was only reported at the account level and for functions that use reserved concurrency\. For details, see [AWS Lambda function metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-metrics.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | February 18, 2020 | 
| [Update to function states](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | Function states are now enforced for all functions by default\. When you connect a function to a VPC, Lambda creates shared elastic network interfaces\. This enables your function to scale up without creating additional network interfaces\. During this time, you can't perform additional operations on the function, including updating its configuration and publishing versions\. In some cases, invocation is also impacted\. Details about a function's current state are available from the Lambda API\.This update is being released in phases\. For details, see [Updated Lambda states lifecycle for VPC networking](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/coming-soon-updated-lambda-states-lifecycle-for-vpc-networking/) on the AWS Compute Blog\. For more information about states, see [AWS Lambda function states](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | January 24, 2020 | 
| [Updates to function configuration API output](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_FunctionConfiguration.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | Added reason codes to [StateReasonCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetFunctionConfiguration.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss#SSS-GetFunctionConfiguration-response-LastUpdateStatusReasonCode) \(InvalidSubnet, InvalidSecurityGroup\) and LastUpdateStatusReasonCode \(SubnetOutOfIPAddresses, InvalidSubnet, InvalidSecurityGroup\) for functions that connect to a VPC\. For more information about states, see [AWS Lambda function states](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | January 20, 2020 | 
| [Provisioned concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | You can now allocate provisioned concurrency for a function version or alias\. Provisioned concurrency enables a function to scale without fluctuations in latency\. For details, see [Managing concurrency for a Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | December 3, 2019 | 
| [Create a database proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-database.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | You can now use the Lambda console to create a database proxy for a Lambda function\. A database proxy enables a function to reach high concurrency levels without exhausting database connections\. For details, see [Configuring database access for a Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-database.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | December 3, 2019 | 
| [Percentiles support for the duration metric](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-metrics.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | You can now filter the duration metric based on percentiles\. For details, see [AWS Lambda metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-metrics.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\.  | November 26, 2019 |

When you increase the number of concurrent batches per shard, your function's concurrency can be up to 10 times the number of shards in your stream\. For details, see [AWS Lambda event source mapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-eventsourcemapping.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | November 25, 2019 | 
| [Function states](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | When you create or update a function, it enters a pending state while Lambda provisions resources to support it\. If you connect your function to a VPC, Lambda can create a shared elastic network interface right away, instead of creating network interfaces when your function is invoked\. This results in better performance for VPC\-connected functions, but might require an update to your automation\. For details, see [AWS Lambda function states](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | November 25, 2019 |

For details, see [Configuring error handling for asynchronous invocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss#invocation-async-errors)\. | November 25, 2019 | 
| [Error handling for stream event sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-eventsourcemapping.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | New configuration options are available for event source mappings that read from streams\. You can configure [DynamoDB stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-ddb.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) and [Kinesis stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-kinesis.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) event source mappings to limit retries and set a maximum record age\. When errors occur, you can configure the event source mapping to split batches before retrying, and to send invocation records for failed batches to a queue or topic\. For details, see [AWS Lambda event source mapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-eventsourcemapping.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | November 25, 2019 | 
| [Destinations for asynchronous invocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss#invocation-async-destinations) | You can now configure Lambda to send records of asynchronous invocations to another service\. Invocation records contain details about the event, context, and function response\. You can send invocation records to an SQS queue, SNS topic, Lambda function, or EventBridge event bus\. For details, see [Configuring destinations for asynchronous invocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss#invocation-async-destinations)\. | November 25, 2019 |

| [FIFO queue support for Amazon SQS event sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | You can now create an event source mapping that reads from a first\-in, first\-out \(FIFO\) queue\. Previously, only standard queues were supported\. For details, see [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | November 18, 2019 | 
| [Create applications in the Lambda console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/applications-tutorial.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | Application creation in the Lambda console is now generally available\. For instructions, see [Creating an application with continuous delivery in the Lambda console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/applications-tutorial.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | October 31, 2019 | 
| [Create applications in the Lambda console \(beta\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/applications-tutorial.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | You can now create a Lambda application with an integrated continuous delivery pipeline in the Lambda console\. The console provides sample applications that you can use as a starting point for your own project\. Choose between AWS CodeCommit and GitHub for source control\.

For instructions, see [Creating an application with continuous delivery in the Lambda console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/applications-tutorial.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | October 3, 2019 | 
| [Performance improvements for VPC\-connected functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | Lambda now uses a new type of elastic network interface that is shared by all functions in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) subnet\. When you connect a function to a VPC, Lambda creates a network interface for each combination of security group and subnet that you choose\. When the shared network interfaces are available, the function no longer needs to create additional network interfaces as it scales up\. This dramatically improves startup times\. For details, see [Configuring a Lambda function to access resources in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | September 3, 2019 | 
| [Stream batch settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-ddb.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | You can now configure a batch window for [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-ddb.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) and [Amazon Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-kinesis.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) event source mappings\. Configure a batch window of up to five minutes to buffer incoming records until a full batch is available\. This reduces the number of times that your function is invoked when the stream is less active\. | August 29, 2019 | 
| [CloudWatch Logs Insights integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions-access-metrics.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | The monitoring page in the Lambda console now includes reports from Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights\.

You can send requests to your Lambda function endpoint URL\. You can configure security on the endpoint to allow open access, leverage AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) to authorize access, or use API keys to meter access to your Lambda functions by others\.  For an example Getting Started exercise, see [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon API Gateway](services-apigateway.md)\.  For more information about the Amazon API Gateway, see [https://aws\.amazon\.com/api\-gateway/](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)\.   | July 09, 2015 |
