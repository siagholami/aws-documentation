Monitoring and troubleshooting Lambda applications
AWS Lambda automatically monitors Lambda functions on your behalf and reports metrics through Amazon CloudWatch. To help you monitor your code as it executes, Lambda automatically tracks the number of requests, the execution duration per request, and the number of requests that result in an error. It also publishes the associated CloudWatch metrics. You can leverage these metrics to set CloudWatch custom alarms.
The Lambda console provides a built-in monitoring dashboard for each of your functions and applications.
To monitor a function

Pricing
CloudWatch has a perpetual free tier. Beyond the free tier threshold, CloudWatch charges for metrics, dashboards, alarms, logs, and insights. For details, see CloudWatch pricing.
Each time your function is invoked, Lambda records metrics for the request, the function's response, and the overall state of the function. You can use metrics to set alarms the are triggered when function performance degrades, or when you are close to hitting concurrency limits in the current Region.
To debug and validate that your code is working as expected, you can output logs with the standard logging functionality for your programming language. The Lambda runtime uploads your function's log output to CloudWatch Logs. You can view logs in the CloudWatch Logs console, in the Lambda console, or from the command line.
In addition to monitoring logs and metrics in CloudWatch, you can use AWS X-Ray to trace and debug requests served by your application. For details, see Using AWS Lambda with AWS X-Ray.
