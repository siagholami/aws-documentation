Importing a VM as an Image Using VM Import/Export
You can use VM Import/Export to import virtual machine (VM) images from your virtualization environment to Amazon EC2 as Amazon Machine Images (AMI), which you can use to launch instances. Subsequently, you can export the VM images from an instance back to your virtualization environment. This enables you to leverage your investments in the VMs that you have built to meet your IT security, configuration management, and compliance requirements by bringing them into Amazon EC2.

Export Your VM from its Virtualization Environment
After you have prepared your VM for export, you can export it from your virtualization environment. When importing a VM as an image, you can import disks in the following formats: Open Virtualization Archive (OVA), Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK), Virtual Hard Disk (VHD/VHDX), and raw. With some virtualization environments, you would export to Open Virtualization Format (OVF), which typically includes one or more VMDK, VHD, or VHDX files, and then package the files into an OVA file.
For more information, see the documentation for your virtualization environment. For example:
 VMware — Search for "Export an OVF Template" on the VMware Docs site. Follow the instructions for creating an OVA.
 Citrix — About VM Import and Export on the Citrix website
 Microsoft Hyper-V — Overview of exporting and importing a virtual machine on the Microsoft website
 Microsoft Azure — Download a Windows VHD from Azure or Download a Linux VHD from Azure on the Microsoft website. From the Azure Portal, choose the VM to migrate, and then choose Disks. Select each disk (either OS or data) and choose Create Snapshot. On the completed snapshot resource, choose Export. This creates a URL that you can use to download the virtual image.
Import Your VM as an Image
After exporting your VM from your virtualization environment, you can import it to Amazon EC2. The import process is the same regardless of the origin of the VM.

 Prerequisites
 Upload the Image to Amazon S3
 Import the VM
Prerequisites

Create an Amazon S3 bucket for storing the exported images or choose an existing bucket. The bucket must be in the Region where you want to import your VMs. For more information about S3 buckets, see the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide.
Create an IAM role named vmimport. For more information, see Required Service Role.
If you have not already installed the AWS CLI on the computer you'll use to run the import commands, see the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

Upload the Image to Amazon S3
Upload your VM image file to your Amazon S3 bucket using the upload tool of your choice. For information about uploading objects through the Amazon S3 console, see Uploading Objects.
Import the VM
After you upload your VM image file to Amazon S3, you can use the AWS CLI to import the image. These tools accept either the Amazon S3 bucket and path to the file or a URL for a public Amazon S3 file. Private Amazon S3 files require a presigned URL.
The following examples use the AWS CLI command import-image to create import tasks.
Example 1: Import an OVA
Use the following command to import an image with a single disk.
aws ec2 import-image --description "My server VM" --disk-containers "file://C:\import\containers.json"
The following is an example containers.json file.
[
  {
    "Description": "My Server OVA",
    "Format": "ova",
    "UserBucket": {
        "S3Bucket": "my-import-bucket",
        "S3Key": "vms/my-server-vm.ova"
    }
}]
Example 2: Import Multiple Disks
Use the following command to import an image with multiple disks.
$ C:\> aws ec2 import-image --description "My server disks" --disk-containers "file://C:\import\containers.json"
The following is an example containers.json file.
[
  {
    "Description": "First disk",
    "Format": "vmdk",
    "UserBucket": {
        "S3Bucket": "my-import-bucket",
        "S3Key": "disks/my-server-vm-disk1.vmdk"
    }
  },          
  {
    "Description": "Second disk",
    "Format": "vmdk",
    "UserBucket": {
        "S3Bucket": "my-import-bucket",
        "S3Key": "disks/my-server-vm-disk2.vmdk"
    }
  }
]
Example 3: Import Disk with Encrypted Option Enabled
Use the following command to import an image with an encrypted root volume.
aws ec2 import-image --description "My server disks" --encrypted --kms-key-id 0ea3fef3-80a7-4778-9d8c-1c0c6EXAMPLE --disk-containers "file://C:\import\containers.json"
The CMK provided for encryption must not be disabled during the entire import process. For more information, see Amazon EBS Encryption in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.
Monitor an Import Image Task
Use the describe-import-image-tasks command to return the status of an import task.
aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks --import-task-ids import-ami-1234567890abcdef0
Status values include the following:
 active — The import task is in progress.
 deleting — The import task is being canceled.
 deleted — The import task is canceled.
 updating — Import status is updating.
 validating — The imported image is being validated.
 validated — The imported image was validated.
 converting — The imported image is being converted into an AMI.
 completed — The import task is completed and the AMI is ready to use.
After the import image task is completed, the output includes the ID of the AMI. The following is example output that includes ImageId.
{
    "ImportImageTasks": [
        {
            "ImportTaskId": "import-ami-01234567890abcdef",
            "ImageId": "ami-1234567890EXAMPLE",
            "SnapshotDetails": [
                {
                    "DiskImageSize": 705638400.0,
                    "Format": "ova",
                    "SnapshotId": "snap-111222333444aaabb"
                    "Status": "completed",
                    "UserBucket": {
                        "S3Bucket": "my-import-bucket",
                        "S3Key": "vms/my-server-vm.ova"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "Status": "completed"
        }
    ]
}
Cancel an Import Image Task
If you need to cancel an active import task, use the cancel-import-task command.
aws ec2 cancel-import-task --import-task-id import-ami-1234567890abcdef0
Next Steps
After the import image task is complete, you can launch an instance using the resulting AMI or copy the AMI to another Region.

For some operating systems, the device drivers for enhanced networking and NVMe block devices that are required by Nitro-based instances are not installed automatically during import. To install these drivers manually, use the directions in the following documentation. Next, create a new AMI from the customized instance.
