# Creating Flow Configurations \(Cloud\)<a name="iot-tg-sysdeploy-depconfig-cloud"></a>

A [flow configuration](iot-tg-models-tdm-iot-sdc-deployconfig.html) specifies all of the components and properties required to deploy a system in a physical location\. The flow configuration consists of an AWS IoT Things Graph Data Model \(TDM\) deployment definition\. The attributes in the definition specify other required resources, such as the IAM role that AWS IoT Things Graph assumes when it executes the flow in the cloud\.

This section describes the structure of a flow configuration and shows how to create one with the AWS IoT Things Graph console and the AWS CLI\.
