# Creating and Deploying Flows \(Cloud\)<a name="iot-tg-workflows-gs-cloud"></a>

After you model a flow and upload all of the entities that it contains, you create and deploy the flow\.

**Prerequisites**
+ An [AWS account](http://aws.amazon.com)
+ An IAM role that is configured according to the instructions in [Prepare for Cloud Deployments](iot-tg-gs-environment-cloud.html)
+ Completion of the steps in [Creating and Uploading Models](iot-tg-models-gs.html)

We provide procedures for creating and deploying flows using either the AWS CLI or the AWS IoT Things Graph console\. Both the AWS CLI and the console use the two devices that you created in [Creating and Uploading Models](iot-tg-models-gs.html)\.
