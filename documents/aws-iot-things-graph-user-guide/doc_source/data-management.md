AWS IoT Things Graph manages your account data in the following ways:
+ In AWS IoT Greengrass deployments, AWS IoT Things Graph modifies your AWS IoT Greengrass group\. For more information, see [Deploying and Running AWS IoT Things Graph on AWS IoT Greengrass](iot-tg-greengrass.html)\.
+ In cloud deployments, AWS IoT Things Graph uses an IAM role to allow AWS IoT Things Graph to execute the flows in the deployments on your behalf\. For more information, see [Prepare for Cloud Deployments](iot-tg-gs-environment-cloud.md)\.
