# Modeling by Device Communication Protocol<a name="iot-tg-protocols"></a>

AWS IoT Things Graph supports the MQTT and Modbus protocols for device communication in a flow\. The protocol that the device uses affects the way you define the device\. 

The topics in this section describe how you define devices and their interactions\. 

AWS IoT Things Graph supports the following protocols:
+ [MQTT](iot-tg-protocols-mqtt.html)
+ [Modbus](iot-tg-protocols-modbus.html)

For information about defining services that use HTTP \(REST\) and AWS Lambda functions, see [Service](iot-tg-models-tdm-iot-service.html) in the [AWS IoT Things Graph Data Model Reference](iot-tg-models.html)\.
