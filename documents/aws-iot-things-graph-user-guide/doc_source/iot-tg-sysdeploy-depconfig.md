# Creating Flow Configurations \(AWS IoT Greengrass\)<a name="iot-tg-sysdeploy-depconfig"></a>

A [flow configuration](iot-tg-models-tdm-iot-sdc-deployconfig.html) specifies all of the elements and properties required to deploy a system in a physical location\. The flow configuration consists of an AWS IoT Things Graph Data Model \(TDM\) deployment definition, with attributes that specify other required resources\. These include the name of the Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket from which the system is deployed, and the name of the AWS IoT Greengrass group to which the system is deployed\.

This section describes the structure of a flow configuration and shows how to create one with the AWS CLI and the AWS IoT Things Graph console\.
