AWS IoT Things Graph manages your account data in the following ways:
 In AWS IoT Greengrass deployments, AWS IoT Things Graph modifies your AWS IoT Greengrass group. For more information, see Deploying and Running AWS IoT Things Graph on AWS IoT Greengrass.
 In cloud deployments, AWS IoT Things Graph uses an IAM role to allow AWS IoT Things Graph to execute the flows in the deployments on your behalf. For more information, see Prepare for Cloud Deployments.
