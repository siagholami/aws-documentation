AWS IoT Things Graph Data Model Core Constructs
This part of the guide describes the core constructs, properties, and entities that the AWS IoT Things Graph Data Model (TDM) supports, and the GraphQL syntax for creating and editing them.
TDM has a set of built-in data types that support standard primitive data types, and the more complex data types that are specific to the IoT domain. TDM also uses a URN scheme for identifying all types in the system and organizing them into hierarchies.
