Amazon DynamoDB: Allows access to a specific table
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows full access to the MyTable DynamoDB table. This policy grants the permissions necessary to complete this action from the AWS API or AWS CLI only. To use this policy, replace the italicized placeholder text in the example policy with your own information. Then, follow the directions in create a policy or edit a policy.
Important
This policy allows all actions that can be performed on a DynamoDB table. To review these actions, see DynamoDB API Permissions: Actions, Resources, and Conditions Reference in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. You could provide the same permissions by listing each individual action. However, if you use the wildcard (*) in the Action element, such as "dynamodb:List*", then you don't have to update your policy if DynamoDB adds a new List action. 
This policy allows actions only on DynamoDB tables that exist with the specified name. To allow your users Read access to everything in DynamoDB, you can also attach the AmazonDynamoDBReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy.
