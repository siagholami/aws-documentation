Refining permissions in AWS using last accessed information
As an administrator, you might grant permissions to entities (users or roles) beyond what they require. IAM provides last accessed information to help you identify unused permissions so that you can remove them. You can use last accessed information to refine your policies and allow access to only the services and actions that your entities use. This helps you to better adhere to the best practice of least privilege. You can view last accessed information for entities or policies that exist in IAM or AWS Organizations.

Last accessed information types for IAM
You can view two types of last accessed information for IAM entities: allowed AWS service information and allowed action information. The information includes the date and time when the attempt was made. Action last accessed information is available for Amazon S3 management actions. Management actions include creation, deletion, and modification actions. To learn more about how to view last accessed information for IAM, see Viewing last accessed information for IAM.
For example scenarios for using last accessed information to make decisions about the permissions that you grant to your IAM entities, see Example scenarios for using last accessed information.
To learn more about how the information for management actions is provided, see Things to know about last accessed information.
Last accessed information for AWS Organizations
If you sign in using master account credentials, you can view service last accessed information for an AWS Organizations entity or policy in your organization. AWS Organizations entities include the organization root, organizational units (OUs), or accounts. Last accessed information for AWS Organizations includes information about services that are allowed by a service control policy (SCP). The information indicates which principals in an organization or account last attempted to access the service and when. To learn more about the report and how to view last accessed information for AWS Organizations, see Viewing last accessed information for Organizations.
For example scenarios for using last accessed information to make decisions about the permissions that you grant to your Organizations entities, see Example scenarios for using last accessed information.
Things to know about last accessed information
Before you use last accessed information from a report to change the permissions for an IAM entity or Organizations entity, review the following details about the information.
 Tracking period – Recent activity usually appears in the IAM console within four hours. The tracking period for service information is the last 400 days. The tracking period for actions information began on April, 12, 2020. For more information, see Where AWS tracks last accessed information.
 PassRole – The iam:PassRole action is not tracked and is not included in IAM service last accessed information.
 Action last accessed information – Action last accessed information is available for Amazon S3 management actions accessed by IAM entities. IAM provides action information for Amazon S3 management events that are logged by CloudTrail. Sometimes, CloudTrail management events are also called control plane operations or control plane events. Management events provide visibility into administrative operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account. To learn more about management events in CloudTrail, see Logging Management Events with Cloudtrail.
 Report owner – Only the principal that generates a report can view the report details. This means that when you view the information in the AWS Management Console, you might have to wait for it to generate and load. If you use the AWS CLI or AWS API to get report details, your credentials must match the credentials of the principal that generated the report. If you use temporary credentials for a role or federated user, you must generate and retrieve the report during the same session. For more information about assumed-role session principals, see AWS JSON policy elements: Principal.
 IAM entities – The information for IAM includes IAM entities (users or roles) in your account. Information for Organizations includes principals (IAM users, IAM roles, or the AWS account root user) in the specified Organizations entity. The information does not include unauthenticated attempts.
 IAM policy types – The information for IAM includes services that are allowed by an IAM entity's policies. These are policies attached to a role or attached to a user directly or through a group. Access allowed by other policy types is not included in your report. The excluded policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations SCPs, IAM permissions boundaries, and session policies. Permissions that are provided by service-linked roles are defined by the service that they are linked to and can't be modified in IAM. To learn more about service-linked roles, see Using service-linked roles To learn how the different policy types are evaluated to allow or deny access, see Policy evaluation logic.
 Organizations policy types – The information for AWS Organizations includes only services that are allowed by an Organizations entity's inherited service control policies (SCPs). SCPs are policies attached to a root, OU, or account. Access allowed by other policy types is not included in your report. The excluded policy types include identity-based policies, resource-based policies, access control lists, IAM permissions boundaries, and session policies. To learn how the different policy types are evaluated to allow or deny access, see Policy evaluation logic.
 Specifying a policy ID – When you use the AWS CLI or AWS API to generate a report for last accessed information in Organizations, you can optionally specify a policy ID. The resulting report includes information for the services that are allowed by only that policy. The information includes the most recent account activity in the specified Organizations entity or the entity's children. For more information, see aws iam generate-organizations-access-report or GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport.
 Organizations master account – You must sign in to your organization's master account to view service last accessed information. You can choose to view information for the master account using the IAM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API. The resulting report lists all AWS services, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID in the CLI or API, the policy is ignored. For each service, the report includes information for only the master account. However, reports for other Organizations entities do not return information for activity in the master account.
 Organizations settings – An administrator must enable SCPs in your organization root before you can generate data for Organizations.
Permissions required
To view the last accessed information in the AWS Management Console, you must have a policy that grants the necessary permissions.
Permissions for IAM information
To use the IAM console to view the last accessed information for an IAM user, role, or policy, you must have a policy that includes the following actions:
 iam:GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails
 iam:Get*
 iam:List*
These permissions allow a user to see the following:
 Which users, groups, or roles are attached to a managed policy
 Which services a user or role can access
 The last time they accessed the service
 The last time they attempted to use a specific S3 action
To use the AWS CLI or AWS API to view last accessed information for IAM, you must have permissions that match the operation you want to use:
 iam:GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails
 iam:GetServiceLastAccessedDetails
 iam:GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities
 iam:ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows viewing IAM last accessed information. Additionally, it allows read-only access to all of IAM. This policy also grants the necessary permissions to complete this action on the console. 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "iam:GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails",
            "iam:Get*",
            "iam:List*"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
    }
Permissions for AWS Organizations information
To use the IAM console to view a report for the root, OU, or account entities in Organizations, you must have a policy that includes the following actions:
 iam:GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport
 iam:GetOrganizationsAccessReport
 organizations:DescribeAccount
 organizations:DescribeOrganization
 organizations:DescribeOrganizationalUnit
 organizations:DescribePolicy
 organizations:ListChildren
 organizations:ListParents
 organizations:ListPoliciesForTarget
 organizations:ListRoots
 organizations:ListTargetsForPolicy
To use the AWS CLI or AWS API to view service last accessed information for Organizations, you must have a policy that includes the following actions:
 iam:GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport
 iam:GetOrganizationsAccessReport
 organizations:DescribePolicy
 organizations:ListChildren
 organizations:ListParents
 organizations:ListPoliciesForTarget
 organizations:ListRoots
 organizations:ListTargetsForPolicy
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows viewing service last accessed information for Organizations. Additionally, it allows read-only access to all of Organizations. This policy also grants the necessary permissions to complete this action on the console. 
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "iam:GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport",
            "iam:GetOrganizationsAccessReport",
            "organizations:Describe*",
            "organizations:List*"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
    }
}
You can also use the iam:OrganizationsPolicyId condition key to allow generating a report only for a specific Organizations policy. For an example policy, see IAM: View service last accessed information for an Organizations policy.
Troubleshooting activity for IAM and Organizations entities
In some cases, your AWS Management Console last accessed information table might be empty. Or perhaps your AWS CLI or AWS API request returns an empty set of information or a null field. In these cases, review the following issues:
 For action last accessed information, an action that you are expecting to see might not be returned in the list. This can happen either because the IAM entity does not have permissions for the action, or AWS does not yet track the action for last accessed information.
 For an IAM user, make sure that the user has at least one inline or managed policy attached, either directly or through group memberships.
 For an IAM group, verify that the group has at least one inline or managed policy attached.
 For an IAM group, the report returns only the service last accessed information for members that used the group's policies to access a service. To learn whether a member used other policies, review the last accessed information for that user.
 For an IAM role, verify that the role has at least one inline or managed policy attached.
 For an IAM entity (user or role), review other policy types that might affect the permissions of that entity. These include resource-based policies, access control lists, AWS Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, or session policies. For more information, see Policy types or Evaluating policies within a single account.
 For an IAM policy, make sure that the specified managed policy is attached to at least one user, group with members, or role.
 For an Organizations entity (root, OU, or account), make sure that you are signed using Organizations master account credentials.
 Verify that SCPs are enabled in your organization root.
 Action last accessed information is only available for some Amazon S3 actions.
When you make changes, wait at least four hours for activity to appear in your IAM console report. If you use the AWS CLI or AWS API, you must generate a new report to view the updated information.
Where AWS tracks last accessed information
AWS collects last accessed information for the standard AWS Regions. When AWS adds additional Regions, those Regions are added to the following table, including the date that AWS started tracking information in each Region.
 Service information – The tracking period for services is the last 400 days, or less if your Region began supporting this feature within the last year.
 Actions information – The tracking period for Amazon S3 management actions began on April, 12, 2020. If the Region tracking start date is after April 12, 2020, then that date is also the actions tracking start date for the Region.

If a Region is not listed in the previous table, then that Region does not yet provide last accessed information.
An AWS Region is a collection of AWS resources in a geographic area. Regions are grouped into partitions. The standard Regions are the Regions that belong to the aws partition. For more information about the different partitions, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) Format in the AWS General Reference. For more information about Regions, see About AWS Regions also in the AWS General Reference.
