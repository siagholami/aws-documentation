EC2: Start or stop instances based on tags
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows starting or stopping instances with the tag key–value pair Project = DataAnalytics, but only by principals with the tag key–value pair Department = Data. This policy grants the permissions necessary to complete this action from the AWS API or AWS CLI only. To use this policy, replace the italicized placeholder text in the example policy with your own information. Then, follow the directions in create a policy or edit a policy. 
The condition in the policy returns true if both parts of the condition are true. The instance must have the Project=DataAnalytics tag. In addition, the IAM principal (user or role) making the request must have the Department=Data tag. 
Note
As a best practice, attach policies with the aws:PrincipalTag condition key to IAM groups, for the case where some users might have the specified tag and some might not.
