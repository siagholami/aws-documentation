AWS services that work with IAM
The AWS services listed below are grouped by their AWS product categories and include information about what IAM features they support:
 Service – You can choose the name of a service to view the AWS documentation about IAM authorization and access for that service.
 Actions – You can specify individual actions in a policy. If the service does not support this feature, then All actions is selected in the visual editor. In a JSON policy document, you must use * in the Action element. For a list of actions in each service, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Services.
 Resource-level permissions – You can use ARNs to specify individual resources in the policy. If the service does not support this feature, then All resources is chosen in the policy visual editor. In a JSON policy document, you must use * in the Resource element. Some actions, such as List* actions, do not support specifying an ARN because they are designed to return multiple resources. If a service supports this feature for some resources but not others, it is indicated by yellow cells in the table. See the documentation for that service for more information.
 Resource-based policies – You can attach resource-based policies to a resource within the service. Resource-based policies include a Principal element to specify which IAM identities can access that resource. For more information, see Identity-based policies and resource-based policies.
 Authorization based on tags – You can use resource tags in the condition of a policy to control access to a resource in the service. You do this using the aws:ResourceTag global condition key or service-specific tags, such as https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ExamplePolicies_EC2.html#iam-example-taggingresources. For more information about defining permissions based on attributes such as tags, see What is ABAC for AWS?.
 Temporary credentials – Users signed in with federation, a cross-account role, or a service role can access the service. Temporary security credentials are obtained by calling AWS STS API operations like AssumeRole or GetFederationToken. For more information, see Temporary security credentials in IAM. 
 Service-linked roles – A service-linked role gives the service permission to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Choose the Yes link to see the documentation for services that support these roles. For more information, see Using service-linked roles.
 More information – If a service doesn't fully support a feature, you can review the footnotes for an entry to view the limitations and links to related information.

¹ CloudFront does not support action-level permissions for creating CloudFront key pairs. You must use an AWS account root user to create a CloudFront key pair. For more information, see Creating CloudFront Key Pairs for Your Trusted Signers in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. 
² In an IAM user policy, you cannot restrict permissions to a specific Amazon VPC endpoint. Any Action element that includes the ec2:*VpcEndpoint* or ec2:DescribePrefixLists API actions must specify ""Resource": "*"". For more information, see Controlling the Use of Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide. 
³ Amazon VPC supports attaching a single resource policy to a VPC endpoint to restrict what can be accessed through that endpoint. For more information about using resource-based policies to control access to resources from specific Amazon VPC endpoints, see Using Endpoint Policies in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
⁴ Amazon CloudFront doesn't have service-linked roles, but Lambda@Edge does. For more information, see Service-Linked Roles for Lambda@Edge in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.
