Getting Started with AWS IAM Access Analyzer
Use the information in this topic to learn about the requirements necessary to use and manage AWS IAM Access Analyzer, and then how to enable Access Analyzer. To learn more about the service-linked role for Access Analyzer, see Using Service-Linked Roles for AWS IAM Access Analyzer.
Permissions Required to Use Access Analyzer
To successfully configure and use Access Analyzer, the account you use must be granted the required permissions. To access and use all Access Analyzer features, you can apply the IAMAccessAnalyzerFullAccess managed policy to the account. The full access policy grants the following permissions:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "access-analyzer:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "iam:AWSServiceName": "access-analyzer.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "organizations:DescribeAccount",
        "organizations:DescribeOrganization",
        "organizations:DescribeOrganizationalUnit",
        "organizations:ListAccounts",
        "organizations:ListAccountsForParent",
        "organizations:ListAWSServiceAccessForOrganization",
        "organizations:ListChildren",
        "organizations:ListDelegatedAdministrators",
        "organizations:ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent",
        "organizations:ListParents",
        "organizations:ListRoots"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
A custom policy for managing Access Analyzer must include the following permissions:
 access-analyzer: *
 iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole
To allow read-only access to Access Analyzer, use the IAMAccessAnalyzerReadOnlyAccess managed policy. This policy grants the following permissions:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "access-analyzer:Get*",
        "access-analyzer:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
If you plan to use Access Analyzer for an organization in AWS Organizations, you need to enable trusted access for Access Analyzer in AWS Organizations. You also need the following permissions:
 organizations:DescribeAccount
 organizations:DescribeOrganization
 organizations:DescribeOrganizationalUnit
 organizations:ListAccounts
 organizations:ListAccountsForParent
 organizations:ListAWSServiceAccessForOrganization
 organizations:ListChildren
 organizations:ListDelegatedAdministrators
 organizations:ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent
 organizations:ListParents
 organizations:ListRoots
Resources Defined by AWS IAM Access Analyzer
Access Analyzer defines the following resources:



Resource
ARN




analyzer
arn:${Partition}:access-analyzer:${Region}:${Account}:analyzer/${analyzerName}


archive-rule
arn:${Partition}:access-analyzer:${Region}:${Account}:analyzer/${analyzerName}/archive-rule/${ruleName}



Required Access Analyzer Service Permissions
Access Analyzer uses a service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForAccessAnalyzer to grant the service read-only access to analyze AWS resources with resource-based policies on your behalf. When you create an analyzer with your account as the zone of trust, the service creates the role your account. When you create an analyzer with your organization as the zone of trust, the service creates a roll in each account that belongs to your organization. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for AWS IAM Access Analyzer.
Note
Access Analyzer is Regional. You must enable Access Analyzer in each Region independently.
In some cases, after you enable Access Analyzer, the Findings page loads with no findings. This might be due to a delay in the console for populating your findings. You need to manually refresh the browser to view your findings. If you still don't see any findings, it's because you have no supported resources in your account that can be accessed by an external entity. If a policy that grants access to an external entity is applied to a resource, Access Analyzer generates a finding.
Note
It may take up to 30 minutes after a policy is modified for Access Analyzer to analyze the resource and then either generate a new finding or update an existing finding for the access to the resource.
Enabling Access Analyzer
To enable Access Analyzer in a Region, you must create an analyzer in that Region. You must create an analyzer in each Region in which you want to monitor access to your resources.
To create an analyzer with the account as the zone of trust


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


Choose Access analyzer. 


Choose Create analyzer.


On the Create analyzer page, confirm that the Region displayed is the Region where you want to enable Access Analyzer.


Enter a name for the analyzer.


Choose the account as the zone of trust for the analyzer.
Note
If your account is not the AWS Organizations master account or delegated administrator account, you can create only one analzyer with your account as the zone of trust.


Optional. Add any tags that you want to apply to the analyzer.


Choose Create Analyzer.


When you create an analyzer to enable Access Analyzer, a service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForAccessAnalyzer is created in your account.
To create an analyzer with the organization as the zone of trust


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


Choose Access analyzer. 


Choose Create analyzer.


On the Create analyzer page, confirm that the Region displayed is the Region where you want to enable Access Analyzer.


Enter a name for the analyzer.


Choose your organization as the zone of trust for the analyzer.


Optional. Add any tags that you want to apply to the analyzer.

Access Analyzer Status
To view the status of your analyzers, choose Analyzers. Analyzers created for an organization or account can have the following status:



Status
Description




Active
The analyzer is actively monitoring resources within its zone of trust. The analyzer actively generates new findings and updates existing findings.


Creating
The creation of the analyzer is still in progress. The analyzer becomes active once creation is complete.
