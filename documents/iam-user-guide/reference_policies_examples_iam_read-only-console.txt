IAM: Allows read-only access to the IAM console
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows IAM users to perform any IAM action that begins with the string Get, List, or Generate. As users work with the IAM console, the console makes requests to list groups, users, roles, and policies, and to generate reports about those resources.
The asterisk acts as a wildcard. When you use iam:Get* in a policy, the resulting permissions include all IAM actions that begin with Get, such as GetUser and GetRole. Using a wildcard is beneficial, especially if new types of entities are added to IAM in the future. In that case, the permissions granted by the policy automatically allow the user to list and get the details about those new entities. 
Use this policy for console access or for reporting purposes.
