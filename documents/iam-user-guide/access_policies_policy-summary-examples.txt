Policy 5: Unrecognized_Service_Action
The following policy was intended to provide full access to DynamoDB, but that access fails because dynamodb is misspelled as dynamobd. This policy was intended to allow access to some Amazon EC2 actions in the us-east-2 Region, but deny that access to the ap-northeast-2 Region. However, access to reboot instances in the ap-northeast-2 Region is not explicitly denied because of the unrecognized o in the middle of the RebootInstances action. This example shows how you can use policy summaries to locate errors in your policies. To learn how to edit policies based on information in a policy summary, see Editing policies to fix warnings.
