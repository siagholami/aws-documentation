Using Service-Linked Roles for AWS IAM Access Analyzer
AWS IAM Access Analyzer uses an IAM  service-linked role. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Access Analyzer. Service-linked roles are predefined by Access Analyzer and include all the permissions that the feature requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.
A service-linked role makes setting up Access Analyzer easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions. Access Analyzer defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only Access Analyzer can assume its roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.
For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS Services That Work with IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column. Choose a Yes with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.
Service-Linked Role Permissions for AWS IAM Access Analyzer
AWS IAM Access Analyzer uses the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForAccessAnalyzer – Allow Access Analyzer to analyze resource metadata.
The AWSServiceRoleForAccessAnalyzer service-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:
 access-analyzer.amazonaws.com
The role permissions policy allows Access Analyzer to complete the following actions on the specified resources:

You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-Linked Role Permissions in the IAM User Guide.
Creating a Service-Linked Role for Access Analyzer
You don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you enable Access Analyzer in the AWS Management Console or the AWS API, Access Analyzer creates the service-linked role for you. The same service-linked role is used in all Regions in which you enable Access Analyzer.
Note
Access Analyzer is Regional. You must enable Access Analyzer in each Region independently.
If you delete this service-linked role, Access Analyzer recreates the role when you next create an analyzer.
You can also use the IAM console to create a service-linked role with the Access Analyzer use case. In the AWS CLI or the AWS API, create a service-linked role with the access-analyzer.amazonaws.com service name. For more information, see Creating a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide. If you delete this service-linked role, you can use this same process to create the role again.
Editing a Service-Linked Role for Access Analyzer
Access Analyzer does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForAccessAnalyzer service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
Deleting a Service-Linked Role for Access Analyzer
If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role. That way you don’t have an unused entity that isn't actively monitored or maintained. However, you must clean up the resources for your service-linked role before you can manually delete it.
Note
If Access Analyzer is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.
To delete Access Analyzer resources used by the AWSServiceRoleForAccessAnalyzer


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the Access reports section, under Access analyzer, choose Analyzers.


Choose the check box on the top left above the list of analyzers in the Analyzers table to select all analyzers.


Choose Delete.


To confirm that you want to delete the analyzers, enter delete, and then choose Delete.


To manually delete the service-linked role using IAM
Use the IAM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API to delete the AWSServiceRoleForAccessAnalyzer service-linked role. For more information, see Deleting a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.
Supported Regions for Access Analyzer Service-Linked Roles
Access Analyzer supports using service-linked roles in all of the Regions where the service is available. For more information, see AWS Regions and Endpoints.
