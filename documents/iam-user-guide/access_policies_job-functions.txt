AWS managed policies for job functions
AWS managed policies for job functions are designed to closely align to common job functions in the IT industry. You can use these policies to easily grant the permissions needed to carry out the tasks expected of someone in a specific job function. These policies consolidate permissions for many services into a single policy that's easier to work with than having permissions scattered across many policies.
You can attach these policies for job functions to any group, user, or role. 
Use Roles to Combine Services
Some of the policies use IAM service roles to help you take advantage of features found in other AWS services. These policies grant access to iam:passrole, which allows a user with the policy to pass a role to an AWS service. This role delegates IAM permissions to the AWS service to carry out actions on your behalf.
You must create the roles according to your needs. For example, the Network Administrator policy allows a user with the policy to pass a role named "flow-logs-vpc" to the Amazon CloudWatch service. CloudWatch uses that role to log and capture IP traffic for VPCs created by the user.
To follow security best practices, the policies for job functions include filters that limit the names of valid roles that can be passed. This helps avoid granting unnecessary permissions. If your users do require the optional service roles, you must create a role that follows the naming convention specified in the policy. You then grant permissions to the role. Once that is done, the user can configure the service to use the role, granting it whatever permissions the role provides.
Keep Up to Date
These policies are all maintained by AWS and are kept up to date to include support for new services and new capabilities as they are added by AWS. These policies cannot be modified by customers. You can make a copy of the policy and then modify the copy, but that copy is not automatically updated as AWS introduces new services and API operations.

Creating roles and attaching policies (console)
Several of the previously listed policies grant the ability to configure AWS services with roles that enable those services to perform operations on your behalf. The job function policies either specify exact role names that you must use or at least include a prefix that specifies the first part of the name that can be used. To create one of these roles, perform the steps in the following procedure.
To create a role for an AWS service (IAM console)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Roles, and then choose Create role.


Choose the AWS service role type, and then choose the service that you want to allow to assume this role.


Choose the use case for your service. If the specified service has only one use case, it is selected for you. Use cases are defined by the service to include the trust policy that the service requires. Then choose Next: Permissions.


If possible, select the policy to use for the permissions policy or choose Create policy to open a new browser tab and create a new policy from scratch. For more information, see step 4 in the procedure Creating IAM policies in the IAM User Guide. After you create the policy, close that tab and return to your original tab. Select the check box next to the permissions policies that you want the service to have.


Depending on the use case that you selected, the service might allow you to do any of the following:
    Nothing, because the service defines the permissions for the role
    Allow you to choose from a limited set of permissions
    Allow you to choose from any permissions
    Allow you to select no policies at this time, create the policies later, and then attach them to the role

(Optional) Set a permissions boundary. This is an advanced feature that is available for service roles, but not service-linked roles. 

Expand the Set permissions boundary section and choose Use a permissions boundary to control the maximum role permissions. IAM includes a list of the AWS managed and customer managed policies in your account. Select the policy to use for the permissions boundary or choose Create policy to open a new browser tab and create a new policy from scratch. For more information, see step 4 in the procedure Creating IAM policies in the IAM User Guide. After you create the policy, close that tab and return to your original tab to select the policy to use for the permissions boundary.


Choose Next: Tags.


(Optional) Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key-value pairs. For more information about using tags in IAM, see Tagging IAM Entities in the IAM User Guide.


Choose Next: Review.


For Role name, the degree of role name customization is defined by the service. If the service defines the role's name, this option is not editable. In other cases, the service might define a prefix for the role and allow you to enter an optional suffix. Some services allow you to specify the entire name of your role.


If possible, enter a role name or role name suffix to help you identify the purpose of this role. Role names must be unique within your AWS account. They are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create roles named both PRODROLE and prodrole. Because various entities might reference the role, you cannot edit the name of the role after it has been created.


(Optional) For Role description, enter a description for the new role.


Review the role and then choose Create role.


Example 1: Configuring a user as a database administrator (console)
This example shows the steps required to configure Alice, an IAM user, as a Database Administrator. You use the information in first row of the table in that section and allow the user to enable Amazon RDS monitoring. You attach the DatabaseAdministrator policy to Alice's IAM user so that she can manage the Amazon database services. That policy also enables Alice to pass a role called rds-monitoring-role to the Amazon RDS service that allows the service to monitor the RDS databases on her behalf.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


Choose Policies and then type database in the search box.


Select the check box for the DatabaseAdministrator policy, choose Policy actions, and then choose Attach.


In the list of users, select Alice and then choose Attach policy. Alice now can administer AWS databases. However, to allow Alice to monitor those databases, you must configure the service role.


In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Roles, and then choose Create role.


Choose the AWS Service role type, and then choose Amazon RDS.


Choose the Amazon RDS Role for Enhanced Monitoring use case.


Amazon RDS defines the permissions for your role. Choose Next: Review to continue.


The role name must be one of those specified by the DatabaseAdministrator policy that Alice now has. One of those is rds-monitoring-role. Type that for the Role name.


(Optional) For Role description, type a description for the new role.


After you review the details, choose Create role.


Alice can now enable RDS Enhanced Monitoring in the Monitoring section of the Amazon RDS console. For example, she might do this when she creates a DB instance, creates a read replica, or modifies a DB instance. She must type the role name she created (rds-monitoring-role) in the Monitoring Role box when she sets Enable Enhanced Monitoring to Yes. 


Example 2: Configuring a user as a network administrator (console)
This example shows the steps required to configure Juan, an IAM user, as a Network Administrator. It uses the information in the table in that section to allow Juan to monitor IP traffic going to and from a VPC. It also allows Juan to capture that information in the logs in CloudWatch Logs. You attach the NetworkAdministrator policy to Juan's IAM user so that he can configure AWS network resources. That policy also enables Juan to pass a role whose name begins with flow-logs* to Amazon EC2 when you create a flow log. In this scenario, unlike Example 1, there isn't a predefined service role type, so you must perform a few steps differently.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Policies and then type network in the search box.


Select the check box next to NetworkAdministrator policy, choose Policy actions, and then choose Attach.


In the list of users, select the check box next to Juan and then choose Attach policy. Juan now can administer AWS network resources. However, to enable monitoring of IP traffic in your VPC, you must configure the service role.


Because the service role you need to create doesn't have a predefined managed policy, you must first create it. In the navigation pane, choose Policies, then choose Create policy.


Choose the JSON tab and copy the text from the following JSON policy document. Paste this text into the JSON text box. 


{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Action": [
           "logs:CreateLogGroup",
           "logs:CreateLogStream",
           "logs:PutLogEvents",
           "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
           "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }


When you are finished, choose Review policy. The Policy Validator reports any syntax errors.
Note
You can switch between the Visual editor and JSON tabs any time. However, if you make changes or choose Review policy in the Visual editor tab, IAM might restructure your policy to optimize it for the visual editor. For more information, see Policy restructuring.


On the Review page, type vpc-flow-logs-policy-for-service-role for the policy name. Review the policy Summary to see the permissions granted by your policy, and then choose Create policy to save your work.


The new policy appears in the list of managed policies and is ready to attach.


In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Roles, and then choose Create role.


Choose the AWS Service role type, and then choose Amazon EC2.


Choose the Amazon EC2 use case.


On the Attach permissions policies page, choose the policy you created earlier, vpc-flow-logs-policy-for-service-role, and then choose Next: Review.


The role name must be permitted by the NetworkAdministrator policy that Juan now has. Any name that begins with flow-logs- is allowed. For this example, type flow-logs-for-juan for the Role name.


(Optional) For Role description, type a description for the new role.


After you review the details, choose Create role.


Now you can configure the trust policy required for this scenario. On the Roles page, choose the flow-logs-for-juan role (the name, not the check box). On the details page for your new role, choose the Trust relationships tab, and then choose Edit trust relationship.


Change the "Service" line to read as follows, replacing the entry for ec2.amazonaws.com:


"Service": "vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com"

Juan can now create flow logs for a VPC or subnet in the Amazon EC2 console. When you create the flow log, specify the flow-logs-for-juan role. That role has the permissions to create the log and write data to it.
