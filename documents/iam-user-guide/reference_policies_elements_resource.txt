IAM JSON policy elements: Resource
The Resource element specifies the object or objects that the statement covers. Statements must include either a Resource or a NotResource element. You specify a resource using an ARN. For more information about the format of ARNs, see IAM ARNs.
Each service has its own set of resources. Although you always use an ARN to specify a resource, the details of the ARN for a resource depend on the service and the resource. For information about how to specify a resource, refer to the documentation for the service whose resources you're writing a statement for.
Note
Some services do not let you specify actions for individual resources; instead, any actions that you list in the Action or NotAction element apply to all resources in that service. In these cases, you use the wildcard * in the Resource element. 
The following example refers to a specific Amazon SQS queue.
"Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:account-ID-without-hyphens:queue1"
The following example refers to the IAM user named Bob in an AWS account.
"Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account-ID-without-hyphens:user/Bob"
You can use wildcards as part of the resource ARN. You can use wildcard characters (* and ?) within any ARN segment (the parts separated by colons). An asterisk (*) represents any combination of characters and a question mark (?) represents any single character. You can use multiple * or ? characters in each segment, but a wildcard cannot span segments. The following example refers to all IAM users whose path is /accounting. 
"Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account-ID-without-hyphens:user/accounting/*"
The following example refers to all items within a specific Amazon S3 bucket.
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my_corporate_bucket/*"
You can specify multiple resources. The following example refers to two DynamoDB tables.
"Resource": [
    "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:account-ID-without-hyphens:table/books_table",
    "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:account-ID-without-hyphens:table/magazines_table"
]
In the Resource element, you can use JSON policy variables in the part of the ARN that identifies the specific resource (that is, in the trailing part of the ARN). For example, you can use the key {aws:username} as part of a resource ARN to indicate that the current user's name should be included as part of the resource's name. The following example shows how you can use the {aws:username} key in a Resource element. The policy allows access to a Amazon DynamoDB table that matches the current user's name.
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "dynamodb:*",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:table/${aws:username}"
  }
}
