Document history for IAM
The following table describes major documentation updates for IAM.



Change
Description
Date




IAM users longer role session duration
IAM users can now have a longer role session duration when switching roles in the AWS Management Console, reducing interruptions due to session expiration. Users are granted the maximum session duration set for the role, or the remaining time in the IAM user's session, whichever is less.
July 24, 2020


Use Service Quotas to request quick increases for IAM entities
You can request quota increases for adjustable IAM quotas using the Service Quotas console. Now, some increases are automatically approved in Service Quotas and available in your account within a few minutes. Larger requests are submitted to AWS Support.
June 25, 2020


Last accessed information in IAM now includes Amazon S3 management actions
In addition to service last accessed information, you can now view information in the IAM console about the last time an IAM principal used an Amazon S3 action. You can also use the AWS CLI or AWS API to retrieve the data report. The report includes information about the allowed services and actions that principals last attempted to access and when. You can use this information to identify unnecessary permissions so that you can refine your IAM policies to better adhere to the principle of least privilege.
June 3, 2020


Security chapter addition
The security chapter helps you understand how to configure IAM and AWS STS to meet your security and compliance objectives. You also learn how to use other AWS services that help you to monitor and secure your IAM resources.
April 29, 2020


sts:RoleSessionName
You can now write a policy that grants permissions based on the session name that a principal specifies when assuming a role.
April 21, 2020


AWS sign-in page update
When you sign in on the main AWS sign-in page, you can no choose to sign in as the AWS account root user or an IAM user. When you do, the label on the page indicates whether you should provide your root user email address or your IAM user account information. This documentation includes updated screen captures to help you understand the AWS sign-in pages.
March 4, 2020


aws:ViaAWSService and aws:CalledVia condition keys
You can now write a policy to limit whether services can make requests on behalf of an IAM principal (user or role). When a principal makes a request to an AWS service, that service might use the principal's credentials to make subsequent requests to other services. Use the aws:ViaAWSService condition key to match if any service makes a request using a principal's credentials. Use the aws:CalledVia condition keys to match if specific services make a request using a principal's credentials.
February 20, 2020


Policy simulator adds support for permissions boundaries
You can now test the effect of permissions boundaries on IAM entities with the IAM policy simulator.
January 23, 2020


Cross-account policy evaluation
You can now learn how AWS evaluates policies for cross-account access. This occurs when a resource in a trusting account includes a resource-based policy that allows a principal in another account to access the resource. The request must be allowed in both accounts.
January 2, 2020


Session tags
You can now include tags when you assume a role or federate a user in AWS STS. When you perform the AssumeRole or GetFederationToken operation, you can pass the session tags as attributes. When you perform the AssumeRoleWithSAML or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity operations, you can pass attributes from your corporate identities to AWS.
November 22, 2019


Control access for groups of AWS accounts in AWS Organizations
You can now reference organizational units (OUs) from AWS Organizations in IAM policies. If you use Organizations to organize your accounts into OUs, you can require that principals belong to a specific OU before granting access to your resources. Principals include AWS account root user, IAM users and IAM roles. To do this, specify the OU path in the aws:PrincipalOrgPaths condition key in your policies.
November 20, 2019


Role last used
You can now view the date, time, and Region where a role was last used. This information also helps you identify unused roles in your account. You can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI and AWS API to view information about when a role was last used.
November 19, 2019


Update to the global condition context keys page
You can now learn when each of the global condition keys is included in the context of a request. You can also navigate to each key more easily using the page table of contents (TOC). The information on the page helps you to write more accurate policies. For example, if your employees use federation with IAM roles, you should use the aws:userId key and not the aws:userName key. The aws:userName key applies only to IAM users and not roles.
October 6, 2019


ABAC in AWS
Learn how attribute-based access control (ABAC) works in AWS using tags, and how it compares to the traditional AWS authorization model. Use the ABAC tutorial to learn how to create and test a policy that allows IAM roles with principal tags to access resources with matching tags. This strategy allows individuals to view or edit only the AWS resources required for their jobs.
October 3, 2019


AWS STS GetAccessKeyInfo operation
You can review the AWS access keys in your code to determine whether the keys are from an account that you own. You can pass an access key ID using the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-access-key-info.html AWS CLI command or the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetAccessKeyInfo.html AWS API operation.
July 24, 2019


Viewing Organizations service last accessed information in IAM
You can now view service last accessed information for an AWS Organizations entity or policy in the AWS Organizations section of the IAM console. You can also use the AWS CLI or AWS API to retrieve the data report. This data includes information about the allowed services that principals in an Organizations account last attempted to access and when. You can use this information to identify unnecessary permissions so that you can refine your Organizations policies to better adhere to the principle of least privilege.
June 20, 2019


Using a managed policy as a session policy
You can now pass up to 10 managed policy ARNs when you assume a role. This allows you to limit the permissions of the role's temporary credentials.
May 7, 2019


AWS STS Region compatibility of session tokens for the global endpoint
You can now choose whether to use version 1 or version 2 global endpoint tokens. Version 1 tokens are valid only in AWS Regions that are available by default. These tokens will not work in manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong). Version 2 tokens are valid in all Regions. However, version 2 tokens are longer and might affect systems where you temporarily store tokens.
April 26, 2019


Allow enabling and disabling AWS regions
You can now create a policy that allows an administrator to enable and disable the Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) Region (ap-east-1).
April 24, 2019


IAM user my security credentials page
IAM users can now manage all of their own credentials on the My Security Credentials page. This AWS Management Console page displays account information such as the account ID and canonical user ID. Users can also view and edit their own passwords, access keys, X.509 certificates, SSH keys, and Git credentials.
January 24, 2019


Access advisor API
You can now use the AWS CLI and AWS API to view service last accessed information.
December 7, 2018


Tagging IAM users and roles
You can now use IAM tags to add custom attributes to an identity (IAM user or role) using a tag key-value pair. You can also use tags to control an identity's access to resources or to control what tags can be attached to an identity.
November 14, 2018


U2F security keys
You can now use U2F security keys as a multi-factor authentication (MFA) option when signing in to the AWS Management Console.
September 25, 2018


Support for Amazon VPC endpoints
You can now establish a private connection between your VPC and AWS STS in the US West (Oregon) Region.
