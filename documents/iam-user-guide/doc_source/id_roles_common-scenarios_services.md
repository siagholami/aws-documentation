# Providing access to an AWS service<a name="id_roles_common-scenarios_services"></a>

Many AWS services require that you use roles to control what that service can access\. A role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf is called a [service role](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-role)\. When a role serves a specialized purpose for a service, it can be categorized as a [service role for EC2 instances](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-role-ec2), or a [service\-linked role](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-linked-role)\. See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) for each service to see if it uses roles and to learn how to assign a role for the service to use\.

For details about creating a role to delegate access to a service offered by AWS, see [Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](id_roles_create_for-service.md)\.
