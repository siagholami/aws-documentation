# AWS services that work with IAM<a name="reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam"></a>

The AWS services listed below are grouped by their [AWS product categories](https://aws.amazon.com/products/) and include information about what IAM features they support:
+ **Service** – You can choose the name of a service to view the AWS documentation about IAM authorization and access for that service\.
+ **Actions** – You can specify individual actions in a policy\. If the service does not support this feature, then **All actions** is selected in the [visual editor](access_policies_create-console.md#access_policies_create-visual-editor)\. In a JSON policy document, you must use `*` in the `Action` element\. For a list of actions in each service, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Services](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html)\.
+ **Resource\-level permissions** – You can use [ARNs](reference_identifiers.md#identifiers-arns) to specify individual resources in the policy\. If the service does not support this feature, then **All resources** is chosen in the [policy visual editor](access_policies_create-console.md#access_policies_create-visual-editor)\. In a JSON policy document, you must use `*` in the `Resource` element\. Some actions, such as `List*` actions, do not support specifying an ARN because they are designed to return multiple resources\. If a service supports this feature for some resources but not others, it is indicated by yellow cells in the table\. See the documentation for that service for more information\.
+ **Resource\-based policies** – You can attach resource\-based policies to a resource within the service\. Resource\-based policies include a `Principal` element to specify which IAM identities can access that resource\. For more information, see [Identity\-based policies and resource\-based policies](access_policies_identity-vs-resource.md)\.
+ **Authorization based on tags** – You can use [resource tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html) in the condition of a policy to control access to a resource in the service\. You do this using the [`aws:ResourceTag`](reference_policies_condition-keys.md#condition-keys-resourcetag) global condition key or service\-specific tags, such as [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ExamplePolicies_EC2.html#iam-example-taggingresources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ExamplePolicies_EC2.html#iam-example-taggingresources)\. For more information about defining permissions based on attributes such as tags, see [What is ABAC for AWS?](introduction_attribute-based-access-control.md)\.
+ **Temporary credentials** – Users signed in with federation, a cross\-account role, or a [service role](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-role) can access the service\. Temporary security credentials are obtained by calling AWS STS API operations like [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) or [GetFederationToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetFederationToken.html)\. For more information, see [Temporary security credentials in IAM](id_credentials_temp.md)\. 
+ **Service\-linked roles** – A [service\-linked role](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-linked-role) gives the service permission to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf\. Choose the `Yes` link to see the documentation for services that support these roles\. For more information, see [Using service\-linked roles](using-service-linked-roles.md)\.
+ **More information** – If a service doesn't fully support a feature, you can review the footnotes for an entry to view the limitations and links to related information\.

¹ Amazon EC2 service\-linked roles cannot be created using the AWS Management Console, and can be used only for the following features: [Scheduled Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-scheduled-instances.html#service-linked-roles-scheduled-instances), [Spot Instance Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html#service-linked-roles-spot-instance-requests), [Spot Fleet Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html#service-linked-roles-spot-fleet-requests)\.

² Only some Amazon ECS actions [support resource\-level permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-supported-iam-actions-resources.html)\.

³ AWS Lambda doesn't have service\-linked roles, but Lambda@Edge does\. For more information, see [Service\-Linked Roles for Lambda@Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-edge-permissions.html#using-service-linked-roles) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide\.

¹ IAM supports only one type of resource\-based policy called a role *trust policy*, which is attached to an IAM role\. For more information, see [Granting a user permissions to switch roles](id_roles_use_permissions-to-switch.md)\.

² IAM supports tag\-based access control for only user and role resources\.

³ Only some of the API actions for IAM can be called with temporary credentials\. For more information, see [Comparing your API options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)\.

⁴ AWS STS does not have "resources," but does allow restricting access in a similar way to users\. For more information, see [Denying Access to Temporary Security Credentials by Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_disable-perms.html#denying-access-to-credentials-by-name)\.

⁵ Only some of the API operations for AWS STS support calling with temporary credentials\. For more information, see [Comparing your API options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html)\.

¹ CloudFront does not support action\-level permissions for creating CloudFront key pairs\. You must use an AWS account root user to create a CloudFront key pair\. For more information, see [Creating CloudFront Key Pairs for Your Trusted Signers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html#private-content-creating-cloudfront-key-pairs) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*\. 

² In an IAM user policy, you cannot restrict permissions to a specific Amazon VPC endpoint\. Any `Action` element that includes the `ec2:*VpcEndpoint*` or `ec2:DescribePrefixLists` API actions must specify "`"Resource": "*"`"\. For more information, see [Controlling the Use of Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html#vpc-endpoints-iam-access) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. 

³ Amazon VPC supports attaching a single resource policy to a VPC endpoint to restrict what can be accessed through that endpoint\. For more information about using resource\-based policies to control access to resources from specific Amazon VPC endpoints, see [Using Endpoint Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html#vpc-endpoint-policies) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

⁴ Amazon CloudFront doesn't have service\-linked roles, but Lambda@Edge does\. For more information, see [Service\-Linked Roles for Lambda@Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-edge-permissions.html#using-service-linked-roles) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide\.
