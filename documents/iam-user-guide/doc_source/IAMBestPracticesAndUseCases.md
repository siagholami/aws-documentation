# Security best practices and use cases in AWS Identity and Access Management<a name="IAMBestPracticesAndUseCases"></a>

AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) provides a number of security features to consider as you develop and implement your own security policies\. The following best practices are general guidelines and don't represent a complete security solution\. Because these best practices might not be appropriate or sufficient for your environment, treat them as helpful considerations rather than prescriptions\.

To get the greatest benefits from IAM, take time to learn the recommended best practices\. One way to do this is to see how IAM is used in real\-world scenarios to work with other AWS services\.
