# Document history for IAM<a name="document-history"></a>

The following table describes major documentation updates for IAM\.

| Change | Description | Date | 
| --- |--- |--- |
| [IAM users longer role session duration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use) | IAM users can now have a longer role session duration when switching roles in the AWS Management Console, reducing interruptions due to session expiration\. Users are granted the maximum session duration set for the role, or the remaining time in the IAM user's session, whichever is less\. | July 24, 2020 | 
| [Use Service Quotas to request quick increases for IAM entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entities) | You can request quota increases for adjustable IAM quotas using the Service Quotas console\.

| [Last accessed information in IAM now includes Amazon S3 management actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html) | In addition to service last accessed information, you can now view information in the IAM console about the last time an IAM principal used an Amazon S3 action\. You can also use the AWS CLI or AWS API to retrieve the data report\. The report includes information about the allowed services and actions that principals last attempted to access and when\. You can use this information to identify unnecessary permissions so that you can refine your IAM policies to better adhere to the principle of least privilege\. | June 3, 2020 | 
| [Security chapter addition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security.html) | The security chapter helps you understand how to configure IAM and AWS STS to meet your security and compliance objectives\.

| [sts:RoleSessionName](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_iam-condition-keys.html#ck_rolesessionname) | You can now write a policy that grants permissions based on the session name that a principal specifies when assuming a role\. | April 21, 2020 | 
| [AWS sign\-in page update](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console.html) | When you sign in on the main AWS sign\-in page, you can no choose to sign in as the AWS account root user or an IAM user\. When you do, the label on the page indicates whether you should provide your root user email address or your IAM user account information\. This documentation includes updated screen captures to help you understand the AWS sign\-in pages\. | March 4, 2020 | 
| [aws:ViaAWSService and aws:CalledVia condition keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) | You can now write a policy to limit whether services can make requests on behalf of an IAM principal \(user or role\)\. When a principal makes a request to an AWS service, that service might use the principal's credentials to make subsequent requests to other services\. Use the `aws:ViaAWSService` condition key to match if any service makes a request using a principal's credentials\. Use the `aws:CalledVia` condition keys to match if specific services make a request using a principal's credentials\. | February 20, 2020 | 
| [Policy simulator adds support for permissions boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html) | You can now test the effect of permissions boundaries on IAM entities with the IAM policy simulator\. | January 23, 2020 | 
| [Cross\-account policy evaluation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic-cross-account.html) | You can now learn how AWS evaluates policies for cross\-account access\. This occurs when a resource in a trusting account includes a resource\-based policy that allows a principal in another account to access the resource\. The request must be allowed in both accounts\. | January 2, 2020 | 
| [Session tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html) | You can now include tags when you assume a role or federate a user in AWS STS\.

| [Control access for groups of AWS accounts in AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-principal-org-paths) | You can now reference organizational units \(OUs\) from AWS Organizations in IAM policies\. If you use Organizations to organize your accounts into OUs, you can require that principals belong to a specific OU before granting access to your resources\. Principals include AWS account root user, IAM users and IAM roles\. To do this, specify the OU path in the `aws:PrincipalOrgPaths` condition key in your policies\. | November 20, 2019 | 
| [Role last used](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage_delete.html) | You can now view the date, time, and Region where a role was last used\.

You can also navigate to each key more easily using the page table of contents \(TOC\)\. The information on the page helps you to write more accurate policies\. For example, if your employees use federation with IAM roles, you should use the `aws:userId` key and not the `aws:userName` key\. The `aws:userName` key applies only to IAM users and not roles\. | October 6, 2019 | 
| [ABAC in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html) | Learn how attribute\-based access control \(ABAC\) works in AWS using tags, and how it compares to the traditional AWS authorization model\. Use the ABAC tutorial to learn how to create and test a policy that allows IAM roles with principal tags to access resources with matching tags\. This strategy allows individuals to view or edit only the AWS resources required for their jobs\. | October 3, 2019 | 
| [AWS STS GetAccessKeyInfo operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_access-keys-audit) | You can review the AWS access keys in your code to determine whether the keys are from an account that you own\. You can pass an access key ID using the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-access-key-info.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-access-key-info.html) AWS CLI command or the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetAccessKeyInfo.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetAccessKeyInfo.html) AWS API operation\. | July 24, 2019 |

You can also use the AWS CLI or AWS API to retrieve the data report\. This data includes information about the allowed services that principals in an Organizations account last attempted to access and when\. You can use this information to identify unnecessary permissions so that you can refine your Organizations policies to better adhere to the principle of least privilege\. | June 20, 2019 | 
| [Using a managed policy as a session policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html) | You can now pass up to 10 managed policy ARNs when you assume a role\. This allows you to limit the permissions of the role's temporary credentials\. | May 7, 2019 | 
| [AWS STS Region compatibility of session tokens for the global endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html) | You can now choose whether to use version 1 or version 2 global endpoint tokens\. Version 1 tokens are valid only in AWS Regions that are available by default\. These tokens will not work in manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific \(Hong Kong\)\. Version 2 tokens are valid in all Regions\. However, version 2 tokens are longer and might affect systems where you temporarily store tokens\. | April 26, 2019 |
