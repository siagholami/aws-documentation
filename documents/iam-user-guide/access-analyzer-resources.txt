Supported Resource Types
Access Analyzer analyzes the resource-based policies that are applied to AWS resources in the Region where you enabled Access Analyzer. Only resource-based policies are analyzed. Review the information about each resource for details about how Access Analyzer generates findings for each resource type.

Amazon Simple Storage Service Buckets
When Access Analyzer analyzes Amazon S3 buckets, it generates a finding when an Amazon S3 bucket policy, ACL, or access point applied to a bucket grants access to an external entity. An external entity is a principal or other entity that you can use to create a filter that isn't within your zone of trust. For example, if a bucket policy grants access to another account or allows public access, Access Analyzer generates a finding. However, if you enable Block public access on your bucket, you can block access at the account level or the bucket level.
Amazon S3 block public access settings override the bucket policies that are applied to the bucket. The settings also override the access point policies applied to the bucketâ€™s access points. Access Analyzer analyzes block public access settings at the bucket level whenever a policy changes. However, it evaluates the block public access settings at the account level only once every 6 hours. This means that Access Analyzer might not generate or resolve a finding for public access to a bucket for up to 6 hours. For example, if you have a bucket policy that allows public access, Access Analyzer generates a finding for that access. If you then enable block public access to block all public access to the bucket at the account level, Access Analyzer doesn't resolve the finding for the bucket policy for up to 6 hours, even though all public access to the bucket is blocked.
AWS Identity and Access Management Roles
For IAM roles, Access Analyzer analyzes trust policies. In a role trust policy, you define the principals that you trust to assume the role. A role trust policy is a required resource-based policy that is attached to a role in IAM. Access Analyzer generates findings for roles within the zone of trust that can be accessed by an external entity that is outside your zone of trust.
Note
An IAM role is a global resource. If a role trust policy grants access to an external entity, Access Analyzer generates a finding in each enabled Region.
AWS Key Management Service Keys
For AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs), Access Analyzer analyzes the key policies and grants applied to a key. Access Analyzer generates a finding if a key policy or grant allows an external entity to access the key. For example, if you use the kms:CallerAccount condition key in a policy statement to allow access to all users in a specific AWS account, and you specify an account other than the current account (the zone of trust for the current analyzer), Access Analyzer generates a finding. To learn more about KMS condition keys in IAM policy statements, see AWS KMS Condition Keys.
When Access Analyzer analyzes a KMS key it reads key metadata, such as the key policy and list of grants. If the key policy doesn't allow the Access Analyzer role to read the key metadata, an Access Denied error finding is generated. For example, if the following example policy statement is the only policy applied to a key, it results in an Access Denied error finding in Access Analyzer:
{
    "Sid": "Allow access for Key Administrators",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
       "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin"
    },
    "Action": "kms:*",
    "Resource": "*"
}
Because this statement allows only the role named Admin from the AWS account 111122223333 to access the key, an Access Denied error finding is generated because Access Analyzer isn't able to fully analyze the key. An error finding is displayed in red text in the Findings table. The finding looks similar to the following:
{
    "error": "ACCESS_DENIED",
    "id": "12345678-1234-abcd-dcba-111122223333",
    "analyzedAt": "2019-09-16T14:24:33.352Z",
    "resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:1234567890:key/1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8a",
    "resourceType": "AWS::KMS::Key",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "updatedAt": "2019-09-16T14:24:33.352Z"
}
When you create a KMS CMK, the permissions granted to access the key depend on how you create the key. If you receive an Access Denied error finding for a key resource, apply the following policy statement to the key resource to grant Access Analyzer permission to access the key.
{
    "Sid": "Allow Access Analyzer access to key metadata",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
        },
    "Action": [
        "kms:DescribeKey",
        "kms:GetKeyPolicy",
        "kms:List*"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
},
After you receive an Access Denied finding for a KMS key resource, and then resolve the finding by updating the key policy, the finding is updated to a status of Resolved. If there are policy statements or key grants that grant permission to the key to an external entity, you might see additional findings for the key resource. 
AWS Lambda Functions and Layers
For AWS Lambda functions, Access Analyzer analyzes policies, including condition statements in a policy, that grant access to the function to an external entity. Access Analyzer also analyzes permissions granted when using the AddPermission operation of the AWS Lambda API with an EventSourceToken.
Amazon Simple Queue Service Queues
For Amazon SQS queues, Access Analyzer analyzes policies, including condition statements in a policy, that allow an external entity access to a queue.
