Managing passwords for IAM users
IAM users who use the AWS Management Console to work with AWS resources must have a password in order to sign in. You can create, change, or delete a password for an IAM user in your AWS account. 
After you have assigned a password to a user, the user can sign in to the AWS Management Console using the sign-in URL for your account, which looks like this: 
https://12-digit-AWS-account-ID or alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
For more information about how IAM users sign in to the AWS Management Console, see Signing in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user or root user. 
In addition to manually creating individual passwords for your IAM users, you can create a password policy that applies to all IAM user passwords in your AWS account.
You can use a password policy to do these things:
 Set a minimum password length.
 Require specific character types, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters. Be sure to remind your users that passwords are case sensitive.
 Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords.
Note
When you allow your IAM users to change their own passwords, IAM automatically allows them to view the password policy. IAM users need permission to view the account's password policy in order to create a password that complies with the policy.
 Require IAM users to change their password after a specified period of time (enable password expiration).
 Prevent IAM users from reusing previous passwords.
 Force IAM users to contact an account administrator when the user has allowed his or her password to expire.
For information about managing your account's password policy, see Setting an account password policy for IAM users.
Even if your users have their own passwords, they still need permissions to access your AWS resources. By default, a user has no permissions. To give your users the permissions they need, you assign policies to them or to the groups they belong to. For information about creating users and groups, see IAM Identities (users, groups, and roles). For information about using policies to set permissions, see Changing permissions for an IAM user. 
You can grant users permission to change their own passwords. For more information, see Permitting IAM users to change their own passwords. For information about how users access your account sign-in page, see Signing in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user or root user.

You can use the AWS Management Console to manage passwords for your IAM users.
When users leave your organization or no longer need AWS access, it is important to find the credentials that they were using and ensure that they are no longer operational. Ideally, you delete credentials if they are no longer needed. You can always recreate them at a later date if the need arises. At the very least, you should change the credentials so that the former users no longer have access.
To add a password for an IAM user (console)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Users.


Choose the name of the user whose password you want to create. 


Choose the Security credentials tab, and then under Sign-in credentials, choose Manage password next to Console password.


In Manage console access, for Console access choose Enable if not already selected. If console access is disabled, then no password is needed.


For Set password, choose whether to have IAM generate a password or create a custom password: 
    To have IAM generate a password, choose Autogenerated password.
    To create a custom password, choose Custom password, and type the password. 
Note
The password that you create must meet the account's password policy, if one is currently set.


To require the user to create a new password when signing in, choose Require password reset. Then choose Apply.
Important
If you select the Require password reset option, make sure that the user has permission to change his or her password. For more information, see Permitting IAM users to change their own passwords.


If you choose the option to generate a password, choose Show in the New password dialog box. This lets you view the password so you can share it with the user. 
Important
For security reasons, you cannot access the password after completing this step, but you can create a new password at any time.

To delete (disable) an IAM user's password (console)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Users.


Choose the name of the user whose password you want to delete. 


Choose the Security credentials tab, and then under Sign-in credentials, choose Manage password next to Console password.


For Console access, choose Disable, and then choose Apply.


Important
When you delete a user's password, the user can no longer sign in to the AWS Management Console. If the user has active access keys, they continue to function and allow access through the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, or AWS API function calls.
Creating, changing, or deleting an IAM user password (AWS CLI)
You can use the AWS CLI API to manage passwords for your IAM users.
To create a password (AWS CLI)


(Optional) To determine whether a user has a password, run this command: aws iam get-login-profile


To create a password, run this command: aws iam create-login-profile


To change a user's password (AWS CLI)


(Optional) To determine whether a user has a password, run this command: aws iam get-login-profile


To change a password, run this command: aws iam update-login-profile


To delete (disable) a user's password (AWS CLI)


(Optional) To determine whether a user has a password, run this command: aws iam get-login-profile


(Optional) To determine when a password was last used, run this command: aws iam get-user


To delete a password, run this command: aws iam delete-login-profile


Important
When you delete a user's password, the user can no longer sign in to the AWS Management Console. If the user has active access keys, they continue to function and allow access through the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, or AWS API function calls. When you use the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, or AWS API to delete a user from your AWS account, you must first delete the password using this operation. For more information, see Deleting an IAM user (AWS CLI).
