Creating IAM policies (AWS API)
A policy is an entity that, when attached to an identity or resource, defines their permissions. You can use the AWS API to create customer managed policies in IAM. Customer managed policies are standalone policies that you administer in your own AWS account. You can then attach the policies to identities (users, groups, and roles) in your AWS account.
The number and size of IAM resources in an AWS account are limited. For more information, see IAM and STS quotas.
