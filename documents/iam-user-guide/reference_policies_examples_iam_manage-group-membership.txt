IAM: Allows managing a group's membership programmatically and in the console
This example shows how you might create a policy that allows updating the membership of the group called MarketingTeam. This policy also grants the necessary permissions to complete this action on the console. To use this policy, replace the italicized placeholder text in the example policy with your own information. Then, follow the directions in create a policy or edit a policy.
What does this policy do?
 The ViewGroups statement allows allows the user to list all the users and groups in the AWS Management Console. It also allows the user to view basic information about the users in the account. These permissions must be in their own statement because they do not support or do not need to specify a resource ARN. Instead the permissions specify "Resource" : "*".
 The ViewEditThisGroup statement allows the user to view information about the MarketingTeam group, and to add and remove users from that group.
This policy does not allow the user to view or edit the permissions of the users or the MarketingTeam group.
