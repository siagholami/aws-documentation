Actions defined by AWS Key Management Service
You can specify the following actions in the Action element of an IAM policy statement. Use policies to grant permissions to perform an operation in AWS. When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API operation or CLI command with the same name. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to more than one operation. Alternatively, some operations require several different actions.
The Resource types column indicates whether each action supports resource-level permissions. If there is no value for this column, you must specify all resources ("*") in the Resource element of your policy statement. If the column includes a resource type, then you can specify an ARN of that type in a statement with that action. Required resources are indicated in the table with an asterisk (*). If you specify a resource-level permission ARN in a statement using this action, then it must be of this type. Some actions support multiple resource types. If the resource type is optional (not indicated as required), then you can choose to use one but not the other.
For details about the columns in the following table, see The actions table.

Resource types defined by AWS Key Management Service
The following resource types are defined by this service and can be used in the Resource element of IAM permission policy statements. Each action in the Actions table identifies the resource types that can be specified with that action. A resource type can also define which condition keys you can include in a policy. These keys are displayed in the last column of the table. For details about the columns in the following table, see The resource types table.

Condition keys for AWS Key Management Service
AWS Key Management Service defines the following condition keys that can be used in the Condition element of an IAM policy. You can use these keys to further refine the conditions under which the policy statement applies. For details about the columns in the following table, see The condition keys table.
To view the global condition keys that are available to all services, see Available global condition keys.




Condition keys
Description
Type




 kms:BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck 
Controls access to the CreateKey and PutKeyPolicy operations based on the value of the BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck parameter in the request.
Bool


 kms:CallerAccount 
Controls access to specified AWS KMS operations based on the AWS account ID of the caller. You can use this condition key to allow or deny access to all IAM users and roles in an AWS account in a single policy statement.
String


 kms:CustomerMasterKeySpec 
Controls access to an API operation based on the CustomerMasterKeySpec property of the CMK that is created by or used in the operation. Use it to qualify authorization of the CreateKey operation or any operation that is authorized for a CMK resource.
String


 kms:CustomerMasterKeyUsage 
Controls access to an API operation based on the KeyUsage property of the CMK created by or used in the operation. Use it to qualify authorization of the CreateKey operation or any operation that is authorized for a CMK resource.
String


 kms:DataKeyPairSpec 
Controls access to GenerateDataKeyPair and GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operations based on the value of the DataKeyPairSpec parameter in the request.
String


 kms:EncryptionAlgorithm 
Controls access to encryption operations based on the value of the encryption algorithm in the request.
String


 kms:EncryptionContextKeys 
Controls access based on the presence of specified keys in the encryption context. The encryption context is an optional element in a cryptographic operation.
String


 kms:ExpirationModel 
Controls access to the ImportKeyMaterial operation based on the value of the ExpirationModel parameter in the request.
String


 kms:GrantConstraintType 
Controls access to the CreateGrant operation based on the grant constraint in the request.
String


 kms:GrantIsForAWSResource 
Controls access to the CreateGrant operation when the request comes from a specified AWS service.
Bool


 kms:GrantOperations 
Controls access to the CreateGrant operation based on the operations in the grant.
String


 kms:GranteePrincipal 
Controls access to the CreateGrant operation based on the grantee principal in the grant.
String


 kms:KeyOrigin 
Controls access to an API operation based on the Origin property of the CMK created by or used in the operation. Use it to qualify authorization of the CreateKey operation or any operation that is authorized for a CMK resource.
String


 kms:MessageType 
Controls access to the Sign and Verify operations based on the value of the MessageType parameter in the request.
String


 kms:ReEncryptOnSameKey 
Controls access to the ReEncrypt operation when it uses the same customer master key that was used for the Encrypt operation.
Bool


 kms:RetiringPrincipal 
Controls access to the CreateGrant operation based on the retiring principal in the grant.
String


 kms:SigningAlgorithm 
Controls access to the Sign and Verify operations based on the signing algorithm in the request.
String


 kms:ValidTo 
Controls access to the ImportKeyMaterial operation based on the value of the ValidTo parameter in the request. You can use this condition key to allow users to import key material only when it expires by the specified date.
Numeric


 kms:ViaService 
Controls access when a request made on the principal's behalf comes from a specified AWS service.
String


 kms:WrappingAlgorithm 
Controls access to the GetParametersForImport operation based on the value of the WrappingAlgorithm parameter in the request.
String


 kms:WrappingKeySpec 
Controls access to the GetParametersForImport operation based on the value of the WrappingKeySpec parameter in the request.
String
