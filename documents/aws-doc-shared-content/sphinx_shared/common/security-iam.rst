|IAMlong| (|IAM|) is an |AWSlong| (|AWS|) service that helps an administrator securely control access to |AWS| resources. 
|IAM| administrators control who can be *authenticated* (signed in) and *authorized* (have permissions) to use resources 
|AWS| services. |IAM| is an |AWS| service that you can use with no additional charge.

To use |SERVICENAME| to access |AWS|, you need an |AWS| account and |AWS| credentials. To increase the security of your 
|AWS| account, we recommend that you use an *IAM user* to provide access credentials instead of using your |AWS| 
account credentials.

For details about working with |IAM|, see |IAM|_.

For an overview of |IAM| users and why they are important for the security of your account, 
see `AWS Security Credentials <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html>`_ 
in the |AWS-gr|_.
