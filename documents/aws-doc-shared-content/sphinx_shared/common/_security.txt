Cloud security at |AWSlong| (|AWS|) is the highest priority. As an |AWS| 
customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the 
requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. Security is a shared responsibility 
between |AWS| and you. The `Shared Responsibility Model <https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/>`_ 
describes this as Security of the Cloud and Security in the Cloud.

**Security of the Cloud** |ndash| AWS is responsible for 
protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the |AWS| Cloud and 
providing you with services that you can use securely. Our security responsibility is the 
highest priority at |AWS|, and the effectiveness of our security is regularly tested and 
verified by third-party auditors as part of the `AWS Compliance Programs <https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/>`_.

**Security in the Cloud** |ndash| Your responsibility is 
determined by the |AWS| service you are using, and other factors including the sensitivity of 
your data, your organizationâ€™s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.
