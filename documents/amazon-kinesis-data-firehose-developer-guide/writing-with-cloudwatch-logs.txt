For information about how to create a CloudWatch Logs subscription that sends log events to Kinesis Data Firehose, see Subscription Filters with Amazon Kinesis Firehose. 
Important
CloudWatch log events are compressed with gzip level 6. If you want to specify Amazon ES or Splunk as the destination for the delivery stream, use a Lambda function to uncompress the records to UTF-8.and single-line JSON. For information about using Lambda functions with a delivery stream, see Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Data Transformation.
