Sending Data to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream
You can send data to your Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery stream using different types of sources: You can use a Kinesis data stream, the Kinesis Agent, or the Kinesis Data Firehose API using the AWS SDK. You can also use Amazon CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Events, or AWS IoT as your data source. If you are new to Kinesis Data Firehose, take some time to become familiar with the concepts and terminology presented in What Is Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose?.
Note
Some AWS services can only send messages and events to a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that is in the same Region. If your delivery stream doesn't appear as an option when you're configuring a target for Amazon CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Events, or AWS IoT, verify that your Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream is in the same Region as your other services.
