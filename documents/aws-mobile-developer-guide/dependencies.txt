# Dependencies for the AWS Mobile SDK Developer Guide, which are copied into the build directory
# during a build.
#
# The format of this file is simple: each line represents a single dependency, consisting of a Git
# URL and an optional sub-directory within the repository. If the sub-directory is given, then
# everything within it and down is copied.
# when testing, you can add line starting with dir to copy a local copy of
# dependencies. Hereâ€™s an example:
# dir <path-to-local-dir>
#
# Git URL                                                      Subdirectory to copy
