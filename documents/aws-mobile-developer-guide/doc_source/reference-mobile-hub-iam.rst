   * - **Looking for the AWS SDKs for iOS and Android?** These SDKs and their docs are now part of `AWS Amplify <https://amzn.to/am-amplify-docs>`__.

       The content on this page applies only to apps that were configured using AWS Mobile Hub or awsmobile CLI. For existing apps that use AWS Mobile SDK prior to v2.8.0, we highly recommend you migrate your app to use `AWS Amplify <https://amzn.to/am-amplify-docs>`__ and the latest SDK.
