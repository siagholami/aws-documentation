Overview
=========

.. container:: option

   Android - Java
      .. _android-java:

      Enable your app to store and retrieve user files from cloud storage with the permissions model that suits your purpose. The CLI deploys and configures cloud storage buckets using `Amazon Simple Storage Service <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/>`__ (|S3|).

   Android - Kotlin
      .. _android-kotlin:

      Enable your app to store and retrieve user files from cloud storage with the permissions model that suits your purpose. The CLI deploys and configures cloud storage buckets using `Amazon Simple Storage Service <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/>`__ (|S3|).

   iOS - Swift
      .. _ios-swift:

      Enable your app to store and retrieve user files from cloud storage with the permissions model that suits your purpose. The CLI deploys and configures cloud storage buckets using `Amazon Simple Storage Service <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/>`__ (|S3|).

Storage Access
--------------

The CLI configures three different access levels on the storage bucket; public, protected and private.

- Files with public access level can be accessed by all users who are using your app. In S3, they are stored under the ``public/`` path in your S3 bucket.

- Files with protected access level are readable by all users but writable only by the creating user. In S3, they are stored under ``protected/{user_identity_id}/`` where the user_identity_id corresponds to a unique Amazon Cognito Identity ID for that user.

- Files with private access level are only accessible for specific authenticated users only. In S3, they are stored under ``private/{user_identity_id}/`` where the user_identity_id corresponds to a unique Amazon Cognito Identity ID for that user.

Set Up Your Backend
===================


#. Complete the :ref:`Get Started <add-aws-mobile-sdk>` steps before you proceed.

#. Use the CLI to add storage to your cloud-enabled backend and app.

      .. container:: option

         Android - Java
             In a terminal window, navigate to your project folder (the folder that typically contains your project level build.gradle), and add the SDK to your app.

            .. code-block:: none

                $ cd ./YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
                $ amplify add storage

#.  Choose Content as your storage service.

     .. code-block:: none

        ‚ùØ Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)

#. The CLI walks you though the options to enable Auth (if not enabled previously), to name your S3 bucket, and to decide who should have access (select ``Auth and guest users`` and ``read/write`` for both auth and guest users).

#. Confirm that you have storage and auth set up.

   .. code-block:: none

      $ amplify status
      | Category  | Resource name   | Operation | Provider plugin   |

Connect to Your Backend
=======================

Use the following steps to connect add file storage backend services to your app.

.. container:: option

   Android - Java
      Set up AWS Mobile SDK components as follows.

         #. Add the following to :file:`app/build.gradle` (Module:app):

            .. code-block:: json

               dependencies {
                  implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-s3:2.7.+'
                  implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:2.7.+@aar') { transitive = true }
                  implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-auth-userpools:2.7.+@aar') { transitive = true }
               }

            Perform a `Gradle Sync` to download the AWS Mobile SDK components into your app.

         #. Add the following to :file:`AndroidManifest.xml`:

	    .. code-block:: xml

               <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

               <service android:name="com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.s3.transferutility.TransferService" android:enabled="true" />

   Android - Kotlin
      Set up AWS Mobile SDK components as follows.

         #. Add the following to :file:`app/build.gradle`:

            .. code-block:: none

               dependencies {
                  implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-s3:2.7.+'
                  implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:2.7.+@aar') { transitive = true }
                  implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-auth-userpools:2.7.+@aar') { transitive = true }
               }

            Perform a `Gradle Sync` to download the AWS Mobile SDK components into your app

         #. Add the following to :file:`AndroidManifest.xml`:

	    .. code-block:: xml

               <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

            .. code-block:: xml

                  <service android:name="com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.s3.transferutility.TransferService" android:enabled="true" />

   iOS - Swift
      Set up AWS Mobile SDK components as follows.

         #. Add the following to :file:`Podfile` that you configure to install the AWS Mobile SDK:

            .. code-block:: none

               platform :ios, '9.0'

                  target :'YOUR-APP-NAME' do
                     use_frameworks!

                     pod 'AWSS3', '~> 2.6.13'   # For file transfers
                     pod 'AWSMobileClient', '~> 2.6.13'
                     pod 'AWSUserPoolsSignIn', '~> 2.6.13'

                     # other pods . . .

                  end

            Run :code:`pod install --repo-update` before you continue.

            If you encounter an error message that begins ":code:`[!] Failed to connect to GitHub to update the CocoaPods/Specs . . .`", and your internet connectivity is working, you might need to `update openssl and Ruby <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38993527/cocoapods-failed-to-connect-to-github-to-update-the-cocoapods-specs-specs-repo/48962041#48962041>`__.

         #. Add the following import to the classes that perform user file storage operations:

            .. code-block:: swift

               import AWSS3


.. _add-aws-user-data-storage-upload:

Upload a File
=============

.. container:: option

   Android - Java
    To upload a file to an Amazon S3 bucket, use :code:`AWSMobileClient` to get the :code:`AWSConfiguration` and :code:`AWSCredentialsProvider`,
    and then create the :code:`TransferUtility` object. :code:`AWSMobileClient` expects an activity context for resuming an authenticated session and creating the credentials provider.

    The following example shows how to use the :code:`TransferUtility` in the context of an Activity.
    If you are creating :code:`TransferUtility` from an application context, you can construct the :code:`AWSCredentialsProvider` and pass it into :code:`TransferUtility` to use in forming the :code:`AWSConfiguration` object. :code:`TransferUtility` checks the size of the file being uploaded and automatically switches over to using multi-part uploads if the file size exceeds 5 MB.

   Android - Kotlin
    To download a file from an Amazon S3 bucket, use :code:`AWSMobileClient`
    to get the :code:`AWSConfiguration` and  :code:`AWSCredentialsProvider` to create the :code:`TransferUtility` object.
    :code:`AWSMobileClient` expects an activity context for resuming an authenticated session and creating the :code:`AWSCredentialsProvider`.

    The following example shows how to use the :code:`TransferUtility` in the context of an Activity.
    If you are creating :code:`TransferUtility` from an application context, you can construct the :code:`AWSCredentialsProvider` and
    pass it into :code:`TransferUtility` to use in forming the :code:`AWSConfiguration` object.

   iOS - Swift

       .. code-block:: swift

          func downloadData() {

             //Create an expression object for progress tracking, to pass in request headers etc.
             let expression = AWSS3TransferUtilityDownloadExpression()
             expression.progressBlock = {(task, progress) in
                  // Do something e.g. Update a progress bar.
             }

	     //Create a completion handler to be called when the transfer completes
             var completionHandler: AWSS3TransferUtilityDownloadCompletionHandlerBlock?
             completionHandler = { (task, URL, data, error) -> Void in
                  // Do something e.g. Alert a user for transfer completion.
                  // On failed downloads, `error` contains the error object.
             }


             //Instantiate the transferUtility object. This will pickup the bucketName, region, and auth configuration
             //from the awsconfiguration.json file
             let transferUtility = AWSS3TransferUtility.default()

             //Download the data. Pass in the expression to get progress updates and completion handler to get notified
             //when the transfer is completed.
             let task = transferUtility.downloadData(
                   fromKey: "public/YourFileName",
                   expression: expression,

Next Steps
==========

* For sample apps that demonstrate TransferUtility capabilities, see `Android S3 TransferUtility Sample <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-android-samples/tree/master/S3TransferUtilitySample>`__ and `iOS S3 TransferUtility Sample <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-ios-samples/tree/master/S3TransferUtility-Sample>`__.

* Looking for Amazon Cognito Sync? If you are a new user, use `AWS AppSync <https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/>`__ instead. AppSync is a new service for synchronizing application data across devices. Like Cognito Sync, AppSync enables synchronization of a user's own data, such as game state or app preferences. AppSync extends these capabilities by allowing multiple users to synchronize and collaborate in real time on shared data, such as a virtual meeting space or chat room. `Start building with AWS AppSync now <https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/>`__
