What is AWS Health?
AWS Health provides ongoing visibility into your resource performance and the availability of your AWS services and accounts. You can use AWS Health events to learn how service and resource changes might affect your applications running on AWS. AWS Health provides relevant and timely information to help you manage events in progress. AWS Health also helps you be aware of and to prepare for planned activities. The service delivers alerts and notifications triggered by changes in the health of AWS resources, so that you get near-instant event visibility and guidance to help accelerate troubleshooting.
All customers can use the Personal Health Dashboard (PHD), powered by the AWS Health API. The dashboard requires no setup, and it's ready to use for authenticated AWS users. For more service highlights, see the AWS Personal Health Dashboard detail page .
Additionally, AWS Support customers who have a Business or Enterprise support plan can use the AWS Health API to integrate with in-house and third-party systems.
