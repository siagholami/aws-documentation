# Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a>

You can monitor Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics applications using Amazon CloudWatch\. CloudWatch collects and processes raw data from Kinesis Data Analytics into readable, near real\-time metrics\. These statistics are retained for a period of two weeks\. You can access the historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing\. By default, Kinesis Data Analytics metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch\. For more information, see [What Is Amazon CloudWatch?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
