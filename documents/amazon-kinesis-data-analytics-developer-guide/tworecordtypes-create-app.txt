Step 2: Create the Application
In this section, you create an Amazon Kinesis data analytics application. You then update the application by adding input configuration that maps the streaming source you created in the preceding section to an in-application input stream. 


Open the Kinesis Data Analytics console at  https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics.


Choose Create application. This example uses the application name ProcessMultipleRecordTypes.


On the application details page, choose Connect streaming data to connect to the source. 


On the Connect to source page, do the following:


Choose the stream that you created in Step 1: Prepare the Data. 


Choose to create an IAM role.


Wait for the console to show the inferred schema and samples records that are used to infer the schema for the in-application stream created.


Choose Save and continue.


On the application hub, choose Go to SQL editor. To start the application, choose Yes, start application in the dialog box that appears.


In the SQL editor, write the application code and verify the results:


Copy the following application code and paste it into the editor.
```
  --Create Order_Stream.
  CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "Order_Stream" 
             ( 
              "order_id"     integer, 
              "order_type"   varchar(10),
              "ticker"       varchar(4),
              "order_price"  DOUBLE, 
              "record_type"  varchar(10)
              );
CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "Order_Pump" AS 
     INSERT INTO "Order_Stream"
        SELECT STREAM "Oid", "Otype","Oticker", "Oprice", "RecordType" 
        FROM   "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001"
        WHERE  "RecordType" = 'Order';
  --********
  --Create Trade_Stream.    
  CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "Trade_Stream" 
             ("trade_id"     integer, 
              "order_id"     integer, 
              "trade_price"  DOUBLE, 
              "ticker"       varchar(4),
              "record_type"  varchar(10)
              );
CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "Trade_Pump" AS 
     INSERT INTO "Trade_Stream"
        SELECT STREAM "Tid", "Toid", "Tprice", "Tticker", "RecordType"
        FROM   "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001"
        WHERE  "RecordType" = 'Trade';
  --***********
  --do some analytics on the Trade_Stream and Order_Stream. 
  CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM" (
              "ticker"  varchar(4),
              "trade_count"   integer
              );
CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "Output_Pump" AS 
     INSERT INTO "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM"
        SELECT STREAM "ticker", count(*) as trade_count
        FROM   "Trade_Stream"
        GROUP BY "ticker",
                  FLOOR("Trade_Stream".ROWTIME TO MINUTE);
  ```


Choose Save and run SQL. Choose the Real-time analytics tab to see all of the in-application streams that the application created and verify the data. 


Next Step
You can configure application output to persist results to an external destination, such as another Kinesis stream or a Kinesis Data Firehose data delivery stream.
