Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch
You can monitor Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics applications using Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch collects and processes raw data from Kinesis Data Analytics into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are retained for a period of two weeks. You can access the historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing. By default, Kinesis Data Analytics metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch. For more information, see What Is Amazon CloudWatch? in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
