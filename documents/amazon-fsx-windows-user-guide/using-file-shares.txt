Using Microsoft Windows File Shares
A Microsoft Windows file share is a specific folder in your file system, including that folder's subfolders, which you make accessible to your compute instances with the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Your file system comes with a default Windows file share, named share. You can create and manage as many other Windows file shares as you want by using the Windows graphical user interface (GUI) tool called Shared Folders.
Accessing File Shares
To access your file shares, you use the Windows Map Network Drive functionality to map a drive letter on your compute instance to your Amazon FSx file share. The process of mapping a file share to a drive on your compute instance is known as mounting a file share in Linux. This process differs depending on the type of compute instance and the operating system. After your file share is mapped, your applications and users can access files and folders on your file share as if they are local files and folders.
Following, you can find procedures for mapping a file share on the different supported compute instances.

You can retrieve the file system's preferred file server IP address as follows:
   Using the Amazon FSx management console, in the Network & security tab of the File system details page
   In the response of the describe-file-systems CLI command or the equivalent DescribeFileSystems API command.
To Mount a File Share on an Amazon EC2 Linux Instance Not Joined to Your Active Directory
The following procedure mounts an Amazon FSx file share to an Amazon EC2 Linux instance that is not joined to your active directory (AD). For an EC2 Linux instance that is not joined to your Active Directory, you can only mount an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file share by using it's private IP address. You can get the file system's private IP address in the Amazon FSx console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/), in the Network & security tab, the Preferred File Server IP Address.
This example uses NTLM authentication. To do this, you mount the file system as a user that is a member of the Microsoft Active Directory domain that the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system is joined to. The credentials for the user account are provided in a text file that you create on your EC2 instance, creds.txt. This file contains the user name, password, and domain for the user.
$ cat creds.txt
username=user1
password=Password123
domain=EXAMPLE.COM

 cache=none – Sets the CIFS cache mode to none, that is not to cache file data at all.
Automatically Mount File Shares on an Amazon Linux EC2 Instance Not Joined to Your Active Directory
To automatically mount your Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file share whenever the Amazon EC2 Linux instance to which it's mounted reboots, you add an entry to the /etc/fstab file on the EC2 instance. The /etc/fstab file contains information about file systems. The command mount -a, which runs during instance startup, mounts the file systems listed in the /etc/fstab file. For an Amazon Linux EC2 instance that is not joined to your Active Directory, you can only mount an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file share by using it's private IP address. You can get the file system's private IP address in the Amazon FSx console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/), in the Network & security tab, the Preferred File Server IP Address.
The following procedure use Microsoft NTLM authentication. You mount the file system as a user that is a member of the Microsoft Active Directory domain to which the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system is joined. The credentials for the user account are provided in the text file creds.txt. This file contains the user name, password, and domain for the user.
$ cat creds.txt
username=user1
password=Password123

$ sudo yum install cifs-utils

Create the /mnt/fsx directory. This is where you will mount the Amazon FSx file system.

$ sudo mkdir /mnt/fsx


Create the creds.txt credentials file in the /home/ec2-user directory.


Set the file permissions so that only you (the owner) can read the file by running the following command.


$ sudo chmod 700 creds.txt
To automatically mount the file system


You automatically mount a file share not joined to your Active Directory by using its private IP address. You can get the file system's private IP address from the Amazon FSx console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/), in the Network & security tab, the Preferred File Server IP Address.


To automatically mount the file share using its private IP address, add the following line to the /etc/fstab file.


//file-system-IP-address/file_share /mnt/fsx cifs vers=3.0,sec=ntlmsspi,cred=/home/ec2-user/creds.txt,rsize=CIFSMaxBufSize,wsize=CIFSMaxBufSize,cache=none
Replace CIFSMaxBufSize with the largest value allowed by your kernel. Run the following command to get this value.
$ modinfo cifs | grep CIFSMaxBufSize
   parm:           CIFSMaxBufSize:Network buffer size (not including header). Default: 16384 Range: 8192 to 130048 (uint)
The output shows the maximum buffer size is 130048.

Test the fstab entry by using the mount command with the 'fake' option in conjunction with the 'all' and 'verbose' options.

$ sudo mount -fav
   home/ec2-user/fsx      : successfully mounted


To mount the file share, reboot the Amazon EC2 instance.


When the instance is available again, verify that the file system is mounted by running the following command.


$ sudo mount -l -t cifs
   //file-system-IP-address/file_share on /mnt/fsx type cifs (rw,relatime,vers=3.0,sec=ntlmsspi,cache=strict,username=user1,domain=CORP.EXAMPLE.COM,uid=0,noforceuid,gid=0,noforcegid,addr=192.0.20.0,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755,soft,nounix,serverino,mapposix,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,echo_interval=60,actimeo=1)
The line added to the /etc/fstab file in this procedure does the following at the given points:
    //file-system-IP-address/file_share – Specifies the IP address and share of the Amazon FSx file system you're mounting.
    /mnt/fsx – Specifies the mount point for the FSx file system on your EC2 instance.
    cifs vers=3.0 – Specifies the type of file system as CIFS and the protocol version as 3.0.
    sec=ntlmsspi – Specifies using NT LAN Manager Security Support Provider Interface to facilitate NTLM challenge-response authentication.
    cred=/home/ec2-user/creds.txt – Specifies where to get the user credentials.
    _netdev – Tells the operating system that the file system resides on a device that requires network access. Using this option prevents the instance from mounting the file system until the network service is enabled on the client.
    0 – Indicates that the file system should be backed up by dump, if it's a nonzero value. For Amazon FSx, this value should be 0.
    0 – Specifies the order in which fsck checks file systems at boot. For Amazon FSx file systems, this value should be 0 to indicate that fsck shouldn't run at startup.
