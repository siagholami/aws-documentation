Using Amazon FSx with AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory
AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD) provides fully managed, highly available, actual Active Directory (AD) directories in the cloud. You can use these AD directories in your workload deployment. 
If your organization is using AWS Managed Microsoft AD to manage identities and devices, we recommend that you integrate your Amazon FSx file system with AWS Managed Microsoft AD. By doing this, you get a turnkey solution using Amazon FSx with AWS Managed Microsoft AD. AWS handles the deployment, operation, high availability, reliability, security, and seamless integration of the two services, enabling you to focus on operating your own workload effectively.
To use Amazon FSx with your AWS Managed Microsoft AD setup, you can use the Amazon FSx console. When you create a new Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system in the console, choose AWS Managed AD under the Windows Authentication section. You also choose the specific directory that you want to use. For more information, see Step 1: Create Your File System. 
Your organization might manage identities and devices on a self-managed Active Directory domain (on-premises or in the cloud). If so, you can join your Amazon FSx file system directly to your existing, self-managed AD domain. For more information, see Using Amazon FSx with Your Self-Managed Microsoft Active Directory. 
Additionally, you can also set up your system to benefit from a resource forest isolation model. In this model, you isolate your resources, including your Amazon FSx file systems, into a separate AD forest from the one where your users are. 
Networking Prerequisites
Before you create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system joined to your AWS Microsoft Managed AD domain, make sure that you have created and set up the following network configurations:
  VPC Security Groups that you've associated with your Amazon FSx file system, along with any VPC Network ACLs, configured to allow outbound network traffic on the following ports:   
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
Important
Allowing outbound traffic on TCP port 9389 is required for Single-AZ 2 and all Multi-AZ file system deployments.
 Ensure that you do not delete or modify VPC security groups or ENIs created by the Managed AD service on your behalf.
 Add outbound rules to allow all traffic to the Active Directory that you're joining your file system to. To do this, allow outbound traffic to the security group ID associated with your AWS Microsoft Managed AD directory. 
 If you are connecting your Amazon FSx file system to an AWS Managed Microsoft AD in a different VPC or account, then ensure connectivity between that VPC and the Amazon VPC where you want to create the file system. For more information, see Using Amazon FSx with AWS Managed Microsoft AD in a Different VPC or Account.
Use the Amazon FSx Network Validation tool to test these network settings.
Using a Resource Forest Isolation Model
You join your file system to an AWS Managed Microsoft AD setup. You then establish a one-way forest trust relationship between an AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain that you create and your existing self-managed AD domain. For Windows authentication in Amazon FSx, you only need a one-way directional forest trust, where the AWS managed forest trusts the corporate domain forest.
Your corporate domain takes the role of the trusted domain, and the AWS Directory Service managed domain takes the role of the trusting domain. Validated authentication requests travel between the domains in only one directionâ€”allowing accounts in your corporate domain to authenticate against resources shared in the managed domain. In this case, Amazon FSx interacts only with the managed domain. The managed domain then passes on the authentication requests to your corporate domain.
Test Your Active Directory Configuration
Before creating your Amazon FSx file system, we recommend that you validate your Active Directory configuration using the Amazon FSx Network Validation tool. For more information, see Validating Your Active Directory Configuration.
