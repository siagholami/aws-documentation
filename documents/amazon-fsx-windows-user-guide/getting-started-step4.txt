Step 4: Back Up Your File System
Now that you've had a chance to use your Amazon FSx file system and its file shares, you can back it up. By default, daily backups are created automatically during your file system's 30-minute backup window. However you can create a user-initiated backup at any time. Backups have additional costs associated with them. For more information on backup pricing, see Pricing.
To create a backup of your file system from the console


Open the Amazon FSx console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/.


From the console dashboard, choose the name of the file system you created for this exercise.


From the Overview tab for your file system, choose Create backup.


In the Create backup dialog box that opens, provide a name for your backup. This name can contain a maximum of 256 Unicode letters and include white space, numbers, and the following special characters:  - = . _ : / 


Choose Create backup.


To view all your backups in a list, so you can restore your file system or delete the backup, choose Backups.


When you create a new backup, its status is set to CREATING while it is being created. This can take a few minutes. When the backup is available for use, its status changes to AVAILABLE.
