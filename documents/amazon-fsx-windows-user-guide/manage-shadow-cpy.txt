Setting Shadow Copy Storage
Shadow copies consume storage space on the same file system of which the shadow copies are taken. When you configure shadow copy storage, you define the maximum amount of storage that shadow copies can consume on the file system using the Set-FsxShadowStorage custom PowerShell command. You specify the maximum size that shadow copies can grow to using the -Maxsize or the -Default command options. 
Using -Maxsize, you can define shadow copy storage as follows: 
 In bytes: Set-FsxShadowStorage -Maxsize 2500000000 
 In kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or other units: Set-FsxShadowStorage -Maxsize (2500MB) or Set-FsxShadowStorage -Maxsize (2.5GB) 
 As a percentage of the overall storage: Set-FsxShadowStorage -Maxsize "20%" 
 As undefined: Set-FsxShadowStorage -Maxsize "UNBOUNDED" 
Use -Default to set shadow storage to use up to 10 percent of the file system: Set-FsxShadowStorage -Default. To learn more about using the default option, see Setting Up Shadow Copies Using Default Settings. 
To set the amount of shadow copy storage on an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system


Connect to a compute instance that has network connectivity with your file system as a user that is a member of the file system administrators group. In AWS Managed Microsoft AD, that group is AWS Delegated FSx Administrators. In your self-managed Microsoft AD, that group is Domain Admins or the custom group that you specified for administration when you created your file system. For more information, see Connecting to Your Windows Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances. 


Open a Windows PowerShell window on the compute instance. 


Use the following command to open a remote PowerShell session on your Amazon FSx file system. Replace FSxFileSystem-Remote-PowerShell-Endpoint with the Windows Remote PowerShell endpoint of file system that you want to administer. You can find the Windows Remote PowerShell endpoint in the Amazon FSx console, in the Network & Security section of the file system details screen, or in the response of the DescribeFileSystem API operation. 


PS C:\Users\delegateadmin> enter-pssession -computername FSxFileSystem-Remote-PowerShell-Endpoint -configurationname fsxremoteadmin

Verify that shadow copy storage is not already configured on the file system using the following command.

```
No Fsx Shadow Storage Configured
   ```

Set the amount of shadow storage to 10 percent of the volume using the -Default option. 

```
   fs-1234567890abcef12: PS>Set-FsxShadowStorage -Default
   FSx Shadow Storage Configuration

   -------------- ---------     --------
                0         0  32530536858
   ```
The output shows the shadow storage configuration, as follows:


AllocatedSpace – the amount of storage on the file system in bytes currently allocated to shadow copies. Initially, this value is 0. 
UsedSpace – the amount of storage currently used by shadow copies. Initially, this value is 0. 
MaxSpace - the maximum amount of storage space to which shadow storage can grow. This is the value that you just set. 

Deleting Shadow Copy Storage, Schedule, and All Shadow Copies
You can delete your shadow copy configuration, including all existing shadow copies, along with the shadow copy schedule. At the same time, you can release the shadow copy storage on the file system. 
To do this, enter the Remove-FsxShadowStorage command in a remote PowerShell session on your file system. For instructions on launching a remote PowerShell session on your file system, see Getting Started with the Amazon FSx CLI for Remote Management on PowerShellGetting Started. 
```

Creating a Custom Shadow Copy Schedule
Shadow copy schedules use scheduled task triggers in Microsoft Windows to specify when shadow copies are automatically taken. A shadow copy schedule can have multiple triggers, providing you with a lot of scheduling flexibility. Only one shadow copy schedule can exist at a time. Before you can create a shadow copy schedule, you must first set the amount of shadow copy storage.
When you run the Set-FsxShadowCopySchedule command on a file system, you overwrite any existing shadow copy schedule. Optionally, you can specify the time zone for a trigger using Windows time zones and the -TimezoneId option. For a list of Windows time zones, see Microsoft's Default Timezone documentation or run the following at a Windows command prompt: tzutil /l. To learn more about Windows task triggers, see Task Triggers in Microsoft Windows Developer Center documentation. 
You can also use the -Default option to quickly set up a default shadow copy schedule. To learn more, see Setting Up Shadow Copies Using Default Settings. 
To create a custom shadow copy schedule

Create a set of Windows scheduled task triggers to define when shadow copies are taken in the shadow copy schedule. Use the new-scheduledTaskTrigger command in a PowerShell on your local machine to set multiple triggers. 

This following example creates a custom shadow copy schedule that takes shadow copies every Monday–Friday, at 6:00 AM and at 6:00 PM UTC. By default, times are in UTC, unless you specify a time zone in the Windows scheduled task triggers you create. 
PS C:\Users\delegateadmin> $trigger1 = new-scheduledTaskTrigger -weekly -DaysOfWeek Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday -at 06:00
   PS C:\Users\delegateadmin> $trigger2 = new-scheduledTaskTrigger -weekly -DaysOfWeek Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday -at 18:00

Use invoke-command to run the scriptblock command. Doing so writes a script that sets the shadow copy schedule with the new-scheduledTaskTrigger value that you just created. Replace FSxFileSystem-Remote-PowerShell-Endpoint with the Windows Remote PowerShell endpoint of file system that you want to administer. You can find the Windows Remote PowerShell endpoint in the Amazon FSx console, in the Network & Security section of the file system details screen, or in the response of the DescribeFileSystem API operation.

PS C:\Users\delegateadmin> invoke-command -ComputerName FSxFileSystem-Remote-PowerShell-Endpoint -ConfigurationName FSxRemoteAdmin -scriptblock {

Enter the following line at the >> prompt to set your shadow copy schedule using the set-fsxshadowcopyschedule command.

```


set-fsxshadowcopyschedule -scheduledtasktriggers $Using:trigger1,$Using:trigger2 -Confirm:$false }
   ```


The response displays the shadow copy schedule that you configured on the file system\.

Deleting Shadow Copies
You can delete one or more existing shadow copies on your file system using the Remove-FsxShadowCopies command in a remote PowerShell session on your file system. For instructions on launching a remote PowerShell session on your file system, see Getting Started with the Amazon FSx CLI for Remote Management on PowerShellGetting Started. 
Specify which shadow copies to delete by using one of the following required options: 
  -Oldest deletes the oldest shadow copy 
  -All deletes all existing shadow copies 
  -ShadowCopyId deletes a specific shadow copy by ID. 
You can use only one option with the command. An error occurs if you don't specify which shadow copy to delete, if you specify multiple shadow copy IDs, or if you specify an invalid shadow copy ID. 
To delete the oldest shadow copy on your file system, enter the following command in a remote PowerShell session on your file system.
