## Amazon FSx for Windows File Server Resources: File Systems, Backups, and File Shares<a name="fsx-resources"></a>

The primary resources in Amazon FSx are *file systems* and *backups*\. A file system is where you store and access your files and folders\. A file system is made up of a Windows file server and storage volumes, and is accessed with its DNS name\. When you create a file system, you specify an amount of storage capacity \(in GiB\) and an amount of throughput capacity \(in MB/s\)\. You can modify these properties as your needs change\. For more information, see [Managing Storage Capacity](managing-storage-capacity.md) and [Managing Throughput Capacity](managing-throughput-capacity.md)\. 

Amazon FSx for Windows File Server backups are file\-system\-consistent, highly durable, and incremental\. To ensure file system consistency, Amazon FSx uses the Volume Shadow Copy Service \(VSS\) in Microsoft Windows\. Automatic daily backups are turned on by default when you create a file system, and you can also take additional manual backups at anytime\. For more information, see [Working with Backups](using-backups.md),

A Windows file share is a specific folder \(and its subfolders\) within your file system that you make accessible to your compute instances with SMB\. Your file system already comes with a default Windows file share called `\share`\. You can create and manage as many other Windows file shares as you want by using the Shared Folders graphical user interface \(GUI\) tool on Windows\. For more information, see [Using Microsoft Windows File Shares](using-file-shares.md)\.

### Accessing File Shares<a name="fsx-access-shares"></a>

Amazon FSx is accessible from compute instances with the SMB protocol \(supporting versions 2\.0 to 3\.1\.1\)\. You can access your shares from all Windows versions starting from Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7, and also from current versions of Linux\. You can map your Amazon FSx file shares on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances, and on Amazon WorkSpaces instances, Amazon AppStream 2\.0 instances, and VMware Cloud on AWS VMs\. 

You can access your file shares from on\-premises compute instances using AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN\. In addition to accessing file shares that are in the same VPC, AWS account, and AWS Region as the file system, you can also access your shares on compute instances that are in a different Amazon VPC, account, or Region\. You do so using VPC peering or transit gateways\. For more information, see [Supported Access Methods](supported-fsx-clients.md#access-methods)\. 

## Security and Data Protection<a name="security-considerations"></a>

Amazon FSx provides multiple levels of security and compliance to help ensure that your data is protected\. It automatically encrypts data at rest \(for both file systems and backups\) using keys that you manage in AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\)\. Data in transit is also automatically encrypted using SMB Kerberos session keys\. It has been assessed to comply with ISO, PCI\-DSS, and SOC certifications, and is HIPAA eligible\.

Amazon FSx provides access control at the file and folder level with Windows access control lists \(ACLs\)\. It provides access control at the file system level using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) security groups\. In addition, it provides access control at the API level using AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) access policies\. Users accessing file systems are authenticated with Microsoft Active Directory\. Amazon FSx integrates with AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log your API calls letting you see actions taken by users on your Amazon FSx resources\.

Additionally, it protects your data by taking highly durable backups of your file system automatically on a daily basis and allows you to take additional backups at any point\. For more information, see [Security in Amazon FSx](security.md)\.

## Availability and Durability<a name="avail_durability"></a>

Amazon FSx for Windows File Server oï¬€ers file systems with two levels of availability and durability\. Single\-AZ files ensure high availability within a single Availability Zone \(AZ\) by automatically detecting and addressing component failures\. In addition, Multi\-AZ file systems provide high availability and failover support across multiple Availability Zones by provisioning and maintaining a standby file server in a separate Availability Zone within an AWS Region\. To learn more about Single\-AZ and Multi\-AZ file system deployments, see [Availability and Durability: Single\-AZ and Multi\-AZ File Systems](high-availability-multiAZ.md)\.

## Managing File Systems<a name="managing-FSxW"></a>

You can administer your Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems using custom remote management PowerShell commands, or using the Windows\-native GUI in some cases\. To learn more about managing Amazon FSx file systems, see [Administering File Systems](administering-file-systems.md)\.

## Price and Performance Flexibility<a name="price-perf-flexibility"></a>

Amazon FSx for Windows File Server gives you the price and performance flexibility by offering both solid state drive \(SSD\) and hard disk drive \(HDD\) storage types\. HDD storage is designed for a broad spectrum of workloads, including home directories, user and departmental shares, and content management systems\.
