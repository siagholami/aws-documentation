Creating CloudWatch Alarms to Monitor Amazon FSx
You can create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an Amazon SNS message when the alarm changes state. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period you specify, and performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic or Auto Scaling policy.
Alarms invoke actions for sustained state changes only. CloudWatch alarms don't invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state; the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods. You can create an alarm from the Amazon FSx console or the CloudWatch console.
The following procedures describe how to create alarms for Amazon FSx using the console, AWS CLI, and API.
To set alarms using the Amazon FSx console


Open the Amazon FSx console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/.


From the navigation pane, choose File systems, and then choose the file system you want to create the alarm for.


Choose the Actions menu, and choose View details. 


On the Summary page, choose Alarms. 


Choose Create CloudWatch alarm. You are redirected to the CloudWatch console.


Choose Select metrics, and choose Next.


In the Metrics section, choose FSX.


Choose File System Metrics, choose the metric you want to set the alarm for, and then choose Select metric.


In the Conditions section, choose the conditions you want for the alarm, and choose Next.


If you want CloudWatch to send you an email or SNS notification when the alarm state triggers the action, choose an alarm state for Whenever this alarm state is. 


For select an SNS topic, choose an existing SNS topic. If you select Create topic, you can set the name and email addresses for a new email subscription list. This list is saved and appears in the field for future alarms. Choose Next.
Note
If you use Create topic to create a new Amazon SNS topic, the email addresses must be verified before they receive notifications. Emails are only sent when the alarm enters an alarm state. If this alarm state change happens before the email addresses are verified, they do not receive a notification.


Fill in the Name, Description, and Whenever values for the metric, and choose Next. 


On the Preview and create page, review the alarm you're about to create, and then choose Create Alarm. 


To set alarms using the CloudWatch console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


Choose Create Alarm to start the Create Alarm Wizard. 


Choose FSx Metrics, and scroll through the Amazon FSx metrics to locate the metric you want to place an alarm on. To display just the Amazon FSx metrics in this dialog box, search on the file system ID of your file system. Select the metric to create an alarm on, and choose Next.


Fill in the Name, Description, and Whenever values for the metric. 


If you want CloudWatch to send you an email when the alarm state is reached, for Whenever this alarm, choose State is ALARM. For Send notification to, choose an existing SNS topic. If you select Create topic, you can set the name and email addresses for a new email subscription list. This list is saved and appears in the field for future alarms.
Note
If you use Create topic to create a new Amazon SNS topic, the email addresses must be verified before they receive notifications. Emails are only sent when the alarm enters an alarm state. If this alarm state change happens before the email addresses are verified, they do not receive a notification.
