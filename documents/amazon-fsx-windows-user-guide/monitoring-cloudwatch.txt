Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch
You can monitor file systems using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from Amazon FSx for Windows File Server into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are retained for a period of 15 months, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing. By default, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch at 1-minute periods. For more information about CloudWatch, see What Is Amazon CloudWatch? in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
As with Amazon EFS, Amazon S3, and Amazon EBS, Amazon FSx CloudWatch metrics are reported as raw Bytes. Bytes are not rounded to either a decimal or binary multiple of the unit.
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server publishes the following metrics into the AWS/FSx namespace in CloudWatch. For each metric, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server emits a data point per file system per minute.



Metric
Description




DataReadBytes
The number of bytes for file system read operations. The Sum statistic is the total number of bytes associated with read operations during the period. To calculate the average throughput (Bytes per second) for a period, divide the Sum statistic by the number of seconds in the period. Units: Bytes Valid statistics: Sum


DataWriteBytes
The number of bytes for file system write operations. The Sum statistic is the total number of bytes associated with write operations during the period. To calculate the average throughput (Bytes per second) for a period, divide the Sum statistic by the number of seconds in the period. Units: Bytes Valid statistics: Sum


DataReadOperations
The number of read operations. The Sum statistic is the count of read operations during the time period. To calculate the average number of read operations (operations per second) for a period, divide the Sum statistic by the number of seconds in the period. Units: Count Valid statistics: Sum


DataWriteOperations
The number of write operations. The Sum statistic is the count of write operations during the time period. To calculate the average number of write operations (operations per second) for a period, divide the Sum statistic by the number of seconds in the period. Units: Count Valid statistics: Sum


MetadataOperations
The number of metadata operations. The Sum statistic is the count of metadata operations during the time period. To calculate the average number of metadata operations (operations per second) for a period, divide the Sum statistic by the number of seconds in the period. Units: Count Valid statistics: Sum


FreeStorageCapacity
The amount of available storage capacity. Units: Bytes Valid statistics: Average, Minimum



Amazon FSx for Windows File Server Dimensions
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server metrics use the FSx namespace and provide metrics for a single dimension, FileSystemId. You can find a file system's ID using the aws fsx describe-file-systems AWS CLI command or the DescribeFileSystems API command. A file system ID takes the form of fs-0123456789abcdef0.
