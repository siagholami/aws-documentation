### Lumberyard Launcher is now Lumberyard Setup Assistant – New name, same great functionality<a name="lumberyard-v1.2-highlights-setup-assistant"></a>

Lumberyard Launcher has been renamed to Lumberyard Setup Assistant. The Lumberyard Setup Assistant ensures you have the necessary runtime software and SDKs installed to successfully run Lumberyard. The Lumberyard Setup Assistant detects missing components and allows you to install those and other software required for your role on a game team. Run `SetupAssistant.exe` from the `\dev\Bin64` folder. For more information, see [Using Setup Assistant to Set up Your Development Environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/lumberyard-launcher-intro.html).
