+ Fixed the symmetric field of view (FOV) calculation for OpenVR.
+ Fixed a tracking issue for OpenVR where waiting for vsync could happen twice in one frame.
+ Fixed an issue that prevented the coverage buffer from working properly in VR. You can now use CPU-side object culling.

**Miscellaneous**
+ Updated the Asset Processor so that it no longer treats newly imported `i_caf` files as failures until an animsettings file is created.
+ Fixed an issue that prevented shader parameters from overloading on cloned materials when the render thread is enabled (`r_multithreaded=1`).
+ Fixed an issue that prevented the **Decal** texture from being animated and used to control the intensity of emittance in the Illum shader.
+ Fixed an issue that prevented occlusion meshes from being sorted properly.
