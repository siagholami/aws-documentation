### New Sample Level Demonstrates Particle Effects<a name="lumberyard-v1.5-highlights-particles-sample-level"></a>

The Particles Sample level showcases particles from the various Lumberyard systems and demonstrates how to create high quality effects using simple and advanced features in the Particle Editor. Currently the sample level includes a fire effect and a laser effect, with plans to add more particles in the future.

### Updated Functionality for UI Canvases and Elements<a name="lumberyard-v1.5-highlights-ui-editor"></a>

Lumberyard Beta 1.5 adds a nudging ability to the UI Editor. Press an arrow key to move UI elements one pixel or **Shift**\+any arrow key to move UI elements 10 pixels. In addition, you can now flag UI canvases to render to a texture. This allows you to use the render target as a texture on a material and display a UI canvas on an object in the 3D world. For more information, see [UI System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ui-editor-intro.html).

### Cloud Canvas Adds an AWS Resource Importer<a name="lumberyard-v1.5-highlights-cloud-canvas"></a>

Cloud Canvas provides a new AWS resource importer that allows you to create AWS resources directly from Lumberyard by importing using Amazon resource names or importing from a list.

### AzTestScanner Supports Integration Tests<a name="lumberyard-v1.5-highlights-aztestscanner"></a>

The AzTestScanner is a tool that you can use to run tests that are built into Lumberyard libraries and executables. The tool simplifies the process by automatically finding libraries and executables to test while allowing you to focus on testing Lumberyard areas of interest. The AzTestScanner now supports integration tests, which are run in the engine with the active project. For more information, see [Using AzTestScanner](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/testing-aztestscanner.html).
