+ Fixed the Lua debugger so that it can now connect to dedicated servers.

The object no longer loses its highlighted status when the context menu is generated and the object is selected. The select/highlight list functionality is now captured when the context menu is created.
+ Ensured that **Remove Component Mesh** now removes the **Mesh** component from multiple selected entities.
+ Prevented component entity properties from being edited when **AI/Physics** is enabled.

+ Ensured that editing the Vec3 values in game tokens now works properly.
+ Updated the assert dialog box to show the relevant part of the file path text by default.
+ Added an error message box if a level fails to be saves. Previously a message appeared in the log window as a warning.
+ Ensured that minimaps are now saved to the correct folder.
+ Added support for mMultiple in-flight `pCachedFileData` is now supported. Each request creates a cached file data and places it in a lock-protected data structure.
