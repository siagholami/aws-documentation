### Use Lua Scripting to Control a Mannequin Controller for a Character<a name="lumberyard-v1.4-highlights-lua-mannequin"></a>

Lumberyard Beta 1.4 provides a new API with which you can control a mannequin controller for a character through Lua scripting. The sample Lua-based state machine (located in the `\Components\Controllable_Chicken` demo level) demonstrates how to use mannequin controller.

Lumberyard Beta 1.4 supports automatic live reloading of skin files in Lumberyard Editor, editor game mode, and PC games, when the files change on disk. This helps you to more easily iterate on these assets.

### Use Gems to Define Cloud Canvas Resource Manager Resource Groups<a name="lumberyard-v1.4-highlights-cloud-canvas"></a>

Lumberyard Beta 1.4 introduces two updates for Cloud Canvas: 
+ You can now use gems to define Cloud Canvas Resource Manager resource groups.
+ The lmbr\_aws command line tool now supports an `import-resource` command that creates definitions from existing AWS resources in a Cloud Canvas Resource Manager resource group. You can use the `list-importable-resources` command to list the available resources for importing.

For more information about resource groups, see [Working with Resource Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/cloud-canvas-ui-rm-resource-groups.html).

You can preview the level in Lumberyard Editor, or you can load the level on a VR device using a standalone launcher. To load the level on a VR device using a standalone launcher, enable the console variables in the `level.cfg` file (located in the `\dev\SamplesProject\Levels\Samples\VR_BoxGarden_Sample` directory). 

### Preview Your UI Canvas to See How Interactive Components Change States<a name="lumberyard-v1.4-highlights-ui-editor"></a>

Lumberyard Beta 1.4 provides a new preview mode in the **UI Editor** so that you can preview your canvas at different screen resolutions and see how interactive components change states without needing to implement code or flow graphs to load your canvas in game. In addition, UI canvases now support mouse-free keyboard and gamepad operation for navigation between elements and interaction with elements. For more information, see [Previewing Canvases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ui-editor-previewing-canvas.html).

### GridMate Supports Encrypted Connections<a name="lumberyard-v1.4-highlights-networking"></a>

Encrypted GridMate connections using OpenSSL datagram transport layer security (DTLS) is now supported. This type of connection helps to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. For more information, see [Networking System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/network-intro.html).

### Amazon GameLift Now Tracks the Health of Each Game Server Process<a name="lumberyard-v1.4-highlights-gamelift"></a>

Amazon GameLift now tracks the health of each game server process in a fleet and automatically terminates and restarts any process that has been reported as unhealthy for three consecutive minutes. By default Amazon GameLift assumes a process is healthy unless it fails to respond to a request for health status. Alternatively, you can implement a customized health check process that lets you define when a process is healthy or unhealthy. For more information, see the [Amazon GameLift Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/).
