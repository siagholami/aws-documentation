## Component Entity System<a name="preview-component-entity-system"></a>

The Component Entity System provides a flexible and intuitive way to configure and manage entities. Complex entity behaviors can be constructed by adding individual components. The Component Entity system employs reflection, serialization, message-passing using the event bus, and the ability to edit component objects in Lumberyard Editor. For more information, see [Component Entity System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/component-intro.html).

## Mannequin<a name="preview-mannequin"></a>

The Mannequin tool organizes and sequences animation clips into logical states (called fragments). Mannequin then executes complex logic to determine which fragment is context-appropriate and synchronizes the animation with gameplay systems, FX, and sounds. For more information, see [Mannequin System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/mannequin-intro.html).

## Project Configurator<a name="preview-project-configurator"></a>

The Project Configurator lets you specify your current Lumberyard project and select any extensions (gems) to include in the game. For more information, see [Project Configurator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/configurator-intro.html).
