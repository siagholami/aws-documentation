## Android<a name="android-improvements-changes-v1.12"></a>

Android has the following improvements and changes:
+ When you pack assets into an Android Package Kit (APK) file, the load times have decreased from minutes to seconds.
+ The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) toolchain is deprecated and disabled. GCC will be removed in a future version.
+ Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is no longer required to build and run Android applications.
+ Enable `JNI_SIGNATURE_VALIDATION` to ensure Android debug builds work correctly.
+ Android now builds and runs with the Unit Testing framework.
+ Support has been added for ARMv8 (64-bit).
+ Support has been added for Android 8.0 Oreo.

## Asset Pipeline<a name="asset-pipeline-improvements-changes-v1.12"></a>

The asset pipeline has the following improvements and changes:

**Asset Browser**
+ Processed assets have a basic control that distinguishes them as processed assets and not as assets on disk.
+ Use new APIs to customize interactive behavior for your custom assets.
+ Double-click an asset field in the **Entity Inspector** to open the file in the default editor. You can then double-click the assigned scripts, materials, and other files to quickly open and edit the file.

**Asset Processor**
+ To reduce the number of unnecessary `.actor` files that are created when you add `.fbx` files, the **Asset Processor** no longer generates an `.actor` file if the `.fbx` file has an animation.
+ You can now specify new operating systems and tag them in the `AssetProcessorPlatformConfig.ini` file with specific attributes.
+ BuilderSDK builders make content decisions based on the platforms and tags that are present and enabled in a build.
+ You can define build options with tags, such as renderer or mobile, instead of using operating system names.
+ Reporting has been improved for asset processing.
+ AssetBuilderSDK builders run in an external executable file, which prevents builders from crashing the **Asset Processor** and allows builders to run in parallel without concern for thread safety.

## Audio<a name="audio-improvements-changes-v1.12"></a>

The audio system has the following improvements and changes:
+ Error logging has been improved when you encounter duplicate Audio Translation Layer (ATL) switches and Real-Time Parameter Controls (RTPC).
+ The **File Cache Manager** code has been cleaned up.
+ The **Audio Trigger** component has added an obstruction ray casting type. This allows you to specify **Ignore**, **Single Ray**, or **Multi Ray** obstruction ray casting.
+ The `pAudioSystem` pointer under `gEnv` is deprecated and has been removed. You can now interact with the audio system through EBus.

## Cloud Canvas<a name="cloud-canvas-improvements-changes-v1.12"></a>

Cloud Canvas has the following improvements and changes:

**Text-to-Speech Cloud Gem**
+ Amazon Polly is accessible worldwide from the following AWS regions: Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), South America (SÃ£o Paulo), US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and US West (Northern California). You must deploy your stack in one of these regions to use Amazon Polly. For more information about supported regions, see the [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).

## Component Entity System<a name="component-entity-system-improvements-changes-v1.12"></a>

The component entity system has the following improvements and changes:
+ You can now specify whether an entity is active by default upon game start. To do so, choose an entity in the viewport and then select the **Start Active** check box in the **Entity Inspector**.
+ The search and filter functionality in the **Entity Outliner** has been updated, including changes to the user interface.
+ To remove ambiguity, one of the `DestroyEntity` methods was renamed to `DestroyEntityById`.
+ Various component entities were created to replace legacy entities for graphics features. These component entities include **Rain**, **Snow**, **Lightning**, and **GeomCache**.
+ The editor no longer stops working if you add the **Light** and **High Quality Shadow** components to the same entity and then disable the light visibility.
+ The **CryEntity Converter** now converts additional legacy components to new component entities.
+ Use the visibility toggle to display shape components in the editor, even if the shape components are not selected.
+ You can now search for components or field names in the **Entity Inspector**.

## Documentation<a name="documentation-improvements-changes-v1.12"></a>

You can now search the Lumberyard documentation in the editor.
