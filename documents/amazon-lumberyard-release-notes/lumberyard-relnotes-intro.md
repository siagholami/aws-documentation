# Lumberyard Release Notes<a name="lumberyard-relnotes-intro"></a>

Lumberyard is a free AAA game engine deeply integrated with AWS and Twitch – with full source. With Lumberyard, you get a growing set of tools to help create the highest quality games, engage massive communities of fans, and connect to the vast compute and storage of the cloud.

As we continue to improve Lumberyard, we want to thank everyone in our developer community. Without your participation in the forums, your messages, and your bug reports, Lumberyard wouldn't be as strong as it is. Keep sending your feedback to lumberyard-feedback@amazon.com. If you haven't spoken up on the [forums](https://forums.awsgametech.com/) yet, we would love to have you. You can also keep up with new changes on [our blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/?filtered-posts.q=Lumberyard&filtered-posts.q_operator=AND&awsf.blog-master-category=category%23game-development) and leave comments to let us know what you think.
