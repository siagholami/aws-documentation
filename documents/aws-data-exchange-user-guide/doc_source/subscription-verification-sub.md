# Subscription Verification for Subscribers<a name="subscription-verification-sub"></a>

For various reasons, including compliance or regulatory reasons, some data providers might choose to restrict access to their products using subscription verification\. When you subscribe to these data products, you are required to submit additional information about who you are and your intended use\-case\. The provider reviews this information before approving subscriptions\.

For products that require subscription verification, when you choose **Continue** to subscribe on a product page, a subscription request page appears\. You must provide the following information:
+ Your company name
+ Your name
+ Your email address
+ Your intended use case for the data product, along with any other comments that the provider might find useful when reviewing the subscription request
+ Your AWS account ID \(added automatically\) 

After you submit your request, the provider has up to 45 days to approve or decline your request\. To review your pending subscription requests, sign in the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Data Exchange console\. Choose **Subscriptions**, and then choose **Subscription requests**\. After a provider approves your request, the subscription appears on the **Subscriptions** page\.

Each subscription request is uniquely identified by its ID\. The ID is visible to both the provider and the subscriber\. You can use the subscription request ID to identify the request in your communications with the provider\.

**Note**  
You can cancel a pending subscription request at any time as long as it hasn't expired or already been processed\.

## Email Notifications<a name="email-notifications-sub"></a>

You will receive an email notification to your AWS account's email address when your request is approved, declined, or when it expires\. Although most subscription request status changes result in an email notification, the delivery of these emails is on a best\-effort basis\.

**Note**  
You will not receive email notifications for subscription request status changes that you have initiated yourself \(for example, cancelling a subscription\)\.
