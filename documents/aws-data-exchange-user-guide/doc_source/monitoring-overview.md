# Monitoring<a name="monitoring-overview"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of AWS Data Exchange and your other AWS solutions\. AWS provides the following monitoring tools to watch AWS Data Exchange, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when appropriate:
+ Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near real\-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources\. CloudWatch Events enables automated event\-driven computing, because you can write rules that watch for certain events and trigger automated actions in other AWS services when these events occur\. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/)\.
+ Amazon CloudWatch Logs makes it possible for you to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other sources\. CloudWatch Logs can monitor information in the log files and notify you when certain thresholds are met\. You can also archive your log data in highly durable storage\. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/)\.
+ AWS CloudTrail captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred\.
