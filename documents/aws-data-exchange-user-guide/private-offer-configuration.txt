Create Private Offers
As a data provider, you can provide your data product to a subscriber at terms that are different from the offer terms available to the general public. Private offers allow you to create a custom offer for one or more AWS accounts. A private offer can be different from the public offer in any dimension, including price, duration, data subscription agreement, or refund policy.
As a provider, after you have created a product and an offer that is publicly available to all subscribers, you can then create a private offer and make it available to a group of subscribers of your choosing.
To create a private offer


From the left navigation pane of the console, choose Products, and then choose the product for which you want to make a private offer.


From the Private offer tab, choose Create.


On the Select Offer Type page, select Private offer, and choose Next.


Under Account ID, enter the 12-digit account number of the account you are creating a private offer for. Because a single private offer can be extended to multiple accounts, you can add more than one account.


Under Description, provide a short description of the account (for example, the company name of the account).


Provide the offer details, including the pricing information, U.S. sales tax and use settings, data subscription agreement, and support information.
Note
The Set expiry date is the date by which the subscriber must accept the offer. The private offer is no longer available if not accepted by this date.


Choose Next. After you validate the information is correct, choose Complete.


Note
Private offers aren't renewed automatically. You must create another private offer upon expiry.
