Create Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS) Offers
As a data provider, you might already have subscribers for your data products. Bring your own subscription (BYOS) offers allow you to migrate and fulfill existing subscriptions with AWS customers at no additional cost. Before you create a BYOS offer, you need to make the data product publicly available to other AWS customers on AWS Data Exchange.
With BYOS offers, any billing relationship between you and your subscribers continue. BYOS offers are not subject to fulfillment fees. Subscribers receive an AWS Marketplace invoice for the subscription with no charge. After you create a BYOS offer, we review it and contact you if we have any issues or questions.
Because the lifecycle of the subscription begins outside of AWS Data Exchange, the workflow for migrating existing subscription to AWS Data Exchange using BYOS requires collaboration between you and the subscriber.
Important
With BYOS offers, you're migrating a subscription that predates the availability of this product on AWS. AWS might verify your BYOS offer with the existing subscription agreement. If AWS cannot verify your BYOS offer, the offer and entitlements might be revoked without notice.
Here are the steps for creating a BYOS offer on AWS Data Exchange. Before creating or accepting a BYOS offer on AWS Data Exchange, the provider and subscriber should perform the following steps together:
Prerequisites


The provider and the subscriber should contact each other about implementing a BYOS AWS Data Exchange solution.


The subscriber provides the AWS account ID that they want to use to subscribe to data products on AWS Data Exchange.


If you are the provider, follow these steps to create the BYOS offer. The product must be public before you perform these steps.
To create a BYOS offer


Sign in to the AWS Data Exchange console and choose the product for the BYOS offer.


Choose BYOS offers to open the wizard.


Complete the fields in the wizard, including the AWS account ID for the subscriber, and upload the existing DSA or contract you have with the subscriber.


Review the offer and acknowledgement before you accept it.


Choose Publish to create the BYOS offer.


Contact the subscriber and tell them the name of the product. This way, the subscriber can search for the offer in the AWS Data Exchange console.
