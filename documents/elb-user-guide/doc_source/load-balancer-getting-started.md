There are three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers\. You can select a load balancer based on your application needs\. For more information, see [Comparison of Elastic Load Balancing products](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/details/#compare)\.
