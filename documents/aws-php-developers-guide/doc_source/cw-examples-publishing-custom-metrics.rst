   :keywords: Amazon CloudWatch code examples for PHP

Metrics are data about the performance of your systems. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period you
specify. It performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric, relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods.

The following examples show how to:

* Publish metric data using :aws-php-class:`PutMetricData <api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#putmetricdata>`.
* Create an alarm using :aws-php-class:`PutMetricAlarm <api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#putmetricalarm>`.
