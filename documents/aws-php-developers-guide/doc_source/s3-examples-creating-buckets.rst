##################################################################

   :description: Describes how to use Amazon S3 buckets with the AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
   :keywords: Amazon S3 code examples for PHP

The following examples show how to:

* Return a list of buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request using :aws-php-class:`ListBuckets <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#listbuckets>`.
* Create a new bucket using :aws-php-class:`CreateBucket <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#createbucket>`.
* Add an object to a bucket using :aws-php-class:`PutObject <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#putobject>`.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: s3.php.list_buckets.import.txt
   :language: php


List Buckets
============

Create a PHP file with the following code. First create an AWS.S3 client service that specifies the AWS Region and version. Then call the ``listBuckets`` method, which returns all |s3| buckets owned by the sender of the request as an array of Bucket structures.

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: s3.php.list_buckets.main.txt
   :language: php

Create a Bucket
===============

Create a PHP file with the following code. First create an AWS.S3 client service that specifies the AWS Region and version. Then call the ``createBucket`` method with an array as the parameter. The only required field is the key 'Bucket', with a string value for the bucket name to create. However, you can specify the AWS Region with the 'CreateBucketConfiguration' field.  If successful, this method returns the 'Location' of the bucket.

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: s3.php.create_bucket.main.txt
   :language: php

Put an Object in a Bucket
=========================

To add files to your new bucket, create a PHP file with the following code.

In your command line, execute this file and pass in the name of the bucket where you want to upload your file as a string, followed by the full file path to the file to upload.

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: s3.php.put_object.main.txt
   :language: php
