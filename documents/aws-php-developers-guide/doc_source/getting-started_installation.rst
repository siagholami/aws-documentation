Installing the |sdk-php| Version 3
##################################

.. meta::
   :description:  Install the AWS SDK for PHP version 3. 
   :keywords: AWS SDK for PHP version 3, php for aws, install AWS SDK for PHP version 3
   
You can install the |sdk-php| Version 3:

* As a dependency via Composer
* As a prepackaged phar of the SDK
* As a ZIP file of the SDK

Before you install |sdk-php| Version 3 ensure your environment is using PHP version 5.5 or later. Learn more about :doc:`environment requirements and recommendations <getting-started_requirements>`.

.. note::

    Installing the SDK via the .phar and .zip methods requires the `Multibyte String PHP extension <https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php>`_ to be installed and enabled separately.

Install |sdk-php| as a dependency via Composer
==============================================

`Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`_ is the recommended way to install
the |sdk-php|. Composer is a tool for PHP that manages and installs the dependencies of your project.

For more information on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and follow other best
practices for defining dependencies, see `getcomposer.org <http://getcomposer.org>`_.


Install Composer
----------------

If Composer is not already in your project, download and `install Composer <http://getcomposer.org/download>`_. 

   For **Windows**, download and run the `Composer-Setup.exe <https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe>`_. 
   
   For **Linux**, follow the Command-line installation on `the Download Composer page <http://getcomposer.org/download>`_.   


Add |sdk-php| as a dependency via Composer
------------------------------------------

If `Composer is already installed globally <https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally>`_ on your system, run the following in the base directory of your project to install |sdk-php| as a dependency:

   .. code-block:: php

       composer require aws/aws-sdk-php
       
     
Otherwise type this Composer command to install the latest version of the |sdk-php| as a dependency.

   .. code-block:: php

       php -d memory_limit=-1 composer.phar require aws/aws-sdk-php

Add autoloader to your php scripts
----------------------------------
       
To utilize the |sdk-php| in your scripts, include the autoloader in your scripts, as follows.

   .. code-block:: php

       <?php
          require '/path/to/vendor/autoload.php';
       ?>


Installing by Using the Packaged Phar
=====================================

Each release of the |sdk-php| includes a prepackaged phar (PHP archive) that contains all the classes
and dependencies you need to run the SDK. Additionally, the phar automatically registers a class
autoloader for the |sdk-php| and all its dependencies.

You can `download the packaged phar <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.phar>`_
and include it in your scripts.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
       require '/path/to/aws.phar';
    ?>


.. note::

    Using PHP with the Suhosin patch is not recommended, but is common on Ubuntu and Debian distributions.
    In this case, you might need to enable the use of phars in the suhosin.ini. If you don't do this,
    including a phar file in your code will cause a silent failure. To modify suhosin.ini, add the
    following line.

    .. code-block:: php

        suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = phar

Installing by Using the ZIP file
================================

The |sdk-php| includes a ZIP file containing all the classes and dependencies you need to run the SDK.
Additionally, the ZIP file includes a class autoloader for the |sdk-php| and its dependencies.

To install the SDK, `download the .zip file <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.zip>`_,
and then extract it into your project at a location you choose. Then include the autoloader in your scripts, as follows.

.. code-block:: php

     <?php
        require '/path/to/aws-autoloader.php';
     ?>
