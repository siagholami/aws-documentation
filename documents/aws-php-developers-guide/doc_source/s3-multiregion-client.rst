|S3| Multi-Region Client with |sdk-php| Version 3

   :description: Create a multi-region Amazon S3 client using the AWS SDK for PHP version 3 .
   :keywords: Amazon S3, AWS SDK for PHP version 3 examples, Amazon S3 for PHP version 3 code examples


The |sdk-php| Version 3 provides a generic multi-region client that can be used with
any service. This enables users to specify which AWS Region to send a command to by
providing an ``@region`` input parameter to any command. In addition, the SDK
provides a multi-region client for |S3| that responds intelligently to
specific |S3| errors and reroutes commands accordingly. This enables users to use
the same client to talk to multiple Regions. This is a particularly useful feature for
users of the :doc:`s3-stream-wrapper`, whose buckets reside in multiple
Regions.

Basic Usage
===========

The basic usage pattern of an |S3| client is the same whether using a
standard S3 client or its multi-region counterpart. The only usage difference at
the command level is that an AWS Region can be specified using the ``@region`` input
parameter.

.. code-block:: php

    // Create a multi-region S3 client
    $s3Client = (new \Aws\Sdk)->createMultiRegionS3(['version' => 'latest']);

    // You can also use the client constructor
    $s3Client = new \Aws\S3\S3MultiRegionClient([
        'version' => 'latest',
        // Any Region specified while creating the client will be used as the
        // default Region
        'region' => 'us-west-2',
    ]);

    // Get the contents of a bucket
    $objects = $s3Client->listObjects(['Bucket' => $bucketName]);

    // If you would like to specify the Region to which to send a command, do so
    // by providing an @region parameter
    $objects = $s3Client->listObjects([
        'Bucket' => $bucketName,
        '@region' => 'eu-west-1',
    ]);

.. important::

    When using the multi-region |S3| client, you will not encounter any permanent
    redirect exceptions. A standard |S3| client will throw an instance of
    ``Aws\S3\Exception\PermanentRedirectException`` when a command is sent to
    the wrong Region. A multi-region client will instead redispatch the command
    to the correct Region.

Bucket Region Cache
===================

|S3| multi-region clients maintain an internal cache of the AWS Regions in
which given buckets reside. By default, each client has its own in-memory cache.
To share a cache between clients or processes, supply an instance of
``Aws\CacheInterface`` as the ``bucket_region_cache`` option to your
multi-region client.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\DoctrineCacheAdapter;
    use Aws\Sdk;
    use Doctrine\Common\Cache\ApcuCache;

    $sdk = new Aws\Sdk([
        'version' => 'latest',
        'region' => 'us-west-2',
        'S3' => [
            'bucket_region_cache' => new DoctrineCacheAdapter(new ApcuCache),
        ],
    ]);
