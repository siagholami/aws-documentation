   :description: Create write access to private Amazon S3 data using the AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
   :keywords: |S3|, AWS SDK for PHP version 3 examples, Amazon S3 for PHP code examples

Much like pre-signed URLs, pre-signed POSTs enable you to give write access to a
user without giving them AWS credentials. Pre-signed POST forms can be created
with the help of an instance of :aws-php-class:`Aws\S3\PostObjectV4 <class-Aws.S3.PostObjectV4.html>`.

The following examples show how to:

* Get data for an S3 Object POST upload form using :aws-php-class:`PostObjectV4 <class-Aws.S3.PostObjectV4.html>`.

Create PostObjectV4
===================

To create an instance of ``PostObjectV4``, you must provide the following: 

- instance of ``Aws\S3\S3Client``
- bucket
- associative array of form input fields
- array of policy conditions (see :s3-dg:`Policy Construction <HTTPPOSTForms>` in the |S3-dg|)
- expiration time string for the policy (optional, one hour by default).
