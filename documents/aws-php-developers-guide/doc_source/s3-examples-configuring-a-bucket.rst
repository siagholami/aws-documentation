   :description: Get or set CORS configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
   :keywords: Amazon S3 code examples for PHP, AWS SDK for PHP version 3

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. With CORS support in |S3|,
you can build rich client-side web applications with |S3| and selectively allow cross-origin access to your |S3| resources.

For more information about using CORS configuration with an |S3| bucket, see :S3-dg:`Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) <cors>`.

The following examples show how to:

* Get the CORS configuration for a bucket using :aws-php-class:`GetBucketCors <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#getbucketcors>`.
* Set the CORS configuration for a bucket using :aws-php-class:`PutBucketCors <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#putbucketcors>`.

Get the CORS Configuration
==========================

Create a PHP file with the following code. First create an AWS.S3 client service, then call the ``getBucketCors`` method and specify the bucket whose CORS configuration you want.

The only parameter required is the name of the selected bucket. If the bucket currently has a CORS configuration, that configuration is returned by |S3| as a
:aws-php-class:`CORSRules object <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#shape-corsrule>`.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: s3.php.get_bucket_cors.import.txt
   :language: php

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: s3.php.get_bucket_cors.main.txt
   :language: php

Set the CORS Configuration
==========================

Create a PHP file with the following code. First create an AWS.S3 client service. Then call the ``putBucketCors`` method and specify the bucket whose CORS configuration
to set, and the CORSConfiguration as a :aws-php-class:`CORSRules JSON object <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#shape-corsrule>`.
