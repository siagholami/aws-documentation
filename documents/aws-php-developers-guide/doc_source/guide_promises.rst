Promises in the |sdk-php| Version 3

   :description: Set up asynchronous work flow for AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for PHP version 3 promises, asynchronous AWS SDK for PHP version 3 

The |sdk-php| uses **promises** to allow for asynchronous workflows, and
this asynchronicity allows HTTP requests to be sent concurrently. The promise
specification used by the SDK is `Promises/A+ <https://promisesaplus.com/>`_.

What Is a Promise?
==================

A *promise* represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The
primary way of interacting with a promise is through its ``then`` method. This method
registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason
why the promise can't be fulfilled.

The |sdk-php| relies on the `guzzlehttp/promises <https://github.com/guzzle/promises>`_
Composer package for its promises implementation. Guzzle promises support
blocking and non-blocking workflows and can be used with any non-blocking event
loop.

.. note::

    HTTP requests are sent concurrently in the |sdk-php| using a
    single thread, in which non-blocking calls are used to transfer one or more
    HTTP requests while reacting to state changes (e.g., fulfilling or
    rejecting promises).

Promises in the SDK
===================

Promises are used throughout the SDK. For example, promises are used in most
high-level abstractions provided by the SDK: :ref:`paginators <async_paginators>`,
:ref:`waiters <async_waiters>`, :ref:`command pools <command_pool>`,
:doc:`multipart uploads <s3-multipart-upload>`,
:doc:`S3 directory/bucket transfers <s3-transfer>`, and so on.

All of the clients that the SDK provides return promises when you invoke any
of the ``Async`` suffixed methods. For example, the following code shows how to
create a promise for getting the results of an |DDBlong| ``DescribeTable``
operation.

.. code-block:: php

    $client = new Aws\DynamoDb\DynamoDbClient([
        'region'  => 'us-west-2',
        'version' => 'latest',
    ]);

    // This will create a promise that will eventually contain a result
    $promise = $client->describeTableAsync(['TableName' => 'mytable']);

Notice that you can call either ``describeTable`` or ``describeTableAsync``.
These methods are magic ``__call`` methods on a client that are powered by the
API model and ``version`` number associated with the client. By calling methods
like ``describeTable`` without the ``Async`` suffix, the client will block
while it sends an HTTP request and either return an ``Aws\ResultInterface``
object or throw an ``Aws\Exception\AwsException``. By suffixing the operation
name with ``Async`` (i.e., ``describeTableAsync``) the client will create a
promise that is eventually fulfilled with an ``Aws\ResultInterface``
object or rejected with an ``Aws\Exception\AwsException``.

.. important::

    When the promise is returned, the result might have already arrived (for
    example, when using a mock handler), or the HTTP request might not have
    been initiated.

You can register a callback with the promise by using the ``then`` method. This
method accepts two callbacks, ``$onFulfilled`` and ``$onRejected``, both of
which are optional. The ``$onFulfilled`` callback is invoked if the promise
is fulfilled, and the ``$onRejected`` callback is invoked if the promise is
rejected (meaning it failed).

.. code-block:: php

    $promise->then(
        function ($value) {
            echo "The promise was fulfilled with {$value}";
        },
        function ($reason) {
            echo "The promise was rejected with {$reason}";
        }
    );

Executing Commands Concurrently
-------------------------------

Multiple promises can be composed together such that they are executed
concurrently. This can be achieved by integrating the SDK with a non-blocking
event loop, or by building up multiple promises and waiting on them to complete
concurrently.

.. code-block:: php

    use GuzzleHttp\Promise;

    $sdk = new Aws\Sdk([
        'version' => 'latest',
        'region'  => 'us-west-2'
    ]);

    $s3 = $sdk->createS3();
    $ddb = $sdk->createDynamoDb();

    $promises = [
        'buckets' => $s3->listBucketsAsync(),
        'tables'  => $ddb->listTablesAsync(),
    ];

    // Wait on both promises to complete and return the results
    $results = Promise\unwrap($promises);

    // Notice that this method will maintain the input array keys
    var_dump($results['buckets']->toArray());
    var_dump($results['tables']->toArray());

.. tip::

    The :ref:`CommandPool <command_pool>` provides a more powerful
    mechanism for executing multiple API operations concurrently.

Chaining Promises
=================

One of the best aspects of promises is that they are composable, allowing you
to create transformation pipelines. Promises are composed by chaining ``then``
callbacks with subsequent ``then`` callbacks. The return value of a ``then``
method is a promise that is fulfilled or rejected based on the result of the
provided callbacks.

.. code-block:: php

    $promise = $client->describeTableAsync(['TableName' => 'mytable']);

    $promise
        ->then(
            function ($value) {
                $value['AddedAttribute'] = 'foo';
                return $value;
            },
            function ($reason) use ($client) {
                // The call failed. You can recover from the error here and
                // return a value that will be provided to the next successful
                // then() callback. Let's retry the call.
                return $client->describeTableAsync(['TableName' => 'mytable']);
            }
        )->then(
            function ($value) {
                // This is only invoked when the previous then callback is
                // fulfilled. If the previous callback returned a promise, then
                // this callback is invoked only after that promise is
                // fulfilled.
                echo $value['AddedAttribute']; // outputs "foo"
            },
            function ($reason) {
                // The previous callback was rejected (failed).
            }
        );

.. note::

    The return value of a promise callback is the ``$value`` argument that
    is supplied to downstream promises. If you want to provide a value to downstream
    promise chains, you must return a value in the callback
    function.

Rejection Forwarding
--------------------

You can register a callback to invoke when a promise is rejected. If an
exception is thrown in any callback, the promise is rejected with the
exception and the next promises in the chain are rejected with the
exception. If you return a value successfully from an ``$onRejected`` callback,
the next promises in the promise chain is fulfilled with the return
value from the ``$onRejected`` callback.

Waiting on Promises
===================

You can synchronously force promises to complete by using a promise's ``wait``
method.

.. code-block:: php

    $promise = $client->listTablesAsync();
    $result = $promise->wait();

If an exception is encountered while invoking the ``wait`` function of a promise,
the promise is rejected with the exception and the exception is thrown.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\Exception\AwsException;

    $promise = $client->listTablesAsync();

    try {
        $result = $promise->wait();
    } catch (AwsException $e) {
        // Handle the error
    }

Calling ``wait`` on a promise that has been fulfilled doesn't trigger the wait
function. It simply returns the previously delivered value.

.. code-block:: php

    $promise = $client->listTablesAsync();
    $result = $promise->wait();
    assert($result ### $promise->wait());

Calling ``wait`` on a promise that has been rejected throws an exception. If
the rejection reason is an instance of ``\Exception`` the reason is thrown.
Otherwise, a ``GuzzleHttp\Promise\RejectionException`` is thrown and the reason
can be obtained by calling the ``getReason`` method of the exception.

.. note::

    API operation calls in the |sdk-php| are rejected with subclasses of the
    ``Aws\Exception\AwsException`` class. However, it's possible that the
    reason delivered to a ``then`` method is different because the addition of
    a custom middleware that alters a rejection reason.

Canceling Promises
==================

Promises can be canceled using the ``cancel()`` method of a promise. If a
promise has already been resolved, calling ``cancel()`` will have no
effect. Canceling a promise cancels the promise and any promises that are
awaiting delivery from the promise. A canceled promise is rejected with a
``GuzzleHttp\Promise\RejectionException``.

Combining Promises
==================

You can combine promises into aggregate promises to build more sophisticated
workflows. The ``guzzlehttp/promise`` package contains various functions that
you can use to combine promises.

You can find the API documentation for all of the promise collection functions
at :aws-php-class:`namespace-GuzzleHttp.Promise <namespace-GuzzleHttp.Promise.html>`.

each and each_limit
-------------------

Use the :ref:`CommandPool <command_pool>` when you have a task queue of
``Aws\CommandInterface`` commands to perform concurrently with a fixed pool
size (the commands can be in memory or yielded by a lazy iterator). The
``CommandPool`` ensures that a fixed number of commands are sent concurrently
until the supplied iterator is exhausted.

The ``CommandPool`` works only with commands that are executed by the same client.
You can use the ``GuzzleHttp\Promise\each_limit`` function to perform send
commands of different clients concurrently using a fixed pool size.

.. code-block:: php

    use GuzzleHttp\Promise;

    $sdk = new Aws\Sdk([
        'version' => 'latest',
        'region'  => 'us-west-2'
    ]);

    $s3 = $sdk->createS3();
    $ddb = $sdk->createDynamoDb();

    // Create a generator that yields promises
    $promiseGenerator = function () use ($s3, $ddb) {
        yield $s3->listBucketsAsync();
        yield $ddb->listTablesAsync();
        // yield other promises as needed...
    };

    // Execute the tasks yielded by the generator concurrently while limiting the
    // maximum number of concurrent promises to 5
    $promise = Promise\each_limit($promiseGenerator(), 5);

    // Waiting on an EachPromise will wait on the entire task queue to complete
    $promise->wait();

Promise Coroutines
------------------

One of the more powerful features of the Guzzle promises library is that it
allows you to use promise coroutines that make writing asynchronous workflows
seem more like writing traditional synchronous workflows. In fact, the |sdk-php|
uses coroutine promises in most of the high-level abstractions.

Imagine you wanted to create several buckets and upload a file to the bucket
when the bucket becomes available, and you'd like to do this all concurrently
so that it happens as fast as possible. You can do this easily by combining
multiple coroutine promises together using the ``all()`` promise function.

.. code-block:: php

    use GuzzleHttp\Promise;

    $uploadFn = function ($bucket) use ($s3Client) {
        return Promise\coroutine(function () use ($bucket, $s3Client) {
            // You can capture the result by yielding inside of parens
            $result = (yield $s3Client->createBucket(['Bucket' => $bucket]));
            // Wait on the bucket to be available
            $waiter = $s3Client->getWaiter('BucketExists', ['Bucket' => $bucket]);
            // Wait until the bucket exists
            yield $waiter->promise();
            // Upload a file to the bucket
            yield $s3Client->putObjectAsync([
                'Bucket' => $bucket,
                'Key'    => '_placeholder',
                'Body'   => 'Hi!'
            ]);
        });
    };

    // Create the following buckets
    $buckets = ['foo', 'baz', 'bar'];
    $promises = [];

    // Build an array of promises
    foreach ($buckets as $bucket) {
        $promises[] = $uploadFn($bucket);
    }

    // Aggregate the promises into a single "all" promise
    $aggregate = Promise\all($promises);

    // You can then() off of this promise or synchronously wait
    $aggregate->wait();
