|S3| Client-Side Encryption with the |sdk-php| Version 3
########################################################

   :description: Client-side encryption for the Amazon S3 client with the AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for PHP version 3 constructor, AWS SDK for PHP version 3 client configuration

With client-side encryption, data is encrypted and decrypted directly in your environment. This
means that this data is encrypted before it's transferred to |S3|, and you
don’t rely on an external service to handle encryption for you. For new implementations,
we suggest the use of ``S3EncryptionClientV2`` and ``S3EncryptionMultipartUploaderV2`` over the deprecated
``S3EncryptionClient`` and ``S3EncryptionMultipartUploader``. It is recommended that older implementations
still using the deprecated versions attempt to migrate. ``S3EncryptionClientV2`` maintains
support for decrypting data that was encrypted using the legacy ``S3EncryptionClient``.

The |sdk-php| implements :KMS-dg:`envelope encryption <workflow>`
and uses `OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org/>`_ for its encrypting and
decrypting. The implementation is interoperable with :AWS-gr:`other SDKs that match its feature support <aws_sdk_cryptography>`.
It's also compatible with :doc:`the SDK’s promise-based asynchronous workflow <guide_promises>`.

Migration Guide
==========

For those who are trying to migrate to from the deprecated clients to the new clients, there is a migration
guide which can be found `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/v3/developer-guide/s3-encryption-migration.html>`_.

Setup
=====

To get started with client-side encryption, you need the following:

* An :KMS-dg:`AWS KMS encryption key <create-keys>`
* An :S3-gsg:`S3 bucket <CreatingABucket>`

Before running any example code, configure your AWS credentials. See :doc:`guide_credentials`.

Encryption
==========

Uploading an encrypted object in ``S3EncryptionClientV2`` takes three additional parameters on top of
the standard ``PutObject`` parameters:

* ``'@KmsEncryptionContext'`` is a key-value pair which can be used to add an extra layer of security to
  your encrypted object. The encryption client must pass in the same key, which it will automatically do
  on a get call. If no additional context is desired, pass in an empty array.
* ``@CipherOptions`` are additional configurations for the encryption including which cipher to use and keysize.
* ``@MaterialsProvider`` is a provider which handles generating a cipher key and initialization vector, as
  well as encrypting your cipher key.

.. code-block:: php

   use Aws\S3\S3Client;
   use Aws\S3\Crypto\S3EncryptionClientV2;
   use Aws\Kms\KmsClient;
   use Aws\Crypto\KmsMaterialsProviderV2;

    // Let's construct our S3EncryptionClient using an S3Client
    $encryptionClient = new S3EncryptionClientV2(
        new S3Client([
            'profile' => 'default',
            'region' => 'us-east-1',
            'version' => 'latest',
        ])
    );

    $kmsKeyId = 'kms-key-id';
    $materialsProvider = new KmsMaterialsProviderV2(
        new KmsClient([
            'profile' => 'default',
            'region' => 'us-east-1',
            'version' => 'latest',
        ]),
        $kmsKeyId
    );

    $bucket = 'the-bucket-name';
    $key = 'the-file-name';
    $cipherOptions = [
        'Cipher' => 'gcm',
        'KeySize' => 256,
        // Additional configuration options
    ];

    $result = $encryptionClient->putObject([
        '@MaterialsProvider' => $materialsProvider,
        '@CipherOptions' => $cipherOptions,
        '@KmsEncryptionContext' => ['context-key' => 'context-value'],
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key' => $key,
        'Body' => fopen('file-to-encrypt.txt', 'r'),
    ]);

.. note::

    In addition to the |S3| and |KMS|-based service errors, you might
    receive thrown ``InvalidArgumentException`` objects if your
    ``'@CipherOptions'`` are not correctly configured.

Decryption
==========

Downloading and decrypting an object has four additional parameters, two of which are required, on top of the standard
``GetObject`` parameters.  The client will detect the basic cipher options for you.

* ``'@SecurityProfile'``:  If set to ‘V2’, only objects that are encrypted in V2-compatible
   format can be decrypted. Setting this parameter to ‘V2_AND_LEGACY’ also allows objects
   encrypted in V1-compatible format to be decrypted. To support migration, set @SecurityProfile
   to ‘V2_AND_LEGACY’. Use ‘V2’ only for new application development.
* ``'@MaterialsProvider'`` is a provider which handles generating a cipher key and initialization vector, as
   well as encrypting your cipher key.
* ``'@KmsAllowDecryptWithAnyCmk'``: (optional) Setting this parameter to true enables decryption
   without supplying a KMS key id to the constructor of the MaterialsProvider. The default value is false.
* ``'@CipherOptions'`` (optional) are additional configurations for the encryption including which
   cipher to use and keysize.

.. code-block:: php

    $result = $encryptionClient->getObject([
        '@KmsAllowDecryptWithAnyCmk' => true,
        '@SecurityProfile' => 'V2_AND_LEGACY',
        '@MaterialsProvider' => $materialsProvider,
        '@CipherOptions' => $cipherOptions,
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key' => $key,
    ]);

.. note::

    In addition to the |S3| and |KMS|-based service errors, you might
    receive thrown ``InvalidArgumentException`` objects if your
    ``'@CipherOptions'`` are not correctly configured.

Cipher Configuration
====================

``'Cipher'`` (string)
    Cipher method that the encryption client uses while
    encrypting. Only 'gcm' is supported at this time.

.. important::

    PHP is `updated in version 7.1 <http://php.net/manual/en/migration71.new-features.php>`_
    to include the extra parameters necessary to `encrypt <http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-encrypt.php>`_
    and `decrypt <http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-decrypt.php>`_
    using OpenSSL for GCM encryption. For PHP versions 7.0 and earlier, a polyfill
    for GCM support is provided and used by the encryption clients
    ``S3EncryptionClientV2`` and ``S3EncryptionMultipartUploaderV2``.
    However, the performance for large inputs will be much slower using the polyfill
    than using the native implementation for PHP 7.1+, so upgrading older PHP
    version environments may be necessary to use them effectively.

``'KeySize'`` (int)
    The length of the content encryption key to generate for
    encrypting. Defaults to 256 bits. Valid configuration options are 256 and
    128 bits.

``'Aad'`` (string)
    Optional 'Additional authentication data' to include with your
    encrypted payload. This information is validated on decryption. ``Aad`` is
    available only when using the 'gcm' cipher.

.. important::

    Additional authentication data is not supported by all AWS SDKs and as such
    other SDKs may not be able to decrypt files encrypted using this parameter.

Metadata Strategies
===================

You also have the option of providing an instance of a class that implements
the ``Aws\Crypto\MetadataStrategyInterface``. This simple interface handles
saving and loading the ``Aws\Crypto\MetadataEnvelope`` that contains your
envelope encryption materials. The SDK provides two classes that implement
this: ``Aws\S3\Crypto\HeadersMetadataStrategy`` and
``Aws\S3\Crypto\InstructionFileMetadataStrategy``. ``HeadersMetadataStrategy``
is used by default.

.. code-block:: php

    $strategy = new InstructionFileMetadataStrategy(
        $s3Client
    );

    $encryptionClient->putObject([
        '@MaterialsProvider' => $materialsProvider,
        '@MetadataStrategy' => $strategy,
        '@KmsEncryptionContext' => [],
        '@CipherOptions' => $cipherOptions,
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key' => $key,
        'Body' => fopen('file-to-encrypt.txt', 'r'),
    ]);

    $result = $encryptionClient->getObject([
        '@KmsAllowDecryptWithAnyCmk' => false,
        '@MaterialsProvider' => $materialsProvider,
        '@SecurityProfile' => 'V2',
        '@MetadataStrategy' => $strategy,
        '@CipherOptions' => $cipherOptions,
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key' => $key,
    ]);

Class name constants for the ``HeadersMetadataStrategy`` and
``InstructionFileMetadataStrategy`` can also be supplied by invoking
`::class`.

.. code-block:: php

    $result = $encryptionClient->putObject([
        '@MaterialsProvider' => $materialsProvider,
        '@MetadataStrategy' => HeadersMetadataStrategy::class,
        '@CipherOptions' => $cipherOptions,
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key' => $key,
        'Body' => fopen('file-to-encrypt.txt', 'r'),
    ]);

.. note::

    If there is a failure after an instruction file is uploaded, it will
    not be automatically deleted.

Multipart Uploads
=================

Performing a multipart upload with client-side encryption is also possible. The
``Aws\S3\Crypto\S3EncryptionMultipartUploaderV2`` prepares the source stream
for encryption before uploading. Creating one takes on a similar experience to
using the ``Aws\S3\MultipartUploader`` and the ``Aws\S3\Crypto\S3EncryptionClientV2``.
The ``S3EncryptionMultipartUploaderV2`` can handle the same ``'@MetadataStrategy'``
option as the ``S3EncryptionClientV2``, as well as all available ``'@CipherOptions'``
configurations.

.. code-block:: php

    $kmsKeyId = 'kms-key-id';
    $materialsProvider = new KmsMaterialsProviderV2(
        new KmsClient([
            'region' => 'us-east-1',
            'version' => 'latest',
            'profile' => 'default',
        ]),
        $kmsKeyId
    );

    $bucket = 'the-bucket-name';
    $key = 'the-upload-key';
    $cipherOptions = [
        'Cipher' => 'gcm'
        'KeySize' => 256,
        // Additional configuration options
    ];

    $multipartUploader = new S3EncryptionMultipartUploaderV2(
        new S3Client([
            'region' => 'us-east-1',
            'version' => 'latest',
            'profile' => 'default',
        ]),
        fopen('large-file-to-encrypt.txt', 'r'),
        [
            '@MaterialsProvider' => $materialsProvider,
            '@CipherOptions' => $cipherOptions,
            'bucket' => $bucket,
            'key' => $key,
        ]
    );
    $multipartUploader->upload();

.. note::

    In addition to the |S3| and |KMS|-based service errors, you might
    receive thrown ``InvalidArgumentException`` objects if your
    ``'@CipherOptions'`` are not correctly configured.
