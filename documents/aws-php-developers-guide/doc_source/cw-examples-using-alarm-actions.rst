   :keywords: Amazon CloudWatch code examples for PHP

Use alarm actions to create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your |EC2| instances. You can use the stop or terminate actions when you no longer need an instance to be running. You can use the reboot and recover actions to automatically reboot those instances.

The following examples show how to:

* Enable actions for specified alarms using :aws-php-class:`EnableAlarmActions <api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#enablealarmactions>`.
* Disable actions for specified alarms using :aws-php-class:`DisableAlarmActions <api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#disablealarmactions>`.
