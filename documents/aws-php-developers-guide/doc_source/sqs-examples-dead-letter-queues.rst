   :keywords: Amazon SQS code examples for PHP

A dead-letter queue is one that other (source) queues can target for messages that can't be processed successfully. You can set aside and isolate these messages
in the dead-letter queue to determine why their processing did not succeed. You must individually configure each source queue that sends messages to a dead-letter
queue. Multiple queues can target a single dead-letter queue.

To learn more, see :SQS-dg:`Using SQS Dead Letter Queues <sqs-dead-letter-queues>`.

The following example shows how to:

* Enable a dead-letter queue using :aws-php-class:`SetQueueAttributes <api-sqs-2012-11-05.html#setqueueattributes>`.
