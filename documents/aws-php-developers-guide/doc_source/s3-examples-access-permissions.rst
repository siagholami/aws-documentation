   :description: Get access control lists (ACLs) and set permissions for Amazon S3 buckets using the AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
   :keywords: Amazon S3 code examples for PHP

Access control lists (ACLs) are one of the resource-based access policy options you can use to manage access to your buckets and objects.
You can use ACLs to grant basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts. To learn more, see `Managing Access with ACLs <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`_.


The following example shows how to:

* Get the access control policy for a bucket using :aws-php-class:`GetBucketAcl <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#getbucketacl>`.
* Set the permissions on a bucket using ACLs, using :aws-php-class:`PutBucketAcl <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#putbucketacl>`.
