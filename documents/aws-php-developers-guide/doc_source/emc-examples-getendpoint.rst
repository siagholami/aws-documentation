##############################################################################

.. meta::
   :description: Example that shows how to get the account-specific endpoint for use with AWS Elemental MediaConvert. using the AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
   :keywords: AWS Elemental MediaConvert Examples

In this example, you use the |sdk-php| Version 3 to call |EMClong| and retrieve your account-specific endpoint. You can retrieve your endpoint 
URL from the service default endpoint and so do not yet need your acccount-specific endpoint. 

The following examples show how to:

* Retrieve your account-specific endpoint. using :aws-php-class:`DescribeEndpoints <api-mediaconvert-2017-08-29.html#describeendpoints>`.

.. include:: text/git-php-examples.txt

To access the |EMC| client, create an |IAM| role that gives |EMClong| access to your input files and the |S3| buckets where your output files are 
stored. For details, see :EMC-ug:`Set Up IAM Permissions <iam-role>` in the |EMC-ug|_.

Retrieve Endpoints
==================

Create an object to pass the empty request parameters for the describeEndpoints method of the ``AWS.MediaConvert`` client class. To call the 
describeEndpoints method, create a promise for invoking an |EMClong| service object, passing the parameters. Handle the response in the promise callback.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: mediaconvert.php.get_endpoint.import.txt
   :language: PHP


**Sample Code**

Define the region in which to get the endpoint, and create an |EMC| client object:

.. literalinclude:: mediaconvert.php.get_endpoint.region.txt
   :language: PHP
   

Call the describeEndpoints method to retrieve the endpoints and save the endpoint's URL:

.. literalinclude:: mediaconvert.php.get_endpoint.main.txt
   :language: PHP
