|SDKM| in the |sdk-php| Version 3
#################################

|SDKMlong| (|SDKM|\) enables enterprise customers to collect metrics from AWS SDKs on their hosts and clients shared with 
AWS Enterprise Support. SDK Metrics provides information that helps speed up detection and diagnosis of issues occurring in connections 
to AWS services for AWS Enterprise Support customers. 

As telemetry is collected on each host, it is relayed via UDP to localhost, where the |CW| agent aggregates the data and sends it 
to the |SDKM| service. Therefore, to receive metrics, you must add the |CW| agent to your instance.

Learn more about 
:CW-dg:`SDK Metrics <CloudWatch-Agent-SDK-Metrics>` in the |CW-dg|.

Each of the following topics describes how to set up, configure, and manage |SDKM| for the |sdk-php|.
