Metrics are data about the performance of your systems. You can enable detailed monitoring of some resources,
such as your |EC2| instances, or of your own application metrics.

The following examples show how to:

* List metrics using :aws-php-class:`ListMetrics <api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#listmetrics>`.
* Retrieve alarms for a metric using :aws-php-class:`DescribeAlarmsForMetric <api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#describealarmsformetric>`.
* Get statistics for a specified metric using :aws-php-class:`GetMetricStatistics <api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#getmetricstatistics>`.
