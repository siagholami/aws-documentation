Using |AC9long| with the |sdk-php| Version 3
============================================

        Describes how to use AWS Cloud9 with the AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
	:keywords: 	AWS Cloud9, AWS SDK for PHP version 3 examples,

You can use |AC9long| with the |sdk-php| Version 3 to write, run, and debug your PHP code using just a browser. |AC9| includes tools such as a
code editor, debugger, and terminal. Because the |AC9| IDE is cloud based, you can work on your projects from your office, home,
or anywhere using an internet-connected machine. For general information about |AC9|, see the |AC9-ug|_.

Follow these instructions to set up |AC9| with the |sdk-php|:

* :ref:`cloud9-php-account`
* :ref:`cloud9-php-environment`
* :ref:`cloud9-php-sdk`
* :ref:`cloud9-php-examples`
* :ref:`cloud9-php-run`

.. _cloud9-php-account:

Step 1: Set up Your AWS Account to Use |AC9|
============================================

Start to use |AC9| by signing in to the |AC9| console as an |IAMlong| (|IAM|) entity (for example, an |IAM| user) in your AWS account who
has access permissions for |AC9|.

To set up an |IAM| entity in your AWS account to access |AC9|, and to sign in to the |AC9| console, see
:AC9-ug:`Team Setup for AWS Cloud9 <setup>` in the |AC9-ug|_.

.. _cloud9-php-environment:

Step 2: Set up Your |AC9| Development Environment
=================================================

After you sign in to the |AC9| console, use the console to create an |AC9| development environment.
After you create the environment, |AC9| opens the IDE for that environment.

See :AC9-ug:`Creating an Environment in AWS Cloud9 <create-environment>` in the |AC9-ug|_ for details.

.. note::

      As you create your environment in the console for the first time, we recommend that you choose the option
      to :guilabel:`Create a new instance for environment (EC2)`.
      This option tells |AC9| to create an environment, launch an |EC2| instance, and then connect the new
      instance to the new environment. This is the fastest way to begin using |AC9|.

.. _cloud9-php-sdk:

Step 3: Set up the |sdk-php|
============================

After |AC9| opens the IDE for your development environment, use the IDE to set up the |sdk-php| in your environment, as follows.

#. If the terminal isn't already open in the IDE, open it. On the menu bar in the IDE, choose :guilabel:`Window, New Terminal`.
#. Run the following commands to install the |sdk-php|.

   .. code-block:: sh

      curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
      php composer.phar require aws/aws-sdk-php

If the IDE can't find PHP, run the following command to install it. (This command assumes you
chose the option to :guilabel:`Create a new instance for environment (EC2)`, earlier in this topic.)

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo yum -y install php56

.. _cloud9-php-examples:

Step 4: Download Example Code
=============================

Use the terminal you opened in the previous step to download example code for the |sdk-php| into the |AC9| development environment.

To do this, run the following command. This command downloads a copy of all of the code examples
used in the official AWS SDK documentation into your environment's root directory.

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples.git

To find code examples for the |sdk-php|, use the :guilabel:`Environment` window to open the
:file:`ENVIRONMENT_NAME\aws-doc-sdk-examples\php\example_code` directory,
where :file:`ENVIRONMENT_NAME` is the name of your development environment.

To learn how to work with these and other code examples, see :doc:`Code Examples <examples_index>`.

.. _cloud9-php-run:

Step 5: Run and Debug Example Code
==================================

To run code in your |AC9| development environment, see
:AC9-ug:`Run Your Code <build-run-debug>` in the |AC9-ug|_.

To debug code, see
:AC9-ug:`Debug Your Code <build-run-debug>` in the |AC9-ug|_.
