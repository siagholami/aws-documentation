|AKSlong| allows you to send real-time data. Create a data producer with |AKS|
that delivers data to the configured destination every time you add data.

For more information, see  :AKS-dg:`Creating and Managing Streams
<working-with-streams.html>` in the |AKS-dg|.

The following examples show how to:

* Create a data stream using :aws-php-class:`CreateAlias <api-kinesis-1913-12-02.html#createstream>`.
* Get details about a single data stream using :aws-php-class:`DescribeStream <api-kinesis-1913-12-02.html#describestream>`.
* List existing data streams using :aws-php-class:`ListStreams <api-kinesis-1913-12-02.html#liststreams>`.
* Send data to an existing data stream using :aws-php-class:`PutRecord <api-kinesis-1913-12-02.html#putrecord>`.
* Delete a data stream using :aws-php-class:`DeleteStream <api-kinesis-1913-12-02.html#deletestream>`.

Create a Data Stream Using a |AK| Data Stream
=============================================

Establish a |AK| data stream where you can send information to be processed by |AK| using the following code example. Learn more about
:AKS-dg:`Creating and Updating Data Streams <amazon-kinesis-streams>` in the |AKS-dg|.

To create a |AK| data stream, use the :AKS-api:`CreateStream <API_CreateStream>` operation.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.php.create_data_stream.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.php.create_data_stream.main.txt
   :language: PHP   
   

Retrieve a Data Stream
======================

Get details about an existing data stream using the following code example. By default, this returns information about the first 10 shards connected to the specified |AK| data stream. Remember to check :code:`StreamStatus` from the response before writing data to a |AK| data stream.

To retrieve details about a specified |AK| data stream, use the :AKS-api:`DescribeStream <API_DescribeStream>` operation.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.php.describe_data_stream.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.php.describe_data_stream.main.txt
   :language: PHP


List Existing Data Streams That Are Connected to |AK|
=====================================================

List the first 10 data streams from your AWS account in the selected AWS Region. Use the returned ```HasMoreStreams`` to determine if there are more streams associated with your account.

To list your |AK| data streams, use the :AKS-api:`ListStreams <API_ListStreams>` operation.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.php.list_data_stream.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.php.list_data_stream.main.txt
   :language: PHP



Send Data to an Existing Data Stream
====================================

Once you create a data stream, use the following example to send data.
Before sending data to it, use ``DescribeStream`` to check whether the data :code:`StreamStatus` is active.

To write a single data record to a |AK| data stream, use the :AKS-api:`PutRecord <API_PutRecord>` operation. To write up to 500 records into a |AK| data stream, use the :AKS-api:`PutRecords <API_PutRecords>` operation.


**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.php.put_data_stream_record.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: kinesis.php.put_data_stream_record.main.txt
   :language: PHP


Delete a Data Stream
====================

This example demonstrates how to delete a data stream. Deleting a data stream also deletes any data you sent to the data stream. Active |AK| data streams switch to the DELETING state until the stream deletion is complete. While in the DELETING state, the stream continues to process data.

To delete a |AK| data stream, use the :AKS-api:`DeleteStream <API_DeleteStream>` operation.
