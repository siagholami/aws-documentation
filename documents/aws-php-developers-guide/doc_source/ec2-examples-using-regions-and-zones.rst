with multiple isolated locations known as Availability Zones. |EC2| provides the ability to place instances and data in multiple locations.

The following examples show how to:

* Describe the Availability Zones that are available to you using :aws-php-class:`DescribeAvailabilityZones <api-ec2-2016-11-15.html#describeavailabilityzones>`.
