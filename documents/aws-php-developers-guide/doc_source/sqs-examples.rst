|SQSlong| (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully managed message queuing service. |SQS| lets you decouple the components of a cloud application. |SQS|
includes standard queues with high throughput and at-least-once processing, and FIFO queues that provide FIFO (first>-in, first>-out) delivery and exactly-once processing.
