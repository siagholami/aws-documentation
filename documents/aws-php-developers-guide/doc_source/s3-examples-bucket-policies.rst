   :keywords: Amazon S3 code examples for PHP

You can use a bucket policy to grant permission to your |S3| resources. To learn more, see `Using Bucket Policies and User Policies <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html>`_.

The following example shows how to:

* Return the policy for a specified bucket using :aws-php-class:`GetBucketPolicy <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#getbucketpolicy>`.
* Replace a policy on a bucket using :aws-php-class:`PutBucketPolicy <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#putbucketpolicy>`.
* Delete a policy from a bucket using :aws-php-class:`DeleteBucketPolicy <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#deletebucketpolicy>`.
