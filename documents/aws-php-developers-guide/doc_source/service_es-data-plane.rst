Signing an |ESlong| Search Request with |sdk-php| Version 3

   :description: Sign and use Amazon Elasticsearch Service with the AWS SDK for PHP.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for PHP Elasticsearch, Amazon Elasticsearch Service for PHP

|ESlong| (|ES|) is a managed service that makes it easy
to deploy, operate, and scale |ESlong|, a popular open-source search, and
analytics engine. |ES| offers direct access to the |ESlong| API. This
means that developers can use the tools with which theyâ€™re familiar, as well
as robust security options, such as using |IAM| users and roles for access
control. Many |ESlong| clients support request signing, but if you're using
a client that doesn't, you can sign arbitrary PSR-7 requests with the
built-in credential providers and signers of the |sdk-php|.

The following examples show how to:

* Sign a request with the AWS signing protocol using :aws-php-class:`SignatureV4 <class-Aws.Signature.SignatureV4.html#_signRequest>`.

Signing an |ES| Request
=======================

|ES| uses :AWS-gr:`Signature Version 4 <signature-version-4>`.
This means that you need to sign requests against the service's signing
name (``es``, in this case) and the AWS Region of your |ES| domain. A full list
of Regions supported by |ES| can be found :AWS-gr:`on the AWS Regions and Endpoints
page <rande>` in the |AWS-gr|.
However, in this example, we sign requests against an |ES| domain in the
``us-west-2`` region.

You need to provide credentials, which you can do either with the SDK's
default provider chain or with any form of credentials described in
:doc:`guide_credentials`. You'll also need a :aws-php-class:`PSR-7 request
<class-Psr.Http.Message.RequestInterface.html>` (assumed in the code below to be named ``$psr7Request``).

.. code-block:: php

    // Pull credentials from the default provider chain
    $provider = Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::defaultProvider();
    $credentials = call_user_func($provider)->wait();

    // Create a signer with the service's signing name and Region
    $signer = new Aws\Signature\SignatureV4('es', 'us-west-2');

    // Sign your request
    $signedRequest = $signer->signRequest($psr7Request, $credentials);
