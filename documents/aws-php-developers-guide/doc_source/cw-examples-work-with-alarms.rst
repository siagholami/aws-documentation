   :description: Create Amazon CloudWatch alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover Amazon EC2 instances using the AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
   :keywords: Amazon CloudWatch code examples for PHP

An |CWlong| alarm watches a single metric over a time period you specify. It performs one or more actions based on the value of
the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods.

The following examples show how to:

* Describe an alarm using :aws-php-class:`DescribeAlarms <api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#describealarms>`.
* Create an alarm using :aws-php-class:`PutMetricAlarm <api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#putmetricalarm>`.
* Delete an alarm using :aws-php-class:`DeleteAlarms <api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#deletealarms>`.
