In some cases, you might want to create a client that is not associated with any
credentials. This enables you to make anonymous requests to a service.

For example, you can configure both |S3| objects and |CSLong| domains to allow
anonymous access.

To create an anonymous client, you set the ``'credentials'`` option to
``false``.

.. code-block:: php

    $s3Client = new S3Client([
        'version'     => 'latest',
        'region'      => 'us-west-2',
        'credentials' => false
    ]);

    // Makes an anonymous request. The object would need to be publicly
    // readable for this to succeed.
    $result = $s3Client->getObject([
        'Bucket' => 'my-bucket',
        'Key'    => 'my-key',
    ]);
