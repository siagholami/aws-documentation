   :description: Use the AWS KMS API to view and change the key policies of AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs).
   :keywords: AWS KMS code examples for PHP, PHP key polices

When you create an |KMSlong| (|KMS|) :KMS-dg:`customer master key (CMK)<concepts.html#master_keys>`, you determine who can use and manage that CMK. These permissions are contained in a document called the key policy. You can use the key policy to add, remove, or modify permissions at any time for a customer-managed CMK, but you cannot edit the key policy for a CMK that's managed by AWS. For more information, see :KMS-dg:`Authentication and Access Control for AWS KMS<control-access>`.

The following examples show how to:

* List the names of key policies using :aws-php-class:`ListKeyPolicies <api-kms-2014-11-01.html#listkeypolicies>`.
* Get a key policy using :aws-php-class:`GetKeyPolicy <api-kms-2014-11-01.html#getkeypolicy>`.
* Set a key policy using :aws-php-class:`PutKeyPolicy <api-kms-2014-11-01.html#putkeypolicy>`.

List All Key Policies
=====================

To get the names of key policies for a CMK, use the :code:`ListKeyPolicies` operation. The only key policy name it returns is the default name.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  kms.php.list_key_policies.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: kms.php.list_key_policies.main.txt
   :language: PHP

Retrieve a Key Policy
=====================

To get the key policy for a CMK, use the :code:`GetKeyPolicy` operation.

:code:`GetKeyPolicy` requires a policy name. Unless you created a key policy when you created the CMK, the only valid policy name is the default. Learn more about the :KMS-dg:`default key policy<key-policies.html#key-policy-default>`.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  kms.php.get_key_policies.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: kms.php.get_key_policies.main.txt
   :language: PHP

Set a Key Policy
================

To establish or change a key policy for a CMK, use the :code:`PutKeyPolicy` operation.

:code:`PutKeyPolicy` requires a policy name. Unless you created a Key Policy when you created the CMK, the only valid policy name is the default. Learn more about the :KMS-dg:`Default Key Policy<key-policies.html#key-policy-default>`.
