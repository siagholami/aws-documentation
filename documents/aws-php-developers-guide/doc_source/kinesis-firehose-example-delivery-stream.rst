   :keywords: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose for PHP, delivery streams for PHP, data streams for PHP

|AKFlong| enables you to send real-time data to other AWS services including |AKSlong|, |S3|, |ESlong| (|ES|), and |RS|, or to Splunk. Create a data producer with delivery streams
to deliver data to the configured destination every time you add data.

The following examples show how to:

* Create a delivery stream using :aws-php-class:`CreateDeliveryStream <api-firehose-2015-08-04.html#createdeliverystream>`.
* Get details about a single delivery stream using :aws-php-class:`DescribeDeliveryStream <api-firehose-2015-08-04.html#describedeliverystream>`.
* List your delivery streams using :aws-php-class:`ListDeliveryStreams <api-firehose-2015-08-04.html#listdeliverystreams>`.
* Send data to a delivery stream using :aws-php-class:`PutRecord <api-firehose-2015-08-04.html#putrecord>`.
* Delete a delivery stream using :aws-php-class:`DeleteDeliveryStream <api-firehose-2015-08-04.html#deletedeliverystream>`.

For more information about using |AKFlong|, see the |AKF-dg|_.

Create a Delivery Stream Using a |AK| Data Stream
=================================================

To establish a delivery stream that puts data into an existing |AK| data stream,
use the :AKF-api:`CreateDeliveryStream <API_CreateDeliveryStream>` operation.

This enables developers to migrate existing |AK| services to |AKF|.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.create_delivery_stream.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.create_delivery_stream.main.txt
   :language: PHP

Create a Delivery Stream Using an |S3| Bucket
=============================================

To establish a delivery stream that puts data into an existing |S3| bucket,
use the :AKF-api:`CreateDeliveryStream <API_CreateDeliveryStream>` operation.

Provide the destination parameters,
as described in :AKF-dg:`Destination Parameters <create-destination>`. Then ensure that you grant |AKF| access to your |S3| bucket,
as described in :AKF-dg:`Grant Kinesis Data Firehose Access to an Amazon S3 Destination <controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3>`.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.create_s3_delivery_stream.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.create_s3_delivery_stream.main.txt
   :language: PHP


Create a Delivery Stream Using |ES|
===================================

To establish a |AKF| delivery stream that puts data into an |ES| cluster,
use the :AKF-api:`CreateDeliveryStream <API_CreateDeliveryStream>` operation.

Provide the destination parameters, as described in
:AKF-dg:`Destination Parameters <create-destination>`. Ensure that you grant |AKF| access to your |ES| cluster, as described in
:AKF-dg:`Grant Kinesis Data Firehose Access to an Amazon ES Destination <controlling-access.html#using-iam-es>`.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.create_es_delivery_stream.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.create_es_delivery_stream.main.txt
   :language: PHP



Retrieve a Delivery Stream
==========================

To get the details about an existing |AKF| delivery stream,
use the :AKF-api:`DescribeDeliveryStream <API_DescribeDeliveryStream>` operation.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.describe_delivery_stream.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.describe_delivery_stream.main.txt
   :language: PHP

List Existing Delivery Streams Connected to |AKS|
=================================================

To list all the existing |AKF| delivery streams sending data to |AKS|,
use the :AKF-api:`ListDeliveryStreams <API_ListDeliveryStreams>` operation.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.list_kinesis_delivery_stream.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.list_kinesis_delivery_stream.main.txt
   :language: PHP

List Existing Delivery Streams Sending Data to Other |AWS| Services
===================================================================

To list all the existing |AKF| delivery streams sending data to |S3|, |ES|, or |RS|, or to Splunk,
use the :AKF-api:`ListDeliveryStreams <API_ListDeliveryStreams>` operation.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.list_direct_delivery_stream.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.list_direct_delivery_stream.main.txt
   :language: PHP


Send Data to an Existing |AKF| Delivery Stream
==============================================

To send data through a |AKF| delivery stream to your specified destination,
use the :AKF-api:`PutRecord <API_API_PutRecord>` operation after you create a |AKF| delivery stream.

Before sending data to a |AKF| delivery stream, use ``DescribeDeliveryStream`` to see if the delivery stream is active.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.put_record_delivery_stream.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.put_record_delivery_stream.main.txt
   :language: PHP

Delete a |AKF| Delivery Stream
==============================

To delete a |AKF| delivery stream,
use the :AKF-api:`DeleteDeliveryStreams <API_DeleteDeliveryStreams>` operation.
This also deletes any data you have sent to the delivery stream.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.delete_delivery_stream.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: firehose.php.delete_delivery_stream.main.txt
   :language: PHP
