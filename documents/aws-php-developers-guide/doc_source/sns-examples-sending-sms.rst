   :description: Get and set SMS messaging preferences, check a phone number, and get a list of phone numbers for Amazon SNS using the AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
   :keywords: Amazon SNS code examples for PHP, Amazon SNS for PHP, send SMS messages with Simple Notification Service

You can use |SNSlong| (|SNS|) to send text messages, or SMS messages, to SMS-enabled devices. You can send a message directly to a phone number, or you can send a message to multiple phone numbers at once by subscribing those phone numbers to a topic and sending your message to the topic.

Use |SNS| to specify preferences for SMS messaging, such as how your deliveries are optimized (for cost or for reliable delivery), your monthly spending limit, how message deliveries are logged, and whether to subscribe to daily SMS usage reports. These preferences are retrieved and set as SMS attributes for |SNS|.

When you send an SMS message, specify the phone number using the E.164 format. E.164 is a standard for the phone number structure used for international telecommunications. Phone numbers that follow this format can have a maximum of 15 digits, and are prefixed with the plus character (+) and the country code. For example, a US phone number in E.164 format would appear as +1001XXX5550100.

The following examples show how to:

* Retrieve the default settings for sending SMS messages from your account using :aws-php-class:`GetSMSAttributes <api-sns-2010-03-31.html#getsmsattributes>`.
* Update the default settings for sending SMS messages from your account using :aws-php-class:`SetSMSAttributes <api-sns-2010-03-31.html#setsmsattributes>`.
* Discover if a given phone number owner has opted out of receiving SMS messages from your account using :aws-php-class:`CheckIfPhoneNumberISOptedOut <api-sns-2010-03-31.html#checkifphonenumberisoptedout>`.
* List phone numbers where the owner has opted out of receiving SMS messages from your account  using :aws-php-class:`ListPhoneNumberOptedOut <api-sns-2010-03-31.html#listphonenumbersoptedout>`.
* Send a text message (SMS message) directly to a phone number using :aws-php-class:`Publish <api-sns-2010-03-31.html#publish>`.

Get SMS Attributes
==================

To retrieve the default settings for SMS messages, use the :SNS-api:`GetSMSAttributes <API_GetSMSAttributes>` operation.

This example gets the :code:`DefaultSMSType` attribute. This attribute controls whether SMS messages are sent as :code:`Promotional`, which optimizes message delivery to incur the lowest cost, or as :code:`Transactional`, which optimizes message delivery to achieve the highest reliability.

Set SMS Attributes
==================

To update the default settings for SMS messages, use the :SNS-api:`SetSMSAttributes <API_SetSMSAttributes>` operation.

This example sets the :code:`DefaultSMSType` attribute to :code:`Transactional`, which optimizes message delivery to achieve the highest reliability.
