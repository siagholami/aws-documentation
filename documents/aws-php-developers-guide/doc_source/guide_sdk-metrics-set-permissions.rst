   :description: Set IAM Policy for AWS SDK Metrics for Enterprise Support with the AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for PHP version 3, AWS SDK Metrics for Enterprise Support with PHP, use php to monitor AWS Services


To collect metrics from AWS SDKs using |SDKMlong| Enterprise customers must create an |IAM| Role that gives |CW| agent
permission to gather data from their |EC2| instance or production environment.  

Use the following PHP code sample or the AWS Console to create an |IAM| Policy and Role for an |CW| agent to access |SDKM| in your environment.

Learn more about using |SDKM| with |sdk-php| in :doc:`guide_sdk-metrics-configure`. 
For more information about |SDKM| see :CW-dg:`IAM Permissions for SDK Metrics <Set-IAM-Permissions-For-SDK-Metrics>` in the |CW-dg|.

Set Up Access Permissions Using the |sdk-php|
=============================================

Create an IAM role for the instance that has permission for |SSMlong| and |SDKM|.

First, create a policy using :aws-php-class:`CreatePolicy <api-iam-2010-05-08.html#createpolicy>`.
Then create a role using :aws-php-class:`CreateRole  <api-iam-2010-05-08.html#createrole>`.
Finally, attach the policy you created to your new role with
:aws-php-class:`AttachRolePolicy <api-iam-2010-05-08.html#attachrolepolicy>`.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: iam.php.create_role.import.txt
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: iam.php.create_role.main.txt
   :language: PHP


Set Up Access Permissions by Using the |IAM| Console
====================================================

Alternatively, you can use the |IAM| console to create a role.
