Enabling Amazon Detective
You can enable Detective from the Detective console, the Detective API, or the AWS Command Line Interface.
You can only enable Detective once in each Region. If you are already a master account for a behavior graph in a Region, then you cannot enable Detective again in that Region.
Before you try to enable Detective, make sure that your account has been enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty for at least 48 hours. If you do not meet this requirement, you cannot enable Detective.
If you do meet the GuardDuty requirement, then when you make the request to enable Detective, Detective checks whether your data volume is within the Detective quota. If your data volume exceeds the quota, then you cannot enable Detective.

Enabling Detective across Regions (Python script on GitHub)
Detective provides an open-source script in GitHub that does the following:
 Enables Detective for a master account in a specified list of Regions
 Adds a provided list of member accounts to add to each of the resulting behavior graphs
 Sends invitation emails to the member accounts
 Automatically accepts the invitations for the member accounts
For information on how to configure and use the GitHub scripts, see Using the Amazon Detective Python scripts.
Checking that data is being extracted
After you enable Detective, it begins to ingest and extract data from your AWS account into your behavior graph.
For the initial extraction, data usually becomes available in the behavior graph within 24 hours.
One way to check that Detective is extracting data is to look for example values on the Detective Search page.
To check for example values on the Search page


Open the Detective console.


In the navigation pane, choose Search.


From the Select type menu, choose a type of item.


Examples from your data contains a sample set of identifiers of the selected type that are in your behavior graph data.
If you can see example values, then you know that data is being ingested and extracted into your behavior graph.
