Using the Amazon Detective Python scripts
Amazon Detective provides a set of open-source Python scripts in the GitHub repository amazon-detective-multiaccount-scripts. The scripts require Python 3.
You can use these to perform the following tasks:
 Enable Detective for a master account across Regions.
 Add member accounts to a master account's behavior graphs across Regions.
 Remove member accounts from a master account's behavior graphs across Regions.
 Disable Detective for a master account across Regions. When a master account disables Detective, the master account's behavior graph in each Region is disabled.
Overview of the enableDetective.py script
The enableDetective.py script does the following:


Enables Detective in for a master account in each specified Region, if the master account does not already have Detective enabled in that Region.


Sends invitations from the master account to the specified member accounts for each behavior graph.


The invitation email messages use the default message content and cannot be customized.

Automatically accepts the invitations for the member accounts.

Because the script automatically accepts the invitations, member accounts can ignore these messages.
We recommend reaching out directly to the member accounts to notify them that the invitations are accepted automatically.
Overview of the disableDetective.py script
The disableDetective.py script deletes the specified member accounts from the master account's behavior graphs across the specified Regions.
It also provides an option to disable Detective for the master account across the specified Regions.
Required permissions for the scripts
The scripts require a preexisting AWS role in the master account and in all of the member accounts that you add or remove.
The role name must be the same in all of the accounts.
The role trust relationship must allow your instance or local credentials to assume the role.
The AmazonDetectiveFullAccess managed policy shown below contains the permissions that are required for the script to succeed.
Role policy
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "detective:CreateMembers",
                "detective:DeleteMembers",
                "detective:AcceptInvitation",
                "guardduty:ArchiveFindings",
                "guardduty:ListDetectors"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
Role trust relationship
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNTID>:user/<USERNAME>"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
If you do not have a common role that includes at least the above permissions, you must create a role with at least those permissions in each member account and in the master account.
When you create the role, make sure that you do the following:
 Use the same role name in every account.
 Select the AmazonDetectiveFullAccess managed policy.
To automate this process, you can use the EnableDetective.yaml AWS CloudFormation template. Because the template creates only global resources, it can be run in any Region.
Setting up the execution environment for the Python scripts
You can run the scripts from either an EC2 instance or from a local machine.
Launching and configuring an EC2 instance
One option for running the scripts is to run them from an EC2 instance.
To launch and configure an EC2 instance


Launch an EC2 instance in your master account. For details on how to launch an EC2 instance, see Getting Started with Amazon EC2 Linux Instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.


Attach to the instance an IAM role that has permissions to allow the instance to call AssumeRole within the master account.


If you used the EnableDetective.yaml AWS CloudFormation template, then an instance role with a profile named EnableDetective was created.
Otherwise, for information on creating an instance role, see the blog post Easily Replace or Attach an IAM Role to an Existing EC2 Instance by Using the EC2 Console.


Install the required software:
    APT: sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip python3 git
    RPM: sudo yum -y install python3-pip python3 git
    Boto (minimum version 1.15): sudo pip install boto3


Clone the repository to the EC2 instance.


git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-detective-multiaccount-scripts.git
Configuring a local machine to run the scripts
You can also run the scripts from your local machine.
To configure a local machine to run the scripts


Make sure that you have set up on your local machine credentials for your master account that have permission to call AssumeRole.


Install the required software:
    Python 3
    Boto (minimum version 1.15)
    GitHub scripts  
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Creating a .csv list of member accounts to add or remove
To identify the member accounts to add to or remove from the behavior graphs, you provide a .csv file that contains the list of accounts.
List each account on a separate line. Each member account entry contains the AWS account ID and the account's root user email address.
See the following example:
111122223333,srodriguez@example.com
444455556666,rroe@example.com
Running enableDetective.py
You can run the enableDetective.py script from an EC2 instance or your local machine.
To run enableDetective.py


Copy the .csv file to the amazon-detective-multiaccount-scripts directory on your EC2 instance or local machine.


Change to the amazon-detective-multiaccount-scripts directory.


Run the enableDetective.py script.


enableDetective.py --master_account masterAccountID --assume_role roleName inputFileName --enabled_regions regionList
When you run the script, replace the following values:
masterAccountID
The AWS account ID for the master account.
roleName
The name of the AWS role to assume in the master account and each member account.
inputFileName
The name of the .csv file containing the list of member accounts to add to the master account's behavior graphs.
regionList
(Optional) A comma-separated list of Regions in which to add the member accounts to the master account's behavior graph. For example:  
--enabled_regions us-east-1,us-east-2,us-west-2
The master account might not already have Detective enabled in a Region. In that case, the script enables Detective and creates a new behavior graph for the master account.
If you do not provide a list of Regions, then the script acts across all Regions that Detective supports.
Running disableDetective.py
You can run the disableDetective.py script from an EC2 instance or your local machine.
To run disableDetective.py


Copy the .csv file to the amazon-detective-multiaccount-scripts directory.


To use the .csv file to delete the listed member accounts from the master account's behavior graphs across a specified list of Regions, run the disableDetective.py script as follows:


disabledetective.py --master_account masterAccountID --assume_role roleName inputFileName --disabled_regions regionList

To disable Detective for the master account across all Regions, run the disableDetective.py script with the --delete-master flag.

disabledetective.py --master_account masterAccountID --assume_role roleName inputFileName --disabled_regions regionList --delete_master
When you run the script, replace the following values:
masterAccountID
The AWS account ID for the master account.
roleName
The name of the AWS role to assume in the master account and each member account.
inputFileName
The name of the .csv file containing the list of member accounts to remove from the master account's behavior graphs.
You must provide a .csv file even if you are disabling Detective.
regionList
(Optional) A comma-separated list of Regions in which to do one of the following:
 Remove the member accounts from the master account's behavior graphs.
 If the --delete-master flag is included, disable Detective.
For example:  
--disabled_regions us-east-1,us-east-2,us-west-2
If you do not provide a list of Regions, then the script acts across all Regions that Detective supports.
