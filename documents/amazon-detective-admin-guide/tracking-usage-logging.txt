Tracking actions and usage in Amazon Detective
To help you to track your Detective activity, the Usage page shows the amount of data ingested and the projected cost.
 For master accounts, the Usage page shows the data volume and projected cost across the entire behavior graph.
 For member accounts, the Usage page shows the data volume and projected cost for their account across the behavior graphs that they contribute to.
Detective also supports AWS CloudTrail logging.
