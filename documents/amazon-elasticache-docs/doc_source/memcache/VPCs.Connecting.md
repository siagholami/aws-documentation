# Connecting to a Cache Cluster Running in an Amazon VPC<a name="VPCs.Connecting"></a>

This example shows how to launch an Amazon EC2 instance in your Amazon VPC\. You can then log in to this instance and access the ElastiCache cluster that is running in the Amazon VPC\.

## Connecting to a Cache Cluster Running in an Amazon VPC \(Console\)<a name="VPCs.Connecting.CON"></a>

In this example, you create an Amazon EC2 instance in your Amazon VPC\. You can use this Amazon EC2 instance to connect to cache nodes running in the Amazon VPC\.

**Note**  
For information about using Amazon EC2, see the [Amazon EC2 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/) in the [Amazon EC2 documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2/)\.

**To create an Amazon EC2 instance in your Amazon VPC using the Amazon EC2 console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the console, choose **Launch Instance** and follow these steps:

1. On the **Choose an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\)** page, choose the 64\-bit Amazon Linux AMI, and then choose **Select**\.

1. On the **Choose an Instance Type** page, choose **3\. Configure Instance**\.

1. On the **Configure Instance Details** page, make the following selections:

   1. In the **Network** list, choose your Amazon VPC\.

   1. In the **Subnet** list, choose your public subnet\.

   When the settings are as you want them, choose **4\. Add Storage**\.

1. On the **Add Storage** page, choose **5\. Tag Instance**\.

1. On the **Tag Instance** page, type a name for your Amazon EC2 instance, and then choose **6\. Configure Security Group**\.

1. On the **Configure Security Group** page, choose **Select an existing security group**\. For more information on security groups, see [Amazon EC2 security groups for Linux instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html)\.   
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/mem-ug/images/vpc-06.png)

   Choose the name of your Amazon VPC security group, and then choose **Review and Launch**\.

1. On the **Review Instance and Launch** page, choose **Launch**\.

1. In the **Selct an existing key pair or create a new key pair** window, specify a key pair that you want to use with this instance\.
**Note**  
For information about managing key pairs, see the [Amazon EC2 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/)\.

1. When you are ready to launch your Amazon EC2 instance, choose **Launch**\.

You can now assign an Elastic IP address to the Amazon EC2 instance that you just created\. You need to use this IP address to connect to the Amazon EC2 instance\.

**To assign an Elastic IP address \(Console\)**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation list, choose **Elastic IPs**\.

1. Choose **Allocate Elastic IP address**\.

1. In the **Allocate Elastic IP address** dialog box, accept the default **Network Border Group** and choose **Allocate** \.

1. Choose the Elastic IP address that you just allocated from the list and choose ** Associate Address**\.

1. In the **Associate Address** dialog box, in the **Instance** box, choose the ID of the Amazon EC2 instance that you launched\.

   In the **Private IP address** box, select the box to obtain the private IP address and then choose **Associate**\.

   You can now use SSH to connect to the Amazon EC2 instance using the Elastic IP address that you created\.

**To connect to your Amazon EC2 instance**
+ Open a command window\. At the command prompt, issue the following command, replacing *mykeypair\.pem* with the name of your key pair file and *54\.207\.55\.251* with your Elastic IP address\.

  ```
  ssh -i mykeypair.pem ec2-user@54.207.55.251 
  ```
**Important**  
Do not log out of your Amazon EC2 instance yet\.

You are now ready to interact with your ElastiCache cluster\. Before you can do that, if you haven't already done so, you need to install the *telnet* utility\.

**To install *telnet* and interact with your cache cluster \(AWS CLI\)**

1. Open a command window\. At the command prompt, issue the following command\. At the confirmation prompt, type *y*\.

   ```
   sudo yum install telnet
   Loaded plugins: priorities, security, update-motd, upgrade-helper
   Setting up Install Process

   Complete!
   ```

1. Go to the ElastiCache console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) and obtain the endpoint for one of the nodes in your cache cluster\. For more information, see [Finding Connection Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Endpoints.html) for Redis or [Finding Connection Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/mem-ug/Endpoints.html) for Memcached\.

1. Use *telnet* to connect to your cache node endpoint over port 11211\. Replace the hostname shown below with the hostname of your cache node\.

   ```
   telnet my-cache-cluster.7wufxa.0001.use1.cache.amazonaws.com 11211
   ```

   You are now connected to the cache engine and can issue commands\. In this example, you add a data item to the cache and then get it immediately afterward\. Finally, you'll disconnect from the cache node\.

   To store a key and a value, type the following two lines: 

   ```
   add mykey 0 3600 28
   This is the value for my key
   ```

   The cache engine responds with the following:

   ```
   STORED
   ```

   To retrieve the value for `mykey`, type the following:

   ```
   get mykey
   ```

   The cache engine responds with the following:

   ```
   VALUE mykey 0 28
   This is the value for my key
   END
   ```

   To disconnect from the cache engine, type the following:

   ```
   quit
   ```

**Important**  
To avoid incurring additional charges on your AWS account, be sure to delete any AWS resources you no longer want after trying these examples\.
