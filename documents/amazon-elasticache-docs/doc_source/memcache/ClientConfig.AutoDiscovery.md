# Connecting for Using Auto Discovery<a name="ClientConfig.AutoDiscovery"></a>

If your applications use Auto Discovery, you only need to know the configuration endpoint for the cluster, rather than the individual endpoints for each cache node\. For more information, see [Automatically Identify Nodes in your Memcached Cluster](AutoDiscovery.md)\.

**Note**  
At this time, Auto Discovery is only available for cache clusters running Memcached\.
