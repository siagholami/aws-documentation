# Increasing Read Capacity<a name="Scaling.RedisReplGrps.ScaleOut"></a>

To increase read capacity, add read replicas \(up to a maximum of five\) to your Redis replication group\.

You can scale your Redis clusterâ€™s read capacity using the ElastiCache console, the AWS CLI, or the ElastiCache API\. For more information, see [Adding a Read Replica, for Redis \(Cluster Mode Disabled\) Replication Groups](Replication.AddReadReplica.md)\.
