#### DAT204—Building Scalable Applications on AWS NoSQL Services \(re:Invent 2015\)<a name="WhatIs.Videos.Beginning.2015.DAT204"></a>

In this session, we discuss the benefits of NoSQL databases and take a tour of the main NoSQL services offered by AWS—Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon ElastiCache\. Then, we hear from two leading customers, Expedia and Mapbox, about their use cases and architectural challenges, and how they addressed them using AWS NoSQL services, including design patterns and best practices\. You should come out of this session having a better understanding of NoSQL and its powerful capabilities, ready to tackle your database challenges with confidence\.
