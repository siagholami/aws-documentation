Reserving one or more nodes might be a way for you to reduce costs\. Reserved nodes are charged an up front fee that depends upon the node type and the length of reservationâ€” one or three years\. 

To see if reserved nodes are a cost savings for your use cases, first determine the node size and number of nodes you need\. Then estimate the usage of the node, and compare the total cost to you of using On\-Demand nodes versus reserved nodes\. You can mix and match reserved and On\-Demand node usage in your clusters\.
