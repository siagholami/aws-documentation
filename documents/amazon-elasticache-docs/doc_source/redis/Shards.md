# Working with Shards<a name="Shards"></a>

A shard \(API/CLI: node group\) is a collection of one to six Redis nodes\. A Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster will never have more than one shard\. Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) clusters can have from 1 to 90 shards\. You can create a cluster with higher number of shards and lower number of replicas totaling up to 90 nodes per cluster\. This cluster configuration can range from 90 shards and 0 replicas to 15 shards and 5 replicas, which is the maximum number of replicas allowed\. The cluster's data is partitioned across the cluster's shards\. If there is more than one node in a shard, the shard implements replication with one node being the read/write primary node and the other nodes read\-only replica nodes\.

**Note**  
The node or shard limit can be increased to a maximum of 250 per cluster\. To request a limit increase, see [AWS Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) and select limit type "Nodes per cluster per instance type‚Äù\. 

When you create a Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) cluster using the ElastiCache console, you specify the number of shards in the cluster and the number of nodes in the shards\. For more information, see [Creating a Redis \(Cluster Mode Enabled\) Cluster \(Console\)](Clusters.Create.CON.RedisCluster.md)\. If you use the ElastiCache API or AWS CLI to create a cluster \(called *replication group* in the API/CLI\), you can configure the number of nodes in a shard \(API/CLI: node group\) independently\. For more information, see the following: 
+ API: [CreateReplicationGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/APIReference/API_CreateReplicationGroup.html)
+ CLI: [create\-replication\-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticache/create-replication-group.html)

Each node in a shard has the same compute, storage and memory specifications\. The ElastiCache API lets you control shard\-wide attributes, such as the number of nodes, security settings, and system maintenance windows\.
