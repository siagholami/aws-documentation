Identity and Access Management for AWS Auto Scaling
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps an administrator securely control access to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to use AWS Auto Scaling resources. IAM is an AWS service that you can use with no additional charge.
To use AWS Auto Scaling, you need an AWS account and AWS credentials. To increase the security of your AWS account, we recommend that you use an IAM user to provide access credentials instead of using your AWS account credentials. For more information, see AWS Account Root User Credentials vs. IAM User Credentials in the AWS General Reference and IAM Best Practices in the IAM User Guide. 
For an overview of IAM users and why they are important for the security of your account, see AWS Security Credentials in the AWS General Reference.
For details about working with IAM, see the IAM User Guide. 
Access Control
You can have valid credentials to authenticate your requests, but unless you have permissions you cannot create or access AWS Auto Scaling resources. For example, you must have permissions to create scaling plans, configure predictive scaling, and so on. 
The following sections provide details on how an IAM administrator can use IAM to help secure your AWS resources, by controlling who can perform AWS Auto Scaling actions.
