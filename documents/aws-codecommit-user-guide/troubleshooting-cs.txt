Troubleshooting console errors and AWS CodeCommit
The following information might help you troubleshoot console errors when using AWS CodeCommit repositories.
Topics
 Access error: Encryption key access denied for a CodeCommit repository from the console or AWS CLI
 Console error: Cannot browse the code in a CodeCommit repository from the console
Access error: Encryption key access denied for a CodeCommit repository from the console or AWS CLI
Problem: When you try to access CodeCommit from the console or the AWS CLI, an error message appears containing the phrase EncryptionKeyAccessDeniedException or User is not authorized for the KMS default master key for CodeCommit 'aws/codecommit' in your account.
Possible fixes: The most common cause for this error is that your AWS account is not subscribed to AWS Key Management Service, which is required for CodeCommit. Open the IAM console, choose Encryption Keys, and then choose Get Started Now. If you see a message that you are not currently subscribed to the AWS Key Management Service service, follow the instructions on that page to subscribe. For more information about CodeCommit and AWS Key Management Service, see AWS KMS and encryption. 
Console error: Cannot browse the code in a CodeCommit repository from the console
Problem: When you try to browse the contents of a repository from the console, an error message appears denying access.
Possible fixes: The most common cause for this error is that an IAM policy applied to your AWS account denies one or more of the permissions required for browsing code from the CodeCommit console. For more information about CodeCommit access permissions and browsing, see Authentication and access control for AWS CodeCommit.
