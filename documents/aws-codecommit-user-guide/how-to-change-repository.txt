Change AWS CodeCommit repository settings
You can use the AWS CLI and the AWS CodeCommit console to change the settings of an CodeCommit repository, such as its description or name.
Important
Changing a repository's name may break any local repos that use the old name in their remote URL. Run the git remote set-url command to update the remote URL to use the new repository's name.

To use the AWS CodeCommit console to change a CodeCommit repository's settings in AWS CodeCommit, follow these steps.


Open the CodeCommit console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/home.


In Repositories, choose the name of the repository where you want to change settings. 


In the navigation pane, choose Settings. 


To change the name of the repository, in Repository name, enter a new name in the Name text box and choose Save. When prompted, verify your choice. 
Important
Changing the name of the AWS CodeCommit repository will change the SSH and HTTPS URLs that users need to connect to the repository. Users will not be able to connect to this repository until they update their connection settings. Also, because the repository's ARN will change, changing the repository name will invalidate any IAM user policies that rely on this repository's ARN.
To connect to the repository after the name is changed, each user must use the git remote set-url command and specify the new URL to use. For example, if you changed the name of the repository from MyDemoRepo to MyRenamedDemoRepo, users who use HTTPS to connect to the repository would run the following Git command:  


git remote set-url origin https://git-codecommit.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/MyRenamedDemoRepo
Users who use SSH to connect to the repository would run the following Git command:  
git remote set-url origin ssh://git-codecommit.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/MyRenamedDemoRepo
For more options, see your Git documentation.


To change the repository's description, modify the text in the Description text box, and then choose Save.
Note
The description field displays Markdown in the console and accepts all HTML characters and valid Unicode characters. If you are an application developer who is using the GetRepository or BatchGetRepositories APIs and you plan to display the repository description field in a web browser, see the CodeCommit API Reference.


To change the default branch, in Default branch, choose the branch drop-down list and choose a different branch. Choose Save.


To delete the repository, choose Delete repository. In the box next to Type the name of the repository to confirm deletion, enter delete, and then choose Delete.
Important
After you delete this repository in AWS CodeCommit, you will no longer be able to clone it to any local repo or shared repo. You will also no longer be able to pull data from it, or push data to it, from any local repo or shared repo. This action cannot be undone.


Change AWS CodeCommit repository settings (AWS CLI)
To use AWS CLI commands with CodeCommit, install the AWS CLI. For more information, see Command line reference. 
To use AWS CLI to change a CodeCommit repository's settings in AWS CodeCommit, run one or more of the following commands:
 update-repository-description to change the description of an CodeCommit repository.
 update-repository-name to change the name of an CodeCommit repository.
To change a CodeCommit repository's description

Run the update-repository-description command, specifying:
     The name of the CodeCommit repository (with the --repository-name option).
Tip
To get the name of the CodeCommit repository, run the list-repositories command.
    The new repository description (with the --repository-description option).
Note
The description field displays Markdown in the console and accepts all HTML characters and valid Unicode characters. If you are an application developer who is using the GetRepository or BatchGetRepositories APIs and you plan to display the repository description field in a web browser, see the CodeCommit API Reference.

For example, to change the description for the CodeCommit repository named MyDemoRepo to This description was changed:
aws codecommit update-repository-description --repository-name MyDemoRepo --repository-description "This description was changed"
This command produces output only if there are errors.

To verify the changed description, run the get-repository command, specifying the name of the CodeCommit repository whose description you changed with the --repository-name option.

The output of the command shows the changed text in repositoryDescription.
To change a CodeCommit repository's name

Run the update-repository-name command, specifying:
    The current name of the CodeCommit repository (with the --old-name option).
Tip
To get the CodeCommit repository's name, run the list-repositories command.
    The new name of the CodeCommit repository (with the --new-name option). 

For example, to change the repository named MyDemoRepo to MyRenamedDemoRepo:
aws codecommit update-repository-name --old-name MyDemoRepo --new-name MyRenamedDemoRepo
This command produces output only if there are errors.
Important
Changing the name of the AWS CodeCommit repository changes the SSH and HTTPS URLs that users need to connect to the repository. Users cannot connect to this repository until they update their connection settings. Also, because the repository's ARN changes, changing the repository name invalidates any IAM user policies that rely on this repository's ARN.

To verify the changed name, run the list-repositories command and review the list of repository names.
