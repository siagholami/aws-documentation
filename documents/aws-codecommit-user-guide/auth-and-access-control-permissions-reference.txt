CodeCommit permissions reference
The following tables list each CodeCommit API operation, the corresponding actions for which you can grant permissions, and the format of the resource ARN to use for granting permissions. The CodeCommit APIs are grouped into tables based on the scope of the actions allowed by that API. Refer to it when setting up Access control and writing permissions policies that you can attach to an IAM identity (identity-based policies). 
When you create a permissions policy, you specify the actions in the policy's Action field. You specify the resource value in the policy's Resource field as an ARN, with or without a wildcard character (*). 
To express conditions in your CodeCommit policies, use AWS-wide condition keys. For a complete list of AWS-wide keys, see Available Keys in the IAM User Guide.
Note
To specify an action, use the codecommit: prefix followed by the API operation name (for example, codecommit:GetRepository or codecommit:CreateRepository. 
Using Wildcards 
To specify multiple actions or resources, use a wildcard character (*) in your ARN. For example, codecommit:* specifies all CodeCommit actions and codecommit:Get* specifies all CodeCommit actions that begin with the word Get. The following example grants access to all repositories with names that begin with MyDemo. 
arn:aws:codecommit:us-west-2:111111111111:MyDemo*
You can use wildcards only with the repository-name resources listed in the following table. You can't use wildcards with region or account-id resources. For more information about wildcards, see IAM Identifiers in IAM User Guide.

Required permissions for Git client commands
In CodeCommit, the GitPull IAM policy permissions apply to any Git client command where data is retrieved from CodeCommit, including git fetch, git clone, and so on. Similarly, the GitPush IAM policy permissions apply to any Git client command where data is sent to CodeCommit. For example, if the GitPush IAM policy permission is set to Allow, a user can push the deletion of a branch using the Git protocol. That push is unaffected by any permissions applied to the DeleteBranch operation for that IAM user. The DeleteBranch permission applies to actions performed with the console, the AWS CLI, the SDKs, and the API, but not the Git protocol. 
GitPull and GitPush are IAM policy permissions. They are not API actions.

GitPull
codecommit:GitPull Required to pull information from a CodeCommit repository to a local repo. This is an IAM policy permission only, not an API action.
arn:aws:codecommit:region:account-id:repository-name


GitPush
codecommit:GitPush Required to push information from a local repo to a CodeCommit repository. This is an IAM policy permission only, not an API action.  If you create a policy that includes a context key and a Deny statement that includes this permission, you must also include a Null context. For more information, see Limit pushes and merges to branches in AWS CodeCommit.
arn:aws:codecommit:region:account-id:repository-name



Permissions for actions on branches
The following permissions allow or deny actions on branches in CodeCommit repositories. These permissions pertain only to actions performed in the CodeCommit console and with the CodeCommit API, and to commands performed using the AWS CLI. They do not pertain to similar actions that can be performed using the Git protocol. For example, the git show-branch -r command displays a list of remote branches for a repository and its commits using the Git protocol. It's not affected by any permissions for the CodeCommit ListBranches operation.

Permissions for actions on committed code
The following permissions allow or deny actions on code committed to CodeCommit repositories. These permissions pertain to actions performed with the CodeCommit console and the CodeCommit API, and commands performed using the AWS CLI. They do not pertain to similar actions that can be performed using the Git protocol. For example, the git commit command creates a commit for a branch in a repository using the Git protocol. It's not affected by any permissions for the CodeCommit CreateCommit operation. 
Explicitly denying some of these permissions might result in unexpected consequences in the CodeCommit console. For example, setting GetTree to Deny prevents users from navigating the contents of a repository in the console, but does not block users from viewing the contents of a file in the repository (if they are sent a link to the file in email, for example). Setting GetBlob to Deny prevents users from viewing the contents of files, but does not block users from browsing the structure of a repository. Setting GetCommit to Deny prevents users from retrieving details about commits. Setting GetObjectIdentifier to Deny blocks most of the functionality of code browsing. If you set all three of these actions to Deny in a policy, a user with that policy cannot browse code in the CodeCommit console.
