Delete a branch in AWS CodeCommit
You can use the CodeCommit console to delete a branch in a repository. Deleting a branch in CodeCommit does not delete that branch in a local repo, so users might continue to have copies of that branch until the next time they pull changes. To delete a branch locally and push that change to the CodeCommit repository, use Git from a local repo connected to the CodeCommit repository. 
Deleting a branch does not delete any commits, but it does delete all references to the commits in that branch. If you delete a branch that contains commits that have not been merged into another branch in the repository, you cannot retrieve those commits unless you have their full commit IDs. 
Note
You cannot use the instructions in this topic to delete a repository's default branch. If you want to delete the default branch, you must create a branch, make the new branch the default branch, and then delete the old branch. For more information, see Create a branch and Change branch settings.

You can use the CodeCommit console to delete a branch in a CodeCommit repository. 


Open the CodeCommit console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/home.


In Repositories, choose the name of the repository where you want to delete a branch. 


In the navigation pane, choose Branches.


Find the name of the branch that you want to delete, choose Delete branch, and confirm your choice.


Delete a branch (AWS CLI)
You can use the AWS CLI to delete a branch in a CodeCommit repository, if that branch is not the default branch for the repository. For more information about installing and using the AWS CLI, see Command line reference. 


At the terminal or command line, run the delete-branch command, specifying:
    The name of the CodeCommit repository where the branch is to deleted (with the --repository-name option).
Tip
To get the name of the CodeCommit repository, run the list-repositories command.
    The name of the branch to delete (with the branch-name option).
Tip
To get the name of the branch, run the list-branches command.


For example, to delete a branch named MyNewBranch in an CodeCommit repository named MyDemoRepo:


aws codecommit delete-branch --repository-name MyDemoRepo --branch-name MyNewBranch
This command returns information about the deleted branch, including the name of the deleted branch and the full commit ID of the commit that was the head of the branch. For example:
"deletedBranch": {
       "branchName": "MyNewBranch",
       "commitId": "317f8570EXAMPLE"
   }
Delete a branch (Git)
Follow these steps to use Git from a local repo to delete a branch in a CodeCommit repository.
These steps are written with the assumption that you have already connected the local repo to the CodeCommit repository. For instructions, see Connect to a repository.

To delete the branch from the local repo, run the git branch -D branch-name command where branch-name is the name of the branch you want to delete.
Tip
To get a list of branch names, run git branch --all.

For example, to delete a branch in the local repo named MyNewBranch:
git branch -D MyNewBranch

To delete the branch from the CodeCommit repository, run the git push remote-name --delete branch-name command where remote-name is the nickname the local repo uses for the CodeCommit repository and branch-name is the name of the branch you want to delete from the CodeCommit repository. 
Tip
To get a list of CodeCommit repository names and their URLs, run the git remote -v command.

For example, to delete a branch named MyNewBranch in the CodeCommit repository named origin:
git push origin --delete MyNewBranch
Tip
This command does not delete a branch if it is the default branch.
For more options, see your Git documentation.
