Cross-account repository access: Actions for the administrator in AccountB
To allow users or groups in AccountB to access a repository in AccountA, the AccountB administrator must create a group in AccountB. This group must be configured with a policy that allows group members to assume the role created by the AccountA administrator. 
The following sections provide steps and examples.

Step 1: Create an IAM group for repository access for AccountB users
The simplest way to manage which IAM users in AccountB can access the AccountA repository is to create an IAM group in AccountB that has permission to assume the role in AccountA, and then add the IAM users to that group.
To create a group for cross-account repository access


Sign in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user with the permissions required to create IAM groups and policies and manage IAM users in AccountB.


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the IAM console, choose Groups.


Choose Create New Group.


In Group Name, enter a name for the group (for example, DevelopersWithCrossAccountRepositoryAccess). Choose Next Step.


In Attach Policy, choose Next Step. You create the cross-account policy in the next procedure. Finish creating the group.


Step 2: Create a policy and add users to the IAM group
Now that you have a group, create the policy that allows members of this group to assume the role that gives them access to the repository in AccountA. Then add to the group the IAM users in AccountB that you want to allow access in AccountA.
To create a policy for the group and add users to it


In the IAM console, choose Groups, and then choose the name of the group you just created (for example, DevelopersWithCrossAccountRepositoryAccess).


Choose the Permissions tab. Expand Inline Policies, and then choose the link to create an inline policy. (If you are configuring a group that already has an inline policy, choose Create Group Policy.)


Choose Custom Policy, and then choose Select. 


In Policy Name, enter a name for the policy (for example, AccessPolicyForSharedRepository).


In Policy Document, paste the following policy. In Resource, replace the ARN with the ARN of the policy created by the administrator in AccountA (for example, arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/MyCrossAccountRepositoryContributorRole), and then choose Apply Policy. For more information about the policy created by the administrator in AccountA, see Step 1: Create a policy for repository access in AccountA.

     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
       "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/MyCrossAccountRepositoryContributorRole"
     }
   }

Choose the Users tab. Choose Add Users to Group, and then add the AccountB IAM users. For example, you might add an IAM user with the user name Saanvi_Sarkar to the group.
Note
Users in AccountB must have programmatic access, including an access key and secret key, to configure their local computers for access to the shared CodeCommit repository. If you are creating IAM users, be sure to save the access key and secret key. To ensure the security of your AWS account, the secret access key is accessible only at the time you create it.
