Synchronize changes between a local repo and an AWS CodeCommit repository
You use Git to synchronize changes between a local repo and the CodeCommit repository connected to the local repo.
To push changes from the local repo to the CodeCommit repository, run git push remote-name branch-name.
To pull changes to the local repo from the CodeCommit repository, run git pull remote-name branch-name.
For both pushing and pulling, remote-name is the nickname the local repo uses for the CodeCommit repository. branch-name is the name of the branch on the CodeCommit repository to push to or pull from.
Tip
To get the nickname the local repo uses for the CodeCommit repository, run git remote. To get a list of branch names, run git branch. An asterisk (*) appears next to the name of the current branch. (You can also run git status to show the current branch name.)
Note
If you cloned the repository, from the perspective of the local repo, remote-name is not the name of the CodeCommit repository. When you clone a repository, remote-name is set automatically to origin. 
For example, to push changes from the local repo to the master branch in the CodeCommit repository with the nickname origin:
git push origin master
Similarly, to pull changes to the local repo from the master branch in the CodeCommit repository with the nickname origin:
git pull origin master
Tip
If you add the -u option to git push, you set upstream tracking information. For example, if you run git push -u origin master), in the future you can run git push and git pull without remote-name branch-name. To get upstream tracking information, run git remote show remote-name (for example, git remote show origin).
For more options, see your Git documentation.
