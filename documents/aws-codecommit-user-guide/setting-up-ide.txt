Set up connections from development tools using Git credentials
After you have configured Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit in the IAM console, you can use those credentials with any development tool that supports Git credentials. For example, you can configure access to your CodeCommit repository in AWS Cloud9, Visual Studio, Eclipse, Xcode, IntelliJ, or any integrated development environment (IDE) that integrates Git credentials. After you configure access, you can edit your code, commit your changes, and push directly from the IDE or other development tool. 
Note
If you access CodeCommit repositories using federated access, temporary credentials, or a web idenity provider, you cannot use Git credentials. We recommend that you set up your local computer using the git-remote-codecommit command. However, not all IDEs are fully compatible with Git remote helpers such as git-remote-codecommit. If you encounter problems, see Troubleshooting git-remote-codecommit and AWS CodeCommit.

When prompted by your IDE or development tool for the user name and password used to connect to the CodeCommit repository, provide the Git credentials for User name and Password you created in IAM. For example, if you are prompted for a user name and password in Eclipse, you would provide your Git credentials as follows:
