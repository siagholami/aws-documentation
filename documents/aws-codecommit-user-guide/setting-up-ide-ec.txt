Integrate Eclipse with AWS CodeCommit
You can use Eclipse to make code changes in a CodeCommit repository. The Toolkit for Eclipse integration is designed to work with Git credentials and an IAM user. You can clone existing repositories, create repositories, commit and push code changes to a repository, and more. 
To use Toolkit for Eclipse with CodeCommit, you need the following:
 Eclipse installed on your local computer.
 An IAM user with a valid set of credentials (an access key and secret key) configured for it. This IAM user should also have: 
One of the CodeCommit managed policies and the IAMSelfManageServiceSpecificCredentials managed policy applied to it.
OR
If the IAM user already has Git credentials configured, one of the CodeCommit managed policies or equivalent permissions.
For more information, see AWS managed (predefined) policies for CodeCommit and Understanding and Getting Your Security Credentials.
 An active set of Git credentials configured for the user in IAM. For more information, see Step 3: Create Git credentials for HTTPS connections to CodeCommit.

Step 1: Get an access key and secret key for your IAM user
If you do not already have a credential profile set up on the computer where Eclipse is installed, you can configure one with the AWS CLI and the aws configure command. Alternatively, you can follow the steps in this procedure to create and download your credentials. Provide them to the Toolkit for Eclipse when prompted. 
Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS. If you don't have access keys, you can create them from the AWS Management Console. As a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user access keys for any task where it's not required. Instead, create a new administrator IAM user with access keys for yourself.
The only time that you can view or download the secret access key is when you create the keys. You cannot recover them later. However, you can create new access keys at any time. You must also have permissions to perform the required IAM actions. For more information, see Permissions Required to Access IAM Resources in the IAM User Guide.
To create access keys for an IAM user


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Users.


Choose the name of the user whose access keys you want to create, and then choose the Security credentials tab.


In the Access keys section, choose Create access key.


To view the new access key pair, choose Show. You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes. Your credentials will look something like this:
    Access key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
    Secret access key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY


To download the key pair, choose Download .csv file. Store the keys in a secure location. You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes.


Keep the keys confidential in order to protect your AWS account and never email them. Do not share them outside your organization, even if an inquiry appears to come from AWS or Amazon.com. No one who legitimately represents Amazon will ever ask you for your secret key.

After you download the .csv file, choose Close. When you create an access key, the key pair is active by default, and you can use the pair right away.

Step 2: Install AWS Toolkit for Eclipse and connect to CodeCommit
The Toolkit for Eclipse is a software package you can add to Eclipse. After you've installed it and configured it with your AWS credential profile, you can connect to CodeCommit from the AWS Explorer in Eclipse. 
To install the Toolkit for Eclipse with the AWS CodeCommit module and configure access to your project repository


Install Toolkit for Eclipse on your local computer if you don't have a supported version already installed. If you need to update your version of Toolkit for Eclipse, follow the instructions in Set Up the Toolkit. 


In Eclipse, either follow the firstrun experience, or open Preferences from the Eclipse menu system (the location varies depending on your version and operating system) and choose AWS Toolkit.


Do one of the following:
    If you are following the firstrun experience, provide your AWS security credentials when prompted to set up your credential profile.
    If you are configuring in Preferences and have a credential profile already configured on your computer, choose it from Default Profile.
    If you are configuring in Preferences and you do not see the profile you want to use, or if the list is empty, choose Add profile. In Profile Details, enter a name for the profile and the credentials for the IAM user (access key and secret key), or alternatively, enter the location of the credentials file.
    If you are configuring in Preferences and you do not have a profile configured, use the links for signing up for an account or managing your existing AWS security credentials.


In Eclipse, expand the AWS Toolkit menu and choose AWS CodeCommit. Choose your credential profile, and then enter the user name and password for your Git credentials or import them from the .csv file. Choose Apply, and then choose OK.



After you are signed in with a profile, the AWS CodeCommit connection panel appears in Team Explorer with options to clone, create, or sign out. Choosing Clone clones an existing CodeCommit repository to your local computer, so you can start working on code. This is the most frequently used option. 
If you don't have any repositories, or want to create a repository, choose Create. 
Clone a CodeCommit repository from Eclipse
After you've configured your credentials, you can clone a repository to a local repo on your computer by checking it out in Eclipse. Then you can start working with the code.


In Eclipse, open AWS Explorer. For information about where to find it, see How to Access AWS Explorer. Expand AWS CodeCommit, and choose the CodeCommit repository you want to work in. You can view the commit history and other details of the repository, which can help you determine if this is the repository and branch you want to clone.
Note
If you do not see your repository, choose the flag icon to open the AWS Regions menu, and choose the AWS Region where the repository was created.



Choose Check out, and follow the instructions to clone the repository to your local computer.


When you have finished cloning the project, you're ready to start editing your code in Eclipse and staging, committing, and pushing your changes to your project's repository in CodeCommit. 


Create a CodeCommit repository from Eclipse
You can create CodeCommit repositories from Eclipse with the Toolkit for Eclipse. As part of creating the repository, you also clone it to a local repo on your computer, so you can start working with it right away.


In AWS Explorer, right-click AWS CodeCommit, and then choose Create repository. 
Note
Repositories are region-specific. Before you create the repository, make sure you have selected the correct AWS Region. You cannot choose the AWS Region after you have started the repository creation process.


In Repository Name, enter a name for this repository. Repository names must be unique within an AWS account. There are character and length limits. For more information, see Quotas. In Repository Description, enter an optional description for this repository. This helps others understand what this repository is for, and helps distinguish it from other repositories in the region. Choose OK.


In AWS Explorer, expand AWS CodeCommit, and then choose the CodeCommit repository you just created. You see that this repository has no commit history. Choose Check out, and follow the instructions to clone the repository to your local computer.


Working with CodeCommit repositories
After you have connected to CodeCommit, you can see a list of repositories associated with your account, by AWS Region, in AWS Explorer. Choose the flag menu to change the region. 
Note
CodeCommit might not be available in all AWS Regions supported by Toolkit for Eclipse.
In Toolkit for Eclipse, you can browse the contents of these repositories from the Navigation and Package Explorer views. To open a file, choose it from the list.
Git operations in Toolkit for Eclipse for CodeCommit repositories work exactly as they do for any other Git-based repository. You can make changes to code, add files, and create local commits. When you are ready to share, you use the Git Staging option to push your commits to the CodeCommit repository. If you haven't configured your author and committer information in a Git profile, you can do this before you commit and push. Because your Git credentials for your IAM user are already stored locally and associated with your connected AWS credential profile, you wonâ€™t be prompted to supply them again when you push to CodeCommit.
