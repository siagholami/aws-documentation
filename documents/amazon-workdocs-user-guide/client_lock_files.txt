Locking and unlocking files
Lock a file to prevent others from overwriting your work. While a file is locked, only the person who locked it can upload a new version.
Owners, co-owners, and contributors can lock files and send requests to unlock a file. Owners and co-owners can also unlock files. Contributors can unlock a file only if they locked it.
