# Viewing files offline<a name="view-offline"></a>

To view files offline, use Amazon WorkDocs Drive\. For more information, see [Using Amazon WorkDocs Drive](workdocs_drive_help.md)\.

If you are using Amazon WorkDocs on your Android or iOS device, you can download any file that you are authorized to download by viewing the document and opening the download icon\. This makes the file available on your device even if you are offline\. If the file you are viewing has already been downloaded, the download icon changes to a dark background\.

To view your offline files, choose **Offline Documents** in the app\. You can give feedback on a document even when offline\. Your feedback is synchronized to the server the next time you have Internet access\.
