# Sharing by invite<a name="share-invite"></a>

You can invite users and groups to share a folder or file, either within or outside your organization\. When you invite people, you choose which permissions to grant to the people that you're sharing with\. If you share a folder, the permissions for that folder apply to all the documents inside the folder\.

**To invite people to share a folder or file**

1. In the web client, select the folder or file to share\.

1. Choose **Share**, **Invite people**\. 

1. In the dialog box, start typing the name of the person or group in your organization with whom to share, and select the desired name when it is displayed in the list\. If your Amazon WorkDocs administrator has authorized you to share files with people outside your organization, you can also enter email addresses for external people and add them to the list of people with whom to share the folder or file\. 

   Repeat this step for any others you want to share the file with\.

1. Select the desired permissions for the folder or file\.  
**Co\-Owner**  
These users and groups can rename and delete files, and share the file or files in the folder with others\.  
**Contributor**  
These users and groups can provide feedback on the file or files in the folder\.  
**Viewer**  
These users and groups can only view the file or files in the folder\. They cannot provide feedback\. External users have **Viewer** as the default permission, and this can't be changed unless they are converted from a **Guest** to regular **User** by an administrator\.

1. Optionally, choose **Add personal message** to enter your own message to the people you're inviting\.

1. Choose from the following options:
   + If you're sharing a folder, choose whether it is read\-only\. If the folder is not read\-only, users can upload new files or new versions of existing files to the folder\.
   + If you're sharing a file, choose **Request feedback** to ask for feedback\. You can also set deadlines for feedback requests\.
**Note**  
Feedback can only be requested for files, not folders\. Feedback can only be requested from users, not groups\.

1. Choose **Save**\. 

An email is sent to the invitees notifying them that a file or folder has been shared with them\. The email includes a web link to the file or folder, any personal message that was entered, and the feedback deadline, if one was specified\. If you receive an error message that indicates that you cannot share a document with people outside of your organization, your administrator has not authorized you to invite new users to the organization\. Contact your Amazon WorkDocs administrator for assistance\.

Contact your administrator from the web application by choosing **Tasks**, **New task**, **Contact Administrators**\.
