# Updating approval requests<a name="update-approval"></a>

After you create an approval request, you can update it as long as it is in **Pending** status\. The items you can update depend on whether you have received any responses from approvers\.
+ **If there is no response from an approver yet** – You can update the files, groups, approvers, due date, and description\.
+ **If an approver has responded, but the approval request is still pending further approvals** – You can add a new approver to a group that is still pending response, remove an approver who has not yet responded, and change the due date\.
