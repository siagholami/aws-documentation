Tracking file activity
View your Amazon WorkDocs activity feed to keep track of changes to your files and folders, and to see who made the changes. See when files were viewed, downloaded, commented on, shared, locked, and deleted, and search for specific files, folders, or users. Activity feed searches can be filtered by activity type and date modified.
If you are an administrator, you can view activities performed by all users of a site. For more information, see Site-wide activity feed.
