Searching files and folders
Amazon WorkDocs smart search searches for search terms in all files and folders that you have permissions for. By default, it searches for terms in file and folder names, metadata, comments, labels, user names, and file owners. It also searches content within text-searchable files, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, .txt, JavaScript, and other code files. Choose the Advanced search option to view and select available search filters.
