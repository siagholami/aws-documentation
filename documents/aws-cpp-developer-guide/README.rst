########################

This repository contains the source text files for the *AWS SDK for C++ Developer Guide*.

The guide content is written in reStructuredText_ and built using Sphinx_. It relies upon content
provided in the AWS documentation team's `shared content`_ repository.


Reporting issues
================

To report a problem in the guide, use the Issues_ section of the repository.

When submitting an issue, please indicate:

* The URL or source filename where the issue occurs.

* A detailed description of the issue.


Contributing fixes and updates
==============================

To contribute a fix or update to the guide, follow the standard Github procedures for
`forking the repository`_ and submitting a `pull request`_.

Be aware that many common substitutions_ and extlinks_ in the guide are defined 
in the `shared content`_ repository. If you see a text substitution that is not 
defined at either the top of the source file or in the ``doc_source/_includes.txt`` 
file, then it is probably located in the shared content.


Building the guide
------------------

When contributing to the guide, rebuild the guide and review the changes before submitting 
a pull request.

**To build the guide:**

1. Install the Python Sphinx_ package.
2. In the repository's root directory, run the Python ``build_docs.py`` script.

``build_docs.py`` accepts arguments of any of the `available Sphinx builders`_. For example, to
build the guide in HTML format, use the ``html`` argument::

 python build_docs.py html

The build process automatically downloads the contents of the `shared content`_ repository. The 
final generated files are written to the ``doc_output`` directory.


Code examples in the documentation
----------------------------------

The code examples featured in the guide are located in a separate repository:
`aws-doc-sdk-examples <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/cpp>`_. Full
code and build files are included, so you can build and run any example yourself.

In addition to examples in C++, the repository includes examples in the other programming 
languages supported by the AWS SDKs. If you discover an issue with any example, submit an 
issue or fork the repository and submit a pull request.

The code examples are provided under the *Apache 2.0* open source license. See the example
repository's `README <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/README.rst>`_ for
details.
