   :description: How to manage access control lists for an Amazon S3 bucket or object.
   :keywords: s3

Access permissions for an |s3| bucket or object are defined in an access 
control list (ACL). The ACL specifies the owner of the bucket/object and a 
list of grants. Each grant specifies a user (or grantee) and the user's 
permissions to access the bucket/object, such as READ or WRITE access.


Manage an Object's Access Control List
======================================

The access control list for an object can be retrieved by calling the 
``S3Client`` method :functionname:`GetObjectAcl`. The method accepts the 
names of the object and its bucket. The return value includes the ACL's 
``Owner`` and list of ``Grants``.

The ACL can be modified by either creating a new ACL or changing the grants 
specified in the current ACL. The updated ACL becomes the new current ACL by 
passing it to the :functionname:`PutObjectAcl` method.

The following code uses the ACL retrieved by :functionname:`GetObjectAcl` 
and adds a new grant to it. The user or grantee is given READ permission for 
the object. The modified ACL is passed to :functionname:`PutObjectAcl`, making 
it the new current ACL. For further details, see 
:sdk-examples-cpp:`the example source file <s3/get_put_object_acl.cpp>`.

Manage a Bucket's Access Control List
=====================================

In most cases, the preferred method for setting the access permissions of a 
bucket is to define a bucket policy. However, buckets also support access 
control lists for users who wish to use them.

Management of an access control list for a bucket is identical to that 
used for an object. The :functionname:`GetBucketAcl` method retrieves a 
bucket's current ACL and :functionname:`PutBucketAcl` applies a new ACL to 
the bucket.

The following code demonstrates getting and setting a bucket ACL. For details, 
see :sdk-examples-cpp:`the example source file <s3/get_put_bucket_acl.cpp>`.
