Configuring an |s3| Bucket as a Website
#######################################

.. meta::
   :description: How to manage an S3 bucket's website configuration using the AWS SDK for C++.
   :keywords: s3

You can configure an |s3| bucket to behave as a website. To do this, you need to set its website
configuration.

.. include:: includes/examples-note.txt

Set a Bucket's Website Configuration
====================================

To set an |s3| bucket's website configuration, call the |s3client|'s
:functionname:`PutBucketWebsite` function with a :aws-cpp-class:`PutBucketWebsiteRequest
<aws_1_1_s3_1_1_model_1_1_put_bucket_website_request>` object containing the bucket name and its
website configuration, provided in a :aws-cpp-class:`WebsiteConfiguration
<aws_1_1_s3_1_1_model_1_1_website_configuration>` object.

Setting an index document is *required*; all other parameters are optional.

**Includes**

.. literalinclude:: s3.cpp.put_website_config.inc.txt

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: s3.cpp.put_website_config.code.txt

.. note:: Setting a website configuration does not modify the access permissions for your bucket.
   To make your files visible on the web, you will also need to set a *bucket policy* that allows
   public read access to the files in the bucket. For more information, see
   :doc:`examples-s3-bucket-policies`.

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <s3/put_website_config.cpp>`.


Get a Bucket's Website Configuration
====================================

To get an |s3| bucket's website configuration, call the |s3client|'s
:functionname:`GetBucketWebsite` function with a :aws-cpp-class:`GetBucketWebsiteRequest
<aws_1_1_s3_1_1_model_1_1_get_bucket_website_request>` containing the name of the bucket to retrieve
the configuration for.

The configuration will be returned as a :aws-cpp-class:`GetBucketWebsiteResult
<aws_1_1_s3_1_1_model_1_1_get_bucket_website_result>` object within the outcome object. If there is
no website configuration for the bucket, then :code-cpp:`null` will be returned.

**Includes**

.. literalinclude:: s3.cpp.get_website_config.inc.txt

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: s3.cpp.get_website_config.code.txt

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <s3/get_website_config.cpp>`.


Delete a Bucket's Website Configuration
=======================================

To delete an |s3| bucket's website configuration, call the |s3client|'s
:functionname:`DeleteBucketWebsite` function with a :aws-cpp-class:`DeleteBucketWebsiteRequest
<aws_1_1_s3_1_1_model_1_1_delete_bucket_website_request>`: containing the name of the bucket to
delete the configuration from.

**Includes**

.. literalinclude:: s3.cpp.delete_website_config.inc.txt

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: s3.cpp.delete_website_config.code.txt

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <s3/delete_website_config.cpp>`.
