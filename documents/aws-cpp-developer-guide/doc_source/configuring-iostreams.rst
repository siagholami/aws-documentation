Controlling IOStreams Used by the HttpClient and the AWSClient
##############################################################

    :description:
        Overriding default HttpClient IOStreams with the AWS SDK for C++.
    :keywords:

By default, all responses use an input stream backed by a ``stringbuf``. If needed, you can override
the default behavior. For example, if you are using an |S3| ``GetObject`` and don't want to load
the entire file into memory, you can use :classname:`IOStreamFactory` in
:classname:`AmazonWebServiceRequest` to pass a lambda to create a file stream.

**Example file stream request**

.. code-block:: cpp

    GetObjectRequest getObjectRequest;
    getObjectRequest.SetBucket(fullBucketName);
    getObjectRequest.SetKey(keyName);
    getObjectRequest.SetResponseStreamFactory([](){
        return Aws::New<Aws::FStream>(
            ALLOCATION_TAG, DOWNLOADED_FILENAME, std::ios_base::out); });

    auto getObjectOutcome = s3Client->GetObject(getObjectRequest);
