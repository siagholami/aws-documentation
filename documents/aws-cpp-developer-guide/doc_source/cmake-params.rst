    :description:
        Customizing AWS SDK for C++ builds with CMake parameters.
    :keywords:

Use the CMake_ parameters listed in this section to customize how your SDK builds.

You can set these options with CMake GUI tools or the command line by using :paramname:`-D`. For
example::

 cmake -DENABLE_UNITY_BUILD=ON -DREGENERATE_CLIENTS=1


.. _cmake-general-options:

General CMake Variables and Options
===================================

The following are general :command:`cmake` variables and options that affect your SDK build.

.. note:: To use the :paramname:`ADD_CUSTOM_CLIENTS` or :paramname:`REGENERATE_CLIENTS` variables,
   you must have `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_, Java (`JDK 1.8+
   <http://openjdk.java.net/install/>`_), and Maven_ installed and in your :envvar:`PATH`.

.. contents::
    :local:
    :depth: 1


.. _cmake-add-custom-clients:

ADD_CUSTOM_CLIENTS
------------------

Builds any arbitrary clients based on the API definition. Place your definition in the
:file:`code-generation/api-definitions` folder, and then pass this argument to :command:`cmake`.
The :command:`cmake` configure step generates your client and includes it as a subdirectory in your
build. This is particularly useful to generate a C++ client for using one of your |ABP|_
services. For example::

 -DADD_CUSTOM_CLIENTS="serviceName=myCustomService;version=2015-12-21;serviceName=someOtherService;version=2015-08-15"


.. _cmake-build-only:

BUILD_ONLY
----------

Builds only the clients you want to use. If set to a high-level SDK such as
``aws-cpp-sdk-transfer``, :paramname:`BUILD_ONLY` resolves any low-level client
dependencies. It also builds integration and unit tests related to the projects you select,
if they exist. This is a list argument, with values separated by semicolon (``;``) characters.
For example::

 -DBUILD_ONLY="s3;cognito-identity"

.. note:: The core SDK module, ``aws-sdk-cpp-core``, is *always* built, regardless of the value of
   the :paramname:`BUILD_ONLY` parameter.


.. _cmake-build-shared-libs:

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
-----------------

A built-in CMake option, re-exposed here for visibility. If enabled, it builds shared libraries;
otherwise, it builds only static libraries.

.. note:: To dynamically link to the SDK, you must define the ``USE_IMPORT_EXPORT`` symbol
   for all build targets using the SDK.

:Values: *ON* | *OFF*
:Default: *ON*


.. _cmake-cpp-standard:

CPP_STANDARD
------------

Specifies a custom C++ standard for use with C++ 14 and 17 code bases.

:Values: *11* | *14* | *17*
:Default: *11*


.. _cmake-custom-memory-management:

CUSTOM_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT
------------------------

To use a custom memory manager, set the value to ``1``. You can install a custom allocator so that all
STL types use the custom allocation interface. If you set the value ``0``, you still might
want to use the STL template types to help with DLL safety on Windows.

If static linking is enabled, custom memory management defaults to *off* (``0``). If dynamic linking
is enabled, custom memory management defaults to *on* (``1``) and avoids cross-DLL allocation and
deallocation.

.. note:: To prevent linker mismatch errors, you must use the same value (``0`` or ``1``) throughout
   your build system.

To install your own memory manager to handle allocations made by the SDK, you must set
``-DCUSTOM_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT`` and define ``AWS_CUSTOM_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT`` for all build targets
that depend on the SDK.


.. _cmake-enable-rtti:

ENABLE_RTTI
-----------

Controls whether the SDK is built to enable run-time type information (RTTI).

:Values: *ON* | *OFF*
:Default: *ON*


.. _cmake-enable-testing:

ENABLE_TESTING
--------------

Controls whether unit and integration test projects are built during the SDK build.

:Values: *ON* | *OFF*
:Default: *ON*


.. _cmake-enable-unity-build:

ENABLE_UNITY_BUILD
------------------

If enabled, most SDK libraries are built as a single, generated :file:`.cpp` file. This can
significantly reduce static library size and speed up compilation time.

:Values: *ON* | *OFF*
:Default: *OFF*


.. _cmake-force-shared-crt:

FORCE_SHARED_CRT
----------------

If enabled, the SDK links to the C runtime *dynamically*; otherwise, it uses the
:paramname:`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` setting (sometimes necessary for backward compatibility with earlier
versions of the SDK).

:Values: *ON* | *OFF*
:Default: *ON*


.. _cmake-g:

G
-

Generates build artifacts, such as Visual Studio solutions and Xcode projects.

For example, on Windows::

 -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64"

For more information, see the CMake documentation for your platform.


.. _cmake-minimize-size:

MINIMIZE_SIZE
-------------

A superset of :ref:`cmake-enable-unity-build`. If enabled, this option turns on
:paramname:`ENABLE_UNITY_BUILD` and additional binary size reduction settings.

:Values: *ON* | *OFF*
:Default: *OFF*


.. _cmake-no-encryption:

NO_ENCRYPTION
-------------

If enabled, prevents the default platform-specific cryptography implementation from being built into
the library. Turn this *ON* to inject your own cryptography implementation.

:Values: *ON* | *OFF*
:Default: *OFF*


.. _cmake-no-http-client:

NO_HTTP_CLIENT
--------------

If enabled, prevents the default platform-specific HTTP client from being built into the library.
Turn this *ON* to inject your own HTTP client implementation.

:Values: *ON* | *OFF*
:Default: *OFF*


.. _cmake-regenerate-clients:

REGENERATE_CLIENTS
------------------

This argument wipes out all generated code and generates the client directories from the
:file:`code-generation/api-definitions` folder. For example::

 -DREGENERATE_CLIENTS=1


.. _cmake-simple-install:

SIMPLE_INSTALL
--------------

If enabled, the install process does not insert platform-specific intermediate directories
underneath :file:`bin/` and :file:`lib/`. Turn *OFF* if you need to make multiplatform releases
under a single install directory.

:Values: *ON* | *OFF*
:Default: *ON*


.. _cmake-target-arch:

TARGET_ARCH
-----------

To cross-compile or build for a mobile platform, you must specify the target platform. By default,
the build detects the host operating system and builds for the detected operating system.

.. note:: When :paramname:`TARGET_ARCH` is *ANDROID*, additional options are available. See
   :ref:`cmake-android-variables`.

:Values: *WINDOWS* | *LINUX* | *APPLE* | *ANDROID*



.. _cmake-android-variables:

Android CMake Variables and Options
===================================

Use the following variables when you are creating an Android build of the SDK (when :ref:`cmake-target-arch` is
set to *ANDROID*).

.. contents::
    :local:
    :depth: 1


.. _cmake-android-abi:

ANDROID_ABI
-----------

Controls which Application Binary Interface (ABI) to output code for.

.. note:: Not all valid Android ABI values are currently supported.

:Values: *arm64* | *armeabi-v7a* | *x86_64* | *x86* | *mips64* | *mips*
:Default: *armeabi-v7a*


.. _cmake-android-native-api-level:

ANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL
------------------------

Controls what API level the SDK builds against. If you set :ref:`cmake-android-stl` to
*gnustl*, you can choose any API level. If you use *libc++*, you must use
an API level of at least *21*.

:Default: Varies by STL choice.


.. _cmake-android-stl:

ANDROID_STL
-----------

Controls what flavor of the C++ standard library the SDK uses.

.. important:: Performance problems can occur within the SDK if the ``gnustl`` options are used; we
   strongly recommend using *libc++_shared* or *libc++_static*.

:Values: *libc++_shared* | *libc++_static* | *gnustl_shared* | *gnustl_static*
:Default: *libc++_shared*


.. _cmake-android-toolchain-name:

ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_NAME
----------------------

Controls which compiler is used to build the SDK.

.. note:: With GCC being deprecated by the Android NDK, we recommend using the default value.

:Default: *standalone-clang*


.. _cmake-disable-android-standalone-build:

DISABLE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_BUILD
--------------------------------

By default, Android builds use a standalone clang-based toolchain constructed via NDK scripts. To
use your own toolchain, turn this option *ON*.

:Values: *ON* | *OFF*
:Default: *OFF*

.. _cmake-ndk-dir:

NDK_DIR
-------

Specifies an override path where the build system should find the Android NDK. By default, the build
system checks environment variables (:envvar:`ANDROID_NDK`) if this variable is not set.
