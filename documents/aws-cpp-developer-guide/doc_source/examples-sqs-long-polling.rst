Enabling Long Polling for |SQS| Message Queues
##############################################

.. meta::
   :description: How to enable long polling for Amazon SQS message queues using the AWS SDK for C++.
   :keywords: sqs

|SQS| uses *short polling* by default, querying only a subset of the servers—based on a weighted
random distribution—to determine whether any messages are available for inclusion in the response.

Long polling helps reduce your cost of using |SQS| by reducing the number of empty responses when
there are no messages available to return in reply to a ReceiveMessage request sent to an |SQS|
queue and eliminating false empty responses. You can set a long polling frequency from *1–20
seconds*.

.. _sqs-long-polling-create-queue:

Enable Long Polling when Creating a Queue
=========================================

To enable long polling when creating an |SQS| queue, set the ``ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds``
attribute on the :aws-cpp-class:`CreateQueueRequest
<aws_1_1_s_q_s_1_1_model_1_1_create_queue_request>` object before calling the |sqsclient| class'
:functionname:`CreateQueue` member function.

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <sqs/long_polling_on_create_queue.cpp>`.


.. _sqs-long-polling-existing-queue:

Enable Long Polling on an Existing Queue
========================================

In addition to enabling long polling when creating a queue, you can also enable it on an existing
queue by setting ``ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds`` on the :aws-cpp-class:`SetQueueAttributesRequest
<aws_1_1_s_q_s_1_1_model_1_1_set_queue_attributes_request>` before calling the |sqsclient| class'
:functionname:`SetQueueAttributes` member function.

.. _sqs-long-polling-receive-message:

Enable Long Polling on Message Receipt
======================================

You can enable long polling when receiving a message by setting the wait time in seconds on the
:aws-cpp-class:`ReceiveMessageRequest <aws_1_1_s_q_s_1_1_model_1_1_receive_message_request>` that
you supply to the |sqsclient| class' ReceiveMessage member function.

.. note:: You should make sure that the AWS client's request timeout is larger than the maximum long
   poll time (20s) so that your :functionname:`ReceiveMessage` requests don't time out while waiting
   for the next poll event!
