    :description: Managing Amazon S3 buckets using the AWS SDK for C++.
    :keywords: s3

Every *object* or file in |S3long| must reside within a *bucket* which represents a folder
of objects. Each bucket is known by a name that must be globally unique within the AWS
ecosystem. For detailed information about buckets and their configuration, 
see :s3-dg:`Working with Amazon S3 Buckets<UsingBucket>` in the |s3-dg|.

.. _create-bucket:

Create a Bucket
===============

Use the |s3client| object :functionname:`CreateBucket` method, passing it a
:classname:`CreateBucketRequest` with the bucket's name. By default, buckets are
created in the *us-east-1* (N. Virginia) region. The code example demonstrates
how to create a bucket in any specified region.

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <s3/create_bucket.cpp>`.


.. _list-buckets:

List Buckets
============

Use the |s3client| object :functionname:`ListBucket` method. If successful, the method returns a
:classname:`ListBucketOutcome` object, which contains a :classname:`ListBucketResult`
object.

Use the :classname:`ListBucketResult` object :functionname:`GetBuckets` method to get a list of
:classname:`Bucket` objects that contain information about each |S3| bucket in your account.

.. _delete-bucket:

Delete a Bucket
===============

Use the |s3client| object :functionname:`DeleteBucket` method, passing it a
:classname:`DeleteBucketRequest` object that is set with the name of the bucket to delete. *The
bucket must be empty or an error will result*.
