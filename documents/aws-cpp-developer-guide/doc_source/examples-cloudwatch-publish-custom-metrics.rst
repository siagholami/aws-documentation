   :description: How to publish custom metric data to Amazon Cloudwatch using the AWS SDK for C++.
   :keywords: cloudwatch


A number of AWS services publish :cw-ug:`their own metrics <aws-namespaces>` in namespaces beginning
with "AWS/" You can also publish custom metric data using your own namespace (as long as it doesn't
begin with "AWS/").

.. include:: includes/examples-note.txt

Publish Custom Metric Data
==========================

To publish your own metric data, call the |cwclient|'s :functionname:`PutMetricData` function with a
:aws-cpp-class:`PutMetricDataRequest <aws_1_1_cloud_watch_1_1_model_1_1_put_metric_data_request>`.
The :classname:`PutMetricDataRequest` must include the custom namespace to use for the data, and
information about the data point itself in a :aws-cpp-class:`MetricDatum
<aws_1_1_cloud_watch_1_1_model_1_1_metric_datum>` object.

.. note:: You cannot specify a namespace that begins with "AWS/". Namespaces that begin with
   "AWS/" are reserved for use by Amazon Web Services products.
