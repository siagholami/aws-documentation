AppStream 2.0 Metrics and Dimensions
Amazon AppStream 2.0 sends the following metrics and dimension information to Amazon CloudWatch.
Amazon AppStream 2.0 Metrics
AppStream 2.0 sends metrics to CloudWatch one time every minute. The AWS/AppStream namespace includes the following metrics.



Metric
Description




ActualCapacity
The total number of instances that are available for streaming or are currently streaming. ActualCapacity = AvailableCapacity  InUseCapacity Units: Count Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum


AvailableCapacity
The number of idle instances currently available for user sessions. AvailableCapacity = ActualCapacity - InUseCapacity Units: Count Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum


CapacityUtilization
The percentage of instances in a fleet that are being used, using the following formula. CapacityUtilization = (InUseCapacity/ActualCapacity) * 100 Monitoring this metric helps with decisions about increasing or decreasing the value of a fleet's desired capacity. Units: Percent Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum


DesiredCapacity
The total number of instances that are either running or pending. This represents the total number of concurrent streaming sessions your fleet can support in a steady state. DesiredCapacity = ActualCapacity  PendingCapacity Units: Count Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum


InUseCapacity
The number of instances currently being used for streaming sessions. One InUseCapacity count represents one streaming session. Units: Count Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum


PendingCapacity
The number of instances being provisioned by AppStream 2.0. Represents the additional number of streaming sessions the fleet can support after provisioning is complete. When provisioning starts, it usually takes 10-20 minutes for an instance to become available for streaming. Units: Count Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum


RunningCapacity
The total number of instances currently running. Represents the number of concurrent streaming sessions that can be supported by the fleet in its current state. This metric is provided for Always-On fleets only, and has the same value as the ActualCapacity metric. Units: Count Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum


InsufficientCapacityError
The number of session requests rejected due to lack of capacity. You can set alarms to use this metric to be notified of users waiting for streaming sessions. Units: Count Valid statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum
