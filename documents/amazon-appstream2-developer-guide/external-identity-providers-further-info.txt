Shibboleth
Single Sign-On: Integrating AWS, OpenLDAP, and Shibboleth — Describes how to set up the initial federation between the Shibboleth IdP and the AWS Management Console. You must complete the following additional steps to enable federation to AppStream 2.0. Step 4 of the AWS Security whitepaper describes how to create IAM roles that define the permissions that federated users have to the AWS Management Console. After you create these roles and embed the inline policy as described in the whitepaper, modify this policy so that it provides federated users with permissions to access only an AppStream 2.0 stack. To do this, replace the existing policy with the policy noted in Step 3: Embed an Inline Policy for the IAM Role, in Setting Up SAML.When you add the stack relay state URL as described in Step 6: Configure the Relay State of Your Federation, in Setting Up SAML, add the relay state parameter to the federation URL as a target request attribute. For information about configuring relay state parameters, see the SAML 2.0 section in the Shibboleth documentation.
