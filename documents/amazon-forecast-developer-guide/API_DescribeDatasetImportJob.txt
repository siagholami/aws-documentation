Response Elements
If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.
The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.
 CreationTime  
When the dataset import job was created.
Type: Timestamp
 DatasetArn  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset that the training data was imported to.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$ 
 DatasetImportJobArn  
The ARN of the dataset import job.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$ 
 DatasetImportJobName  
The name of the dataset import job.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 63.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]* 
 DataSize  
The size of the dataset in gigabytes (GB) after the import job has finished.
Type: Double
 DataSource  
The location of the training data to import and an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the data.
If encryption is used, DataSource includes an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key.
Type: DataSource object
 FieldStatistics  
Statistical information about each field in the input data.
Type: String to Statistics object map
Key Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Key Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\_]$ 
 LastModificationTime  
The last time that the dataset was modified. The time depends on the status of the job, as follows:
  CREATE_PENDING - The same time as CreationTime.
  CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.
  ACTIVE or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.
Type: Timestamp
 Message  
If an error occurred, an informational message about the error.
Type: String
 Status  
The status of the dataset import job. The status is reflected in the status of the dataset. For example, when the import job status is CREATE_IN_PROGRESS, the status of the dataset is UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS. States include:
  ACTIVE 
  CREATE_PENDING, CREATE_IN_PROGRESS, CREATE_FAILED 
  DELETE_PENDING, DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, DELETE_FAILED 
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
 TimestampFormat  
The format of timestamps in the dataset. The format that you specify depends on the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created. The following formats are supported
 "yyyy-MM-dd"
For the following data frequencies: Y, M, W, and D
 "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
For the following data frequencies: H, 30min, 15min, and 1min; and optionally, for: Y, M, W, and D
Type: String
