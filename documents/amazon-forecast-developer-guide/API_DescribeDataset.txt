DescribeDataset
Describes an Amazon Forecast dataset created using the CreateDataset operation.
In addition to listing the parameters specified in the CreateDataset request, this operation includes the following dataset properties:
  CreationTime 
  LastModificationTime 
  Status 
Request Syntax
{
   "DatasetArn": "string"
}
Request Parameters
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 DatasetArn  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$ 
Required: Yes

Response Elements
If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.
The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.
 CreationTime  
When the dataset was created.
Type: Timestamp
 DataFrequency  
The frequency of data collection.
Valid intervals are Y (Year), M (Month), W (Week), D (Day), H (Hour), 30min (30 minutes), 15min (15 minutes), 10min (10 minutes), 5min (5 minutes), and 1min (1 minute). For example, "M" indicates every month and "30min" indicates every 30 minutes.
Type: String
Pattern: ^Y|M|W|D|H|30min|15min|10min|5min|1min$ 
 DatasetArn  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$ 
 DatasetName  
The name of the dataset.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 63.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]* 
 DatasetType  
The dataset type.
Type: String
Valid Values:TARGET_TIME_SERIES | RELATED_TIME_SERIES | ITEM_METADATA 
 Domain  
The domain associated with the dataset.
Type: String
Valid Values:RETAIL | CUSTOM | INVENTORY_PLANNING | EC2_CAPACITY | WORK_FORCE | WEB_TRAFFIC | METRICS 
 EncryptionConfig  
The AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key and the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the key.
Type: EncryptionConfig object
 LastModificationTime  
When you create a dataset, LastModificationTime is the same as CreationTime. While data is being imported to the dataset, LastModificationTime is the current time of the DescribeDataset call. After a CreateDatasetImportJob operation has finished, LastModificationTime is when the import job completed or failed.
Type: Timestamp
 Schema  
An array of SchemaAttribute objects that specify the dataset fields. Each SchemaAttribute specifies the name and data type of a field.
Type: Schema object
 Status  
The status of the dataset. States include:
  ACTIVE 
  CREATE_PENDING, CREATE_IN_PROGRESS, CREATE_FAILED 
  DELETE_PENDING, DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, DELETE_FAILED 
  UPDATE_PENDING, UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS, UPDATE_FAILED 
The UPDATE states apply while data is imported to the dataset from a call to the CreateDatasetImportJob operation and reflect the status of the dataset import job. For example, when the import job status is CREATE_IN_PROGRESS, the status of the dataset is UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS.
The Status of the dataset must be ACTIVE before you can import training data.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Errors
InvalidInputException 
We can't process the request because it includes an invalid value or a value that exceeds the valid range.
HTTP Status Code: 400
ResourceNotFoundException 
We can't find a resource with that Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Check the ARN and try again.
