FeaturizationConfig
In a CreatePredictor operation, the specified algorithm trains a model using the specified dataset group. You can optionally tell the operation to modify data fields prior to training a model. These modifications are referred to as featurization.
You define featurization using the FeaturizationConfig object. You specify an array of transformations, one for each field that you want to featurize. You then include the FeaturizationConfig object in your CreatePredictor request. Amazon Forecast applies the featurization to the TARGET_TIME_SERIES and RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets before model training.
You can create multiple featurization configurations. For example, you might call the CreatePredictor operation twice by specifying different featurization configurations.

Featurizations 
An array of featurization (transformation) information for the fields of a dataset.
Type: Array of Featurization objects
Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 50 items.
Required: No
ForecastDimensions 
An array of dimension (field) names that specify how to group the generated forecast.
For example, suppose that you are generating a forecast for item sales across all of your stores, and your dataset contains a store_id field. If you want the sales forecast for each item by store, you would specify store_id as the dimension.
All forecast dimensions specified in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset don't need to be specified in the CreatePredictor request. All forecast dimensions specified in the RELATED_TIME_SERIES dataset must be specified in the CreatePredictor request.
Type: Array of strings
Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 5 items.
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 63.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]* 
Required: No
ForecastFrequency 
The frequency of predictions in a forecast.
Valid intervals are Y (Year), M (Month), W (Week), D (Day), H (Hour), 30min (30 minutes), 15min (15 minutes), 10min (10 minutes), 5min (5 minutes), and 1min (1 minute). For example, "Y" indicates every year and "5min" indicates every five minutes.
The frequency must be greater than or equal to the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset frequency.
When a RELATED_TIME_SERIES dataset is provided, the frequency must be equal to the RELATED_TIME_SERIES dataset frequency.
Type: String
Pattern: ^Y|M|W|D|H|30min|15min|10min|5min|1min$ 
Required: Yes
