# CreateForecast<a name="API_CreateForecast"></a>

Creates a forecast for each item in the `TARGET_TIME_SERIES` dataset that was used to train the predictor\. This is known as inference\. To retrieve the forecast for a single item at low latency, use the [QueryForecast](API_forecastquery_QueryForecast.md) operation\. To export the complete forecast into your Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket, use the [CreateForecastExportJob](API_CreateForecastExportJob.md) operation\.

The range of the forecast is determined by the `ForecastHorizon` value, which you specify in the [CreatePredictor](API_CreatePredictor.md) request\. When you query a forecast, you can request a specific date range within the forecast\.

To get a list of all your forecasts, use the [ListForecasts](API_ListForecasts.md) operation\.

**Note**  
The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same time zone as the dataset that was used to create the predictor\.

For more information, see [Forecasts](howitworks-forecast.md)\.

**Note**  
The `Status` of the forecast must be `ACTIVE` before you can query or export the forecast\. Use the [DescribeForecast](API_DescribeForecast.md) operation to get the status\.

```
{
   "ForecastName": "string",
   "ForecastTypes": [ "string" ],
   "PredictorArn": "string",
   "Tags": [ 
      { 
         "Key": "string",

## Request Parameters<a name="API_CreateForecast_RequestParameters"></a>

The request accepts the following data in JSON format\.

 ** [ForecastName](#API_CreateForecast_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="forecast-CreateForecast-request-ForecastName"></a>
A name for the forecast\.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1\. Maximum length of 63\.  
Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`   
Required: Yes

 ** [ForecastTypes](#API_CreateForecast_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="forecast-CreateForecast-request-ForecastTypes"></a>
The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts are generated\. **You can currently specify up to 5 quantiles per forecast**\. Accepted values include `0.01 to 0.99` \(increments of \.01 only\) and `mean`\. The mean forecast is different from the median \(0\.50\) when the distribution is not symmetric \(for example, Beta and Negative Binomial\)\. The default value is `["0.1", "0.5", "0.9"]`\.  
Type: Array of strings  
Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item\. Maximum number of 20 items\.  
Pattern: `(^0?\.\d\d?$|^mean$)`   
Required: No

 ** [PredictorArn](#API_CreateForecast_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="forecast-CreateForecast-request-PredictorArn"></a>
The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the predictor to use to generate the forecast\.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256\.  
Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]+$`   
Required: Yes

 ** [Tags](#API_CreateForecast_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="forecast-CreateForecast-request-Tags"></a>
The optional metadata that you apply to the forecast to help you categorize and organize them\. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define\.  
The following basic restrictions apply to tags:  
+ Maximum number of tags per resource \- 50\.
+ For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value\.
+ Maximum key length \- 128 Unicode characters in UTF\-8\.
+ Maximum value length \- 256 Unicode characters in UTF\-8\.
+ If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters\. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF\-8, and the following characters: \+ \- = \. \_ : / @\.
+ Tag keys and values are case sensitive\.
+ Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use\. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix\. Values can have this prefix\. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags\. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit\.
Type: Array of [Tag](API_Tag.md) objects  
Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items\. Maximum number of 200 items\.  
Required: No

## Response Syntax<a name="API_CreateForecast_ResponseSyntax"></a>

```

```

## Response Elements<a name="API_CreateForecast_ResponseElements"></a>

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response\.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service\.

 ** [ForecastArn](#API_CreateForecast_ResponseSyntax) **   <a name="forecast-CreateForecast-response-ForecastArn"></a>
The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the forecast\.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256\.  
Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]+$` 

## Errors<a name="API_CreateForecast_Errors"></a>

HTTP Status Code: 400

 **ResourceAlreadyExistsException**   
There is already a resource with this name\. Try again with a different name\.  
HTTP Status Code: 400

 **ResourceInUseException**   
The specified resource is in use\.  
HTTP Status Code: 400

 **ResourceNotFoundException**   
We can't find a resource with that Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\)\. Check the ARN and try again\.
