Prophet Algorithm
Prophet is a popular local Bayesian structural time series model. The Amazon Forecast Prophet algorithm uses the Prophet class of the Python implementation of Prophet.
How Prophet Works
Prophet is especially useful for datasets that:
 Contain an extended time period (months or years) of detailed historical observations (hourly, daily, or weekly)
 Have multiple strong seasonalities
 Include previously known important, but irregular, events
 Have missing data points or large outliers
 Have non-linear growth trends that are approaching a limit
Prophet is an additive regression model with a piecewise linear or logistic growth curve trend. It includes a yearly seasonal component modeled using Fourier series and a weekly seasonal component modeled using dummy variables.

Prophet Hyperparameters and Related Time Series
Amazon Forecast uses the default Prophet hyperparameters. Prophet also supports related time-series as features, provided to Amazon Forecast in the related time-series CSV file.
