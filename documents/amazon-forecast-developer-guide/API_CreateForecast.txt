CreateForecast
Creates a forecast for each item in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset that was used to train the predictor. This is known as inference. To retrieve the forecast for a single item at low latency, use the QueryForecast operation. To export the complete forecast into your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, use the CreateForecastExportJob operation.
The range of the forecast is determined by the ForecastHorizon value, which you specify in the CreatePredictor request. When you query a forecast, you can request a specific date range within the forecast.
To get a list of all your forecasts, use the ListForecasts operation.
Note
The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same time zone as the dataset that was used to create the predictor.
For more information, see Forecasts.
Note
The Status of the forecast must be ACTIVE before you can query or export the forecast. Use the DescribeForecast operation to get the status.
Request Syntax
{
   "ForecastName": "string",
   "ForecastTypes": [ "string" ],
   "PredictorArn": "string",
   "Tags": [ 
      { 
         "Key": "string",
         "Value": "string"
      }
   ]
}
Request Parameters
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 ForecastName  
A name for the forecast.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 63.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]* 
Required: Yes
 ForecastTypes  
The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts are generated. You can currently specify up to 5 quantiles per forecast. Accepted values include 0.01 to 0.99 (increments of .01 only) and mean. The mean forecast is different from the median (0.50) when the distribution is not symmetric (for example, Beta and Negative Binomial). The default value is ["0.1", "0.5", "0.9"].
Type: Array of strings
Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 20 items.
Pattern: (^0?\.\d\d?$|^mean$) 
Required: No
 PredictorArn  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor to use to generate the forecast.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$ 
Required: Yes
 Tags  
The optional metadata that you apply to the forecast to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
 Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
 For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
 Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
 Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
 If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters:  - = . _ : / @.
 Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
 Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.
Type: Array of Tag objects
Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 200 items.
Required: No
Response Syntax
{
   "ForecastArn": "string"
}
Response Elements
If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.
The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.
 ForecastArn  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the forecast.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.\/\:]$
