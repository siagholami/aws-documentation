Monitoring an Amazon Aurora DB Cluster
This section shows how to monitor Amazon Aurora. Aurora involves clusters of database servers that are connected in a replication topology. Monitoring an Aurora cluster typically requires checking the health of multiple DB instances. The instances might have specialized roles, handling mostly write operations, only read operations, or a combination of both. You also monitor the overall health of the cluster by measuring the replication lag, the amount of time for changes made by one DB instance to be available to the other instances.
