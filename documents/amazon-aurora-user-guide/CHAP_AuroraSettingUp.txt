Configuring Your Amazon Aurora DB Cluster
This section shows how to set up your Aurora DB cluster. Before creating an Aurora DB cluster, decide on the DB instance class that will run the DB cluster. Also, decide where the DB cluster will run by choosing an AWS Region. Next, create the DB cluster. If you have data outside of Aurora, you can migrate the data into an Aurora DB cluster.
