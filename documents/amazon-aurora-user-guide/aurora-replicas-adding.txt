Adding Aurora Replicas to a DB Cluster
In an Aurora DB cluster with single-master replication, there is one primary DB instance and up to 15 Aurora Replicas. The primary DB instance supports read and write operations, and performs all of the data modifications to the cluster volume. Aurora Replicas connect to the same storage volume as the primary DB instance and support only read operations. Aurora Replicas can offload read workloads from the primary DB instance. 
We recommend that you distribute the primary instance and Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster over multiple Availability Zones to improve the availability of your DB cluster. For more information, see Region Availability.
You can add Aurora Replicas to a DB cluster using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.
To remove an Aurora Replica from a DB cluster, delete the Aurora Replica DB instance by following the instructions in Deleting a DB Instance in an Aurora DB Cluster.
For more information about Aurora Replicas, see Aurora Replicas. 
Note
Amazon Aurora also supports replication with an external database, or an RDS DB instance. When using Amazon Aurora, your RDS DB instance must be in the same AWS Region. For more information, see Replication with Amazon Aurora.
Console
To add an Aurora Replica to a DB cluster


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.


In the navigation pane, choose Databases, and then select the DB cluster where you want to add the new DB instance. 


Make sure that both the cluster and the primary instance are in the Available state. If the DB cluster or the primary instance are in a transitional state such as Creating, you can't add a replica. 
If the cluster doesn't have a primary instance, create one using the create-db-instance AWS CLI command. This situation can arise if you used the CLI to restore a DB cluster snapshot and then view the cluster in the AWS Management Console.  


For Actions, choose Add reader. 


The Add reader page appears.


On the Add reader page, specify options for your Aurora Replica. The following table shows settings for an Aurora Replica.  
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Choose Add reader to create the Aurora Replica.


AWS CLI
To create an Aurora Replica in your DB cluster, run the create-db-instance AWS CLI command. Include the name of the DB cluster as the --db-cluster-identifier option. You can optionally specify an Availability Zone for the Aurora Replica using the --availability-zone parameter, as shown in the following examples.
For example, the following command creates a new MySQL 5.7–compatible Aurora Replica named sample-instance-us-west-2a.
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:
aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier sample-instance-us-west-2a \
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --engine aurora-mysql --db-instance-class db.r4.large \
    --availability-zone us-west-2a
For Windows:
aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier sample-instance-us-west-2a ^
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --engine aurora-mysql --db-instance-class db.r4.large ^
    --availability-zone us-west-2a
The following command creates a new MySQL 5.6–compatible Aurora Replica named sample-instance-us-west-2a.
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:
aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier sample-instance-us-west-2a \
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --engine aurora --db-instance-class db.r4.large \
    --availability-zone us-west-2a
For Windows:
aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier sample-instance-us-west-2a ^
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --engine aurora --db-instance-class db.r4.large ^
    --availability-zone us-west-2a
The following command creates a new PostgreSQL-compatible Aurora Replica named sample-instance-us-west-2a.
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:
aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier sample-instance-us-west-2a \
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --engine aurora-postgresql --db-instance-class db.r4.large \
    --availability-zone us-west-2a
For Windows:
aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier sample-instance-us-west-2a ^
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --engine aurora-postgresql --db-instance-class db.r4.large ^
    --availability-zone us-west-2a
RDS API
To create an Aurora Replica in your DB cluster, call the CreateDBInstance operation. Include the name of the DB cluster as the DBClusterIdentifier parameter. You can optionally specify an Availability Zone for the Aurora Replica using the AvailabilityZone parameter.
