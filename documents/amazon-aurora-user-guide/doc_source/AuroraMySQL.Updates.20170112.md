# Aurora MySQL Database Engine Updates: 2017\-01\-12<a name="AuroraMySQL.Updates.20170112"></a>

**Version:** 1\.10\.1

Version 1\.10\.1 of Aurora MySQL is an opt\-in version and is not used to patch your database instances\. It is available for creating new Aurora instances and for upgrading existing instances\. You can apply the patch by choosing a cluster in the [Amazon RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/), choosing **Cluster Actions**, and then choosing **Upgrade Now**\. Patching requires a database restart with downtime typically lasting 5\-30 seconds, after which you can resume using your DB clusters\. This patch is using a cluster patching model where all nodes in an Aurora cluster are patched at the same time\.

+ **Advanced Auditing** â€“ Aurora MySQL provides a high\-performance Advanced Auditing feature, which you can use to audit database activity\.
