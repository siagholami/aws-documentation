# Aurora MySQL Database Engine Updates 2018\-03\-23<a name="AuroraMySQL.Updates.1171"></a>

**Version:** 1\.17\.1

Aurora MySQL 1\.17\.1 is generally available\. All new database clusters, including those restored from snapshots, will be created in Aurora MySQL 1\.17\.1\. You have the option, but are not required, to upgrade existing database clusters to Aurora MySQL 1\.17\.1\. You can create new DB clusters in Aurora MySQL 1\.15\.1, Aurora MySQL 1\.16, or Aurora MySQL 1\.17\. You can do so using the AWS CLI or the Amazon RDS API and specifying the engine version\. 

With version 1\.17\.1 of Aurora MySQL, we are using a cluster patching model where all nodes in an Aurora DB cluster are patched at the same time\. This release fixes some known engine issues as well as regressions\. 

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through [AWS Premium Support](http://aws.amazon.com/support)\. For more information, see [Maintaining an Amazon Aurora DB Cluster](USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.md)\.

**Note**  
There is an issue in the latest version of the Aurora MySQL engine\. After upgrading to 1\.17\.1, the engine version is reported incorrectly as `1.17`\. If you upgraded to 1\.17\.1, you can confirm the upgrade by checking the **Maintenance** column for the DB cluster in the AWS Management Console\. If it displays `none`, then the engine is upgraded to 1\.17\.1\.
