# Aurora MySQL Database Engine Updates: 2016\-08\-30<a name="AuroraMySQL.Updates.20160830"></a>

**Version:** 1\.7\.0

## New Features<a name="AuroraMySQL.Updates.20160830.New"></a>
+ **NUMA aware scheduler** – The task scheduler for the Aurora MySQL engine is now Non\-Uniform Memory Access \(NUMA\) aware\. This minimizes cross\-CPU socket contention resulting in improved performance throughput for the `db.r3.8xlarge` DB instance class\.
+ **Parallel read\-ahead operates asynchronously in the background** – Parallel read\-ahead has been revised to improve performance by using a dedicated thread to reduce thread contention\.
+ **Improved index build \(lab mode\)** – The implementation for building secondary indexes now operates by building the index in a bottom\-up fashion, which eliminates unnecessary page splits\. This can reduce the time needed to create an index or rebuild a table\. This feature is disabled by default and can be activated by enabling Aurora lab mode\. For information, see [Amazon Aurora MySQL Lab Mode](AuroraMySQL.Updates.LabMode.md)\.

## Improvements<a name="AuroraMySQL.Updates.20160830.Improvements"></a>
+ Fixed an issue where establishing a connection was taking a long time if there was a surge in the number of connections requested for an instance\.
+ Fixed an issue where a crash occurred if ALTER TABLE was run on a partitioned table that did not use InnoDB\.
+ Fixed an issue where heavy write workload can cause a failover\.
+ Fixed an erroneous assertion that caused a failure if RENAME TABLE was run on a partitioned table\.
+ Improved stability when rolling back a transaction during insert\-heavy workload\.
+ Fixed an issue where full\-text search indexes were not viable on an Aurora Replica\.

## Integration of MySQL Bug Fixes<a name="AuroraMySQL.Updates.20160830.BugFixes"></a>
