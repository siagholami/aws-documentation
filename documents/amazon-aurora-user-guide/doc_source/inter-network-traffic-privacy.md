# Internetwork Traffic Privacy<a name="inter-network-traffic-privacy"></a>

Connections are protected both between Amazon Aurora and on\-premises applications and between Amazon Aurora and other AWS resources within the same AWS Region\.

## Traffic Between Service and On\-Premises Clients and Applications<a name="inter-network-traffic-privacy-on-prem"></a>

You have two connectivity options between your private network and AWS: 
+ An AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN connection\. For more information, see [What is AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html)
+ An AWS Direct Connect connection\. For more information, see [What is AWS Direct Connect?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)

You get access to Amazon Aurora through the network by using AWS\-published API operations\. Clients must support Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) 1\.0\. We recommend TLS 1\.2\. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy \(PFS\), such as Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(DHE\) or Elliptic Curve Diffie\-Hellman Ephemeral \(ECDHE\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\. Additionally, you must sign requests using an access key identifier and a secret access key that are associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service \(STS\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.
