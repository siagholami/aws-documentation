# Using SSL/TLS to Encrypt a Connection to a DB Cluster<a name="UsingWithRDS.SSL"></a>

You can use Secure Socket Layer \(SSL\) or Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) from your application to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster running Aurora MySQL or Aurora PostgreSQL\. Each DB engine has its own process for implementing SSL/TLS\. To learn how to implement SSL/TLS for your DB cluster, use the link following that corresponds to your DB engine: 
+ [Security with Amazon Aurora MySQL](AuroraMySQL.Security.md)
+ [Security with Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL](AuroraPostgreSQL.Security.md)

**Important**  
For information about rotating your certificate, see [Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate](UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.md)\.

**Note**  
All certificates are only available for download using SSL/TLS connections\.

To get a root certificate that works for all AWS Regions, excluding opt\-in AWS Regions, download it from [ https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/rds\-downloads/rds\-ca\-2019\-root\.pem](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-ca-2019-root.pem)\.

This root certificate is a trusted root entity and should work in most cases but might fail if your application doesn't accept certificate chains\. If your application doesn't accept certificate chains, download the AWS Region–specific certificate from the list of intermediate certificates found later in this section\.

To get a certificate bundle that contains both the intermediate and root certificates, download from [ https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/rds\-downloads/rds\-combined\-ca\-bundle\.pem](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem)\. 

If your application is on Microsoft Windows and requires a PKCS7 file, you can download the PKCS7 certificate bundle\. This bundle contains both the intermediate and root certificates at [ https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/rds\-downloads/rds\-combined\-ca\-bundle\.p7b](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.p7b)\. 

**Note**  
Amazon RDS Proxy and Aurora Serverless use certificates from the AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\)\. If you are using RDS Proxy, you don't need to download Amazon RDS certificates or update applications that use RDS Proxy connections\. For more information about using TLS/SSL with RDS Proxy, see [Using TLS/SSL with RDS Proxy](rds-proxy.md#rds-proxy-security.tls)\.  
If you are Aurora Serverless, downloading Amazon RDS certificates isn't required\. For more information about using TLS/SSL with Aurora Serverless, see [Using TLS/SSL with Aurora Serverless](aurora-serverless.md#aurora-serverless.tls)\.

## Root Certificates for Opt\-In AWS Regions<a name="UsingWithRDS.SSL.RootCertificatesOptIn"></a>

If you are using an opt\-in AWS Region, you can download the root certificate from the following table\.


| **Opt\-In AWS Region** | **Root Certificate** | 
| --- | --- | 
| Africa \(Cape Town\) | [rds\-ca\-af\-south\-1\-2019\-root\.pem](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-ca-af-south-1-2019-root.pem) | 
| Asia Pacific \(Hong Kong\) | [rds\-ca\-ap\-east\-1\-2019\-root\.pem](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-ca-ap-east-1-2019-root.pem) |

| Middle East \(Bahrain\) | [rds\-ca\-me\-south\-1\-2019\-root\.pem](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-ca-me-south-1-2019-root.pem) | 

## Intermediate Certificates<a name="UsingWithRDS.SSL.IntermediateCertificates"></a>

You might need to use an intermediate certificate to connect to your AWS Region\. For example, you must use an intermediate certificate to connect to the AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\) Region using SSL/TLS\. If you need an intermediate certificate for a particular AWS Region, download the certificate from the following table\.


| **AWS Region** | **Intermediate Certificate** | 
| --- | --- | 
| Asia Pacific \(Mumbai\) | [rds\-ca\-2019\-ap\-south\-1\.pem](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-ca-2019-ap-south-1.pem) |
