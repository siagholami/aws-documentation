+ [Migrating Data from a MySQL DB Instance to an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB Cluster by Using an Aurora Read Replica](AuroraMySQL.Migrating.RDSMySQL.Replica.md)

**Note**  
Because Amazon Aurora MySQL is compatible with MySQL, you can migrate data from your MySQL database by setting up replication between your MySQL database and an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster\. If you want to use replication to migrate data from your MySQL database, we recommend that your MySQL database run MySQL version 5\.5 or later\. For more information, see [Replication with Amazon Aurora](Aurora.Replication.md)\.
