Enabling and Disabling Performance Insights
To use Performance Insights, enable it on your DB instance. If needed, you can disable it later. Enabling and disabling Performance Insights doesn't cause downtime, a reboot, or a failover.
If you use Performance Insights together with Aurora Global Database, enable Performance Insights individually for the DB instances in each AWS Region. For details, see Performance Insights for Aurora Global Databases. 
The Performance Insights agent consumes limited CPU and memory on the DB host. When the DB load is high, the agent limits the performance impact by collecting data less frequently.
Console
In the console, you can enable or disable Performance Insights when you create or modify a new DB instance.
Enabling or Disabling Performance Insights When Creating an Instance
When you create a new DB instance, enable Performance Insights by choosing Enable Performance Insights in the Performance Insights section. Or choose Disable Performance Insights.
To create a DB instance, follow the instructions for your DB engine in Creating an Amazon Aurora DB Cluster.
The following screenshot shows the Performance Insights section.

If you choose Enable Performance Insights, you have the following options:
 Retention – The amount of time to retain Performance Insights data. Choose either 7 days (the default) or 2 years.
 Master key – Specify your AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). Performance Insights encrypts all potentially sensitive data using your AWS KMS CMK. Data is encrypted in flight and at rest. For more information, see Encrypting Amazon Aurora Resources.
Enabling or Disabling Performance Insights When Modifying an Instance
In the console, you can modify a DB instance to enable or disable Performance Insights using the console.
To enable or disable Performance Insights for a DB instance using the console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.


Choose Databases.


Choose a DB instance, and choose Modify.


In the Performance Insights section, choose either Enable Performance Insights or Disable Performance Insights.


If you choose Enable Performance Insights, you have the following options:
    Retention – The amount of time to retain Performance Insights data. Choose either 7 days (the default) or 2 years.
    Master key – Specify your AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). Performance Insights encrypts all potentially sensitive data using your AWS KMS CMK. Data is encrypted in flight and at rest. For more information, see Encrypting Amazon Aurora Resources.


Choose Continue.


For Scheduling of Modifications, choose one of the following:
    Apply during the next scheduled maintenance window – Wait to apply the Performance Insights modification until the next maintenance window.
    Apply immediately – Apply the Performance Insights modification as soon as possible.


Choose Modify instance.


AWS CLI
When you use the create-db-instance AWS CLI command, enable Performance Insights by specifying --enable-performance-insights. Or disable Performance Insights by specifying --no-enable-performance-insights.
You can also specify these values using the following AWS CLI commands:
  create-db-instance-read-replica 
  modify-db-instance 
  restore-db-instance-from-s3 
The following procedure describes how to enable or disable Performance Insights for a DB instance using the AWS CLI.
To enable or disable Performance Insights for a DB instance using the AWS CLI
 Call the modify-db-instance AWS CLI command and supply the following values:
   --db-instance-identifier – The name of the DB instance.
   --enable-performance-insights to enable or --no-enable-performance-insights to disable
The following example enables Performance Insights for sample-db-instance.
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:
aws rds modify-db-instance \
      --db-instance-identifier sample-db-instance \
      --enable-performance-insights
For Windows:
aws rds modify-db-instance ^
      --db-instance-identifier sample-db-instance ^
      --enable-performance-insights
When you enable Performance Insights, you can optionally specify the amount of time, in days, to retain Performance Insights data with the --performance-insights-retention-period option. Valid values are 7 (the default) or 731 (2 years).
The following example enables Performance Insights for sample-db-instance and specifies that Performance Insights data is retained for two years.
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:
aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier sample-db-instance \
    --enable-performance-insights \
    --performance-insights-retention-period 731
For Windows:
aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier sample-db-instance ^
    --enable-performance-insights ^
    --performance-insights-retention-period 731
RDS API
When you create a new DB instance using the CreateDBInstance operation Amazon RDS API operation, enable Performance Insights by setting EnablePerformanceInsights to True. To disable Performance Insights, set EnablePerformanceInsights to False.
You can also specify the EnablePerformanceInsights value using the following API operations:
  ModifyDBInstance 
  CreateDBInstanceReadReplica 
  RestoreDBInstanceFromS3 
When you enable Performance Insights, you can optionally specify the amount of time, in days, to retain Performance Insights data with the PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod parameter. Valid values are 7 (the default) or 731 (2 years).
Enabling the Performance Schema for Performance Insights on Aurora MySQL
When the Performance Schema feature is enabled for Aurora MySQL, Performance Insights provides more detailed information. For example, Performance Insights displays DB load categorized by detailed wait events. Without the Performance Schema enabled, Performance Insights displays DB load categorized by the list state of the MySQL process.
Performance Schema is enabled automatically when you create an Aurora MySQL DB instance with Performance Insights enabled. In this case, Performance Insights automatically manages the parameters in the following table.
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
Important
When Performance Schema is enabled automatically, Performance Insights changes schema-related parameters on the DB instance. These changes aren't visible in the parameter group associated with the DB instance.
For more information, see Performance Schema Command Options and Performance Schema Option and Variable Reference in the MySQL documentation.
