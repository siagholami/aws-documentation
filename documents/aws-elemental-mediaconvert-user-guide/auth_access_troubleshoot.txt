I'm not authorized to perform an action in AWS Elemental MediaConvert
If you receive an error in the AWS Management Console that tells you that you're not authorized to perform an action, then you must contact the administrator that provided you with your user name and password. 
The following example error occurs when an IAM user named my-user-name tries to use the console to perform the GetJob action, but does not have permissions:
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/my-user-name is not authorized to perform: MediaConvert:GetJob on resource: my-example-job-arn
For this error, ask your administrator to update your policies to allow you to access the my-example-job-arn resource using the MediaConvert:GetJob action.
I'm an administrator and want to allow others to access AWS Elemental MediaConvert
To allow others to access AWS Elemental MediaConvert, you must create an IAM entity (user or role) for the person or application that needs access. They will use the credentials for that entity to access AWS. You must then attach a policy to the entity that grants them the correct permissions in MediaConvert.
