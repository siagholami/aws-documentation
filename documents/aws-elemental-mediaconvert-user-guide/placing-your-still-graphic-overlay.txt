Placing your still graphic overlay
Regardless of whether you specify a still graphic overlay in an input or an output, you set up when it starts and how long it runs by specifying the Start time and Duration. The following image shows how you would specify these settings if you wanted your overlay to start two minutes into the video and to remain on the video for two minutes. If you keep these settings in their default state, the overlay will begin at the first frame of the input or output and remain on the video for the duration of the input or output.

Start time
Provide the timecode for the first frame that you want to have the overlay appear on. If you set up your overlay to fade in, the fade-in begins at the start time.
Make sure that you take the right timeline into account when you provide your start time. This depends on which overlay you're using:
 For input overlays, Start time is relative to the input timeline. This timeline is affected by the input Timecode source setting.
 For output overlays, Start time is relative to the output timeline. This timeline is affected by the job-wide Timecode configuration, Source setting.
For more information about the input and output timelines, and the timecode settings that affect them, see How MediaConvert uses timelines to assemble jobs.
Tip
For simplest setup, specify Start time counting from 00:00:00:00 as the first frame, and set both of the following settings to Start at 0:
Timecode configuration, Source, under the job-wide settings.
Timecode source, in the Video selector settings for each input.
Duration
Specify the length of time, in milliseconds, that you want the overlay to remain for. This duration includes fade-in time, but not fade-out time, as the following image shows.
