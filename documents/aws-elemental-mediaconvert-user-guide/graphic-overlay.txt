Using image inserter (graphic overlay) in AWS Elemental MediaConvert
The image inserter (graphic overlay) feature lets you insert a still image or motion graphic at a specified time and display it as an overlay on the underlying video for a specified duration. This feature includes fade-in and fade-out capability and adjustable opacity.
You can set up an output with multiple overlays. For example, you might include a motion graphic logo in the corner of the video frame throughout the duration of the video, and a still image HDR indicator for only the portions of the file that are HDR. Each overlay is independent of the others, with its own settings for opacity, fade-in and fade-out times, position on the frame, and the length of time that it is on the video. You can set up overlays so that they all appear on the underlying video at the same time and physically overlap each other.
