Creating an AWS Elemental MediaConvert job by duplicating a completed job
To create a job that is similar to one that you ran before, you can duplicate a completed job from your job history, and then modify any settings that you need to change.
To create a job based on a recently completed job


Open the MediaConvert console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert.


On the navigation bar of the MediaConvert console, choose the Region where the completed job was created.


Completed jobs appear only in the Region where they are created.



Choose the three-bar icon on the left to access the left navigation pane.


Choose Jobs to display the Jobs page.
Tip
Optionally, from the Status dropdown list, choose Complete to filter your list of jobs to just those that finished successfully.


On the Jobs page, from the Job ID column of the job history, choose the job that you want to duplicate.


On the Job summary page, choose the Duplicate button.


Modify any settings that you want to be different in the new job.


For more information about each setting, choose the Info link located next to the setting or next to the heading for the group of settings.
Tip
Settings that are likely to change from job to job include the following: input file location, output destination locations, and output name modifiers. If you are running transcoding jobs for customers of yours who have different AWS accounts from your account, you also must change the IAM role under Job settings.

Choose the Create button at the bottom of the page.
