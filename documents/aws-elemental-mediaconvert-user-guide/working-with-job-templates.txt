Working with AWS Elemental MediaConvert job templates
Job templates speed up your job setup by providing groups of recommended transcoding settings. Job templates apply to an entire transcoding job; output presets apply to a single output of a transcoding job. For more about output presets, see Working with output presets.
You can use a system job template with settings specified for you, or you can create a custom job template with your own settings. You can create a custom job template from scratch, starting with only the default settings. Or you can duplicate a system job template, adjust it to suit your workflow, and then save it as a custom job template.
