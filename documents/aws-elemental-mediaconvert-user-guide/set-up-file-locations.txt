Step 2: Create storage for files
AWS Elemental MediaConvert transcodes your input files to generate output files. MediaConvert can take in your input files from Amazon S3 or from a server through HTTP or HTTPS. For your output locations, MediaConvert works with Amazon S3 buckets.
To create an Amazon S3 bucket


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


On the Amazon S3 console, choose Create bucket.


In the Create bucket dialog box, type a bucket name. If you want to create separate input and output buckets, give the bucket an appropriate name that will help you identify it later.


Choose a Region for your bucket. Make sure that you create your Amazon S3 buckets and do your MediaConvert transcoding in the same Region.


Choose Create.


If you want to create separate buckets for your input files and output files, repeat steps 2 through step 5.
