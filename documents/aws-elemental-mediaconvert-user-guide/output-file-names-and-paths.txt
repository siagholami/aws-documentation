Output file names and paths
The CloudWatch Events job COMPLETE notification includes the JobResult response in JSON. This information includes the file names and paths for the outputs of the jobâ€”including manifests as well as the media assets.
The files that AWS Elemental MediaConvert creates depends on the output groups that you set up in the job. For example, DASH ISO packages contain an .mpd manifest and .mp4 media fragment files.
You can find output file name and path information in the JobResult response information, in the following properties:
playlistFilePaths
A list of the Amazon S3 file paths to the top-level manifests.
outputFilePaths
The file path to either the media or the manifest, depending on the output group type.
type
The type of output group, which determines what files are listed in the playlistFilePaths and outputFilePaths.
The following table summarizes the values for these properties, depending on the output group type.
