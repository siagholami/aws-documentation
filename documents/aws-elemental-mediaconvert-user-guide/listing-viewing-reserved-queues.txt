Listing and viewing reserved queues in AWS Elemental MediaConvert
You can list the AWS Elemental MediaConvert queues that are associated with your AWS account and view the details about those queues. The following procedure explains how to do so using the MediaConvert console.
To list queues and view queue settings


Open the MediaConvert console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert.


On the navigation bar of the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console, choose the Region where you created the queues that you want to view.
