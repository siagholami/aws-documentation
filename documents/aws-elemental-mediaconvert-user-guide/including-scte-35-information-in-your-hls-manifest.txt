Including SCTE-35 information in your HLS manifest
For outputs in an HLS package, you can have the service include information in the HLS manifest about the SCTE-35 markers that are in each of the outputs.
To include SCTE-35 information in your HLS manifest (console)


Open the MediaConvert console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert.


Choose Create new job.


Set up your input, output groups, and outputs for video and audio, following the procedure in Passing through SCTE-35 markers from your input or Specifying SCTE-35 markers using ESAM XML.


Enable ad markers in each of your Apple HLS output groups.


In the Job pane on the left, under Output groups, choose Apple HLS.


In the Apple HLS group settings section, choose Advanced.


Choose Container settings, then scroll down to find the PID controls section.


In the Ad markers section, choose one or both of Elemental and SCTE-35 enhanced. 
For sample manifests created with each setting selected, see Sample manifest: Elemental ad markers and Sample manifest: SCTE-35 enhanced ad markers.


If the source of your ad markers is an ESAM document, set these additional settings:


Make sure that you entered XML for Manifest confirm condition notification XML during the procedure in Specifying SCTE-35 markers using ESAM XML.
When you want SCTE-35 markers in the output transport stream as well as in the manifest, use dataPassThrough attributes set to "true". When you don't want markers in the transport stream, don't include dataPassThrough attributes.


For each output in each of your Apple HLS output groups, set SCTE-35 source to Passthrough.


In the Job pane on the left, under Output groups, Apple HLS, choose an output.


In the Output settings section, choose Transport stream settings.


For SCTE-35 source, choose Passthrough.
