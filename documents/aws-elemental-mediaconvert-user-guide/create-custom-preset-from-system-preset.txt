Creating a custom preset based on a system preset in MediaConvert
MediaConvert doesn't allow you to modify system presets. If you want a preset that is like a system preset but slightly modified, you can duplicate the system preset, customize the settings, and save it as a custom preset.
To create a custom output preset based on a system preset


Open the MediaConvert console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert.


On the navigation bar of the MediaConvert console, choose the region where you want to create the new preset.


System presets are available in all regions. Custom presets appear only in the region where you created them.



Choose the three-bar icon on the left to access the left navigation pane.


Choose Output presets.


In the Output presets pane, from the Presets dropdown list, choose System presets.


Choose the name of the system preset that is most like the custom preset that you want to create.


On the Preset details page, choose Duplicate.


On the Create preset page, specify a name for the new preset. Optionally, modify the description and category.


These values help you find the custom preset later if you list your presets and use the search function on the Output presets pane.

Modify any output settings.

For more information about each setting, choose the Info link that is located next to the setting or next to the heading for the group of settings.

Choose the Create button at the bottom of the page.
Note
This button looks like the Create button for creating a job, but in this context, choosing it creates the custom preset.
