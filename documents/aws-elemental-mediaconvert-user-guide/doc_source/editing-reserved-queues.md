# Editing reserved queues in AWS Elemental MediaConvert<a name="editing-reserved-queues"></a>

When you edit a queue, you can change the following:
+ The description, which helps you identify it in the queue dashboard\.
+ The auto renew status of the queue's pricing plan for reserved transcode slots \(RTS\)\. For more information, see [How you pay for transcoding with reserved queues](about-reserved-queues.md#how-you-pay-for-reserved-queues)\.
+ The paused or active status of the queue\. Pausing the queue prevents the service from starting any more jobs until you reactivate the queue\.
