# Working with AWS Elemental MediaConvert output presets<a name="working-with-presets"></a>

Output presets speed up your job setup by providing groups of recommended transcoding settings\. Job templates apply to an entire transcoding job; output presets apply to a single output of a transcoding job\. For more information about job templates, see [Working with job templates](working-with-job-templates.md)\.

You can use a system preset with settings specified for you, or you can create a custom preset with your own settings\. You can create a custom preset from scratch, starting with only the default settings, or you can duplicate a system preset, adjust it to suit your workflow, and then save it as a custom preset\.
