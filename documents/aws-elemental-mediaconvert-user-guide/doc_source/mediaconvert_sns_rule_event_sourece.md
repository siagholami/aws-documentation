# Step 2: Specify an event source in a CloudWatch Events rule<a name="mediaconvert_sns_rule_event_sourece"></a>

Next, specify your event source in a CloudWatch Events rule to capture only events that are generated by a job status that changes to `ERROR`\. 

![\[This CloudWatch Events rule brings together a job event that has an error and an Amazon SNS topic. The CloudWatch Events rule is represented by a rectangle that reads "Rule: Send me an email when one of my jobs has an error." Inside that rectangle are two rectangles, one representing the target and one representing the event source. In this image, the event source rectangle is highlighted. It reads "Event Source: AWS Elemental MediaConvert says one of my jobs has an error."\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/images/CloudWatchEvents_tutorial-eventsource.png)

**To set up an event source in a CloudWatch Events rule**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Events**, and then choose **Create rule**\.

1. In the **Event Source** section, choose **Event Pattern**, and then choose the element labeled **Build event pattern to match events by service**\. From the resulting dropdown list, choose **Custom event pattern**\.

1. In the **Build custom event pattern** box, replace the existing code with the following code: 

   ```
   {
   "source": [
   "aws.mediaconvert"
   ],
   "detail": {
   "status": [
   "ERROR"
   ]
   }
   }
   ```

   This code defines a CloudWatch Events event rule that matches any event where the job status changes to `ERROR`\. For more information about event patterns, see [Events and event patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CloudWatchEventsandEventPatterns.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
