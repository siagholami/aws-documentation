# Optional: Pause your queues<a name="optional-pause-the-queue"></a>

If you are just getting started with AWS Elemental MediaConvert or are experimenting with the MediaConvert console, you might want to pause your queues to avoid accidentally starting a job before you're ready\. For more information about queues, see [Working with queues](working-with-queues.md)\.

**To pause or reactivate an on\-demand queue**

1. Open the MediaConvert console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/mediaconvert](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert)\.

1. If you are pausing or reactivating a queue other than the default queue, on the navigation bar of the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console, choose the Region where you created the queue\.

   The default queue is available in all Regions\. Other queues appear only in the Region where you create them\.
