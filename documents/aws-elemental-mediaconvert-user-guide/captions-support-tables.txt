Captions supported by AWS Elemental MediaConvert
MediaConvert supports a wide range of captions conversion workflows. But you can't convert every supported input captions format to every supported output captions format. Each video container supports a subset of all possible captions types. Furthermore, MediaConvert supports a subset of all transformations theoretically allowed within the input and output video container type.
To look up whether MediaConvert supports your captions workflow, consult the table that corresponds with your output video container type in , find the row for your input captions container and input captions format. Check the supported output captions format column to see the available output captions formats.
