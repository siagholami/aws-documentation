Editing reserved queues in AWS Elemental MediaConvert
When you edit a queue, you can change the following:
 The description, which helps you identify it in the queue dashboard.
 The auto renew status of the queue's pricing plan for reserved transcode slots (RTS). For more information, see How you pay for transcoding with reserved queues.
 The paused or active status of the queue. Pausing the queue prevents the service from starting any more jobs until you reactivate the queue.
