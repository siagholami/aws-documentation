Adjusting the input timeline with the input timecode source
The value for Timecode source that you specify in an input's settings affects the input timeline for that input. For information about which features are affected by the input timeline, see Input timelines.
To adjust the input Timecode source setting (console)


On the Create job page, in the Job pane on the left, choose an input.


Under Video selector, Timecode source, specify whether MediaConvert reads timecodes from the input or generates them. MediaConvert can generate timecodes starting from zero or from a starting timecode that you specify. Here are the options for Timecode source:
    Embedded: The service uses any timecodes embedded in the input video. This is the default value. 
Note
Don't choose this value unless your input video has embedded timecodes.
    Start at 0: The service sets the timecode of the first frame of the input to 00:00:00:00.
    Specified start: The service sets the timecode of the first frame of the input to the value that you specify in the setting Start timecode.


Regardless of the source, timecodes are in the following 24-hour format with a frame number: HH:MM:SS:FF.
To adjust the input TimecodeSource (Timecode source) setting (API, SDK, and AWS CLI)
 In your JSON job specification, set a value for TimecodeSource, located in Settings, Inputs.
Choose a value for TimecodeSource as follows:
   EMBEDDED: The service uses any timecodes embedded in the input video. This is the default value. 
Note
Don't choose this value unless your input video has embedded timecodes.
   ZEROBASED: The service sets the timecode of the first frame of the input to 00:00:00:00.
   SPECIFIEDSTART: The service sets the timecode of the first frame of the input to the value that you specify in the setting Start timecode.
