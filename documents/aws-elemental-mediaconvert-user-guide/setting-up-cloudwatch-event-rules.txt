Setting up CloudWatch Events rules
To set up CloudWatch Events rules, you create a rule that links AWS Elemental MediaConvert and the service that responds to your job status change, such as Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) or AWS Lambda. The following illustration shows these two parts of CloudWatch Events rules.
