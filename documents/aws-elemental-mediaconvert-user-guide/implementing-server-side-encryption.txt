Implementing server-side encryption
Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 is one of the three encryption options that you can use with AWS Elemental MediaConvert. You can use it in conjunction with the other two options. The following illustration shows the three options.

You can protect your input and output files at rest by using server-side encryption with Amazon S3: 
 To protect your input files, set up server-side encryption as you would for any object in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Protecting data using server-side encryption in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
 To protect your output files, specify in your AWS Elemental MediaConvert job that Amazon S3 encrypts your output files as MediaConvert uploads them. By default, your output files are not encrypted. The rest of this topic provides more information about setting up your job to encrypt your output files.
When you set up an AWS Elemental MediaConvert job output for server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts it with a data key. As an additional security measure, the data key itself is encrypted with a master key.
You choose whether Amazon S3 encrypts the data key by using the default S3 master key or a customer master key that is managed by AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Using the default S3 master key is simplest to set up. If you prefer more control over your master key, use an AWS KMS customer master key. For more information about the different types of CMKs managed with AWS KMS, see Customer master keys (CMKs) in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
If you choose to use an AWS KMS CMK, you can specify a customer managed CMK in your AWS account. Otherwise, AWS KMS uses the AWS managed CMK for S3, which has the alias aws/s3.
To set up your job outputs for server-side encryption


Open the MediaConvert console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert.


Choose Create job.


Set up your input, output groups, and outputs for video and audio, as described in Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert and Structuring complex jobs in AWS Elemental MediaConvert.


For each output group that has outputs that you want encrypted, set up server-side encryption:


In the Job pane on the left, choose the output group.


In the group settings section on the right, choose Server-side encryption. If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job. The setting name is S3EncryptionSettings.


For Encryption key management, choose the AWS service that protects your data key. If you use the API or an SDK, you can find this setting in the JSON file of your job. The setting name is S3ServerSideEncryptionType.
If you choose Amazon S3, Amazon S3 encrypts your data key with a master key that Amazon S3 stores securely. If you choose AWS KMS, Amazon S3 encrypts your data key with a CMK that AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) stores and manages.


If you chose AWS KMS in the preceding step, optionally specify the ARN of one of your customer managed CMKs. If you do, AWS KMS will use that CMK to encrypt the data key that Amazon S3 uses to encrypt your media files. 
If you don't specify a CMK for AWS KMS, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in your AWS account that is used exclusively for Amazon S3.


If you chose AWS KMS for Encryption key management, grant kms:Encrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey permissions to your AWS Elemental MediaConvert AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. This allows MediaConvert to encrypt your output files. If you also want to be able to use these outputs as inputs to another MediaConvert job, also grant kms:Decrypt permissions. To learn more, see these topics:

For more information about setting up an IAM role for AWS Elemental MediaConvert to assume, see Step 3: Set up IAM permissions  in the Getting Started chapter of this guide.
For more information about granting IAM permissions using an inline policy, see the procedure To embed an inline policy for a user or role in Adding IAM identity permissions (Console) in the IAM User Guide. 
For examples of IAM policies that grant AWS KMS permissions, including decrypting encrypted content, see Customer managed policy examples in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.



Run your AWS Elemental MediaConvert job as usual. If you chose AWS KMS for Encryption key management, remember to grant kms:Decrypt permissions to any user or role that you want to be able to access your outputs.
