Setting up still graphic overlays in outputs
Because you are setting up an output overlay, set up image insertion in each output where you want the service to overlay graphics on your video. For information about setting up an overlay that appears on all outputs or on portions that correspond to only one input, see Choosing between input overlay and output overlay.
If you don't specify overlay start time and duration, the service puts the overlay on the entire output.
To set up a still graphic overlay in an output


Open the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert.


Set up your output groups and outputs for video and audio, as described in Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert and Structuring complex jobs in AWS Elemental MediaConvert.


For each output that you want to have a graphic overlay, do the following:


On the Create job page, in the Job pane on the left, under Output groups, choose the appropriate output.


Under Encoding settings, under the Video tab, find the Preprocessors section.


Choose Image inserter. This displays an Add image button.


For each graphic overlay that you want to include in the output, choose Add image, and then specify the overlay settings.
For Image location, specify an input file that is stored in Amazon S3 or on an HTTP(S) server. For Amazon S3 inputs, you can specify the URI directly or choose Browse to select from your Amazon S3 buckets. For HTTP(S) inputs, provide the URL to your input video file. For more information, see HTTP input requirements.
