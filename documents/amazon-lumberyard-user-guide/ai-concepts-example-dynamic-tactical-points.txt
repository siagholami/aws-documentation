Individual AI: Tactical Points
Example: A very shy civilian who always wants to hide from the player
 Tactical point system (TPS) query:
AI.RegisterTacticalPointQuery({
      Name = "Civilian_HideFromEnemy",
      {
          Generation =
          {
              cover_from_attentionTarget_around_puppet = 25
          },
              Conditions =
          {
              reachable = true,
          },
          Weights =
          {
              distance_from_puppet = -1,
          },
      },
  });
 Useful AI debug draw: 
   ai_DebugTacticalPoints=1
   ai_StatsTarget=Grunt1
   ai_TacticalPointsDebugTime=10
