Random Timed Spawner

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
You can use the Random Timed Spawner component to spawn a specified dynamic slice. The component spawns the slice at a specified interval (and random interval variation) to a random position inside of a specified volume.
The Random Timed Spawner component requires that the following components are also attached to the entity:
 Spawner component – Manages the spawning of the slice.
 Box Shape or Cylinder Shape component – Defines the volume of possible positions where the entities can spawn.
With these components, you can control the random distribution that determines the random points inside the volume.
Currently, you can specify how entities spawn in random positions with the following random distribution types:
 Normal distribution
 Uniform Real distribution
The Random Timed Spawner component is part of the LmbrCentral gem. For more information, see Add modular features and assets with Gems.
Example
The following Random Timed Spawner component has the distribution type, Uniform Real.

Random Timed Spawner Properties
Enabled
Enables slices to spawn with the specified parameters. 
Default value: True
Random Distribution
Specify the random distribution type when the Random Timed Spawner component creates random spawn positions.
Default value: Uniform Real
Valid values: Normal, Uniform Real
Timing
Spawn Delay
Time between spawns, in seconds.
If the Enabled parameter is true, a value of 2.0 means that every two seconds after the Random Timed Spawner component is activated, a spawn is triggered.
Default value: 5.0
Valid values: -∞ to ∞
Spawn Delay Variation
Amount of random variation to apply to the spawn delay.
For example, a value of 1.0 and a Spawn Delay value of 2.0 means that the range of possible spawn times is (2.0 /– 1.0) or between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds.
Default value: 0
Valid values: -∞ to ∞
EBus Request Bus Interface
You can use this EBus to communicate to an entity with a Random Timed Spawner component attached. The EBus is available at game run time and editing and can be accessed from C, Lua, and the Script Canvas editor.
For more information about using the event bus (EBus) interface, see Working with the Event Bus (EBus) system.
Enable
Starts random spawning.
Parameters
None
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
Disable
Stops random spawning.
Parameters
None
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
Toggle
Toggles random spawning.
Parameters
None
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
IsEnabled
Returns whether the Random Timed Spawner component is spawning entities.
Parameters
None
Return
Type: Boolean
Scriptable
Yes
SetRandomDistribution
Sets the type of random distribution that determines where the Random Timed Spawner component places the entities that spawn.
Parameters
Type: AZ::RandomDistributionType
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
GetRandomDistribution
Returns the type of random distribution for the Random Timed Spawner component.
Note
In Lua, this value is returned as a number: 
0 – Normal distribution
1 – Uniform Real distribution
Parameters
None
Return
Type: AZ::RandomDistributionType
Scriptable
Yes
SetSpawnDelay
Sets the time between entity spawns, in seconds.
Parameters
Type: Double
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
GetSpawnDelay
Returns the time between entity spawns, in seconds.
Parameters
None
Return
Type: Double
Scriptable
Yes
SetSpawnDelayVariation
Sets the random variation in spawn delay, in seconds.
The Random Timed Spawner component uses the specified value to calculate a random value that is added to the Spawn Delay parameter. 
For example, a SpawnDelayVariation value of 1.0 and a Spawn Delay value of 2.0 means that the range of possible spawn times is (2.0 /– 1.0) or between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds.
For more information, see Timing.
Parameters
Type: Double
Return
None
Scriptable
Yes
GetSpawnDelayVariation
Returns the random variation in spawn delay, in seconds.
Parameters
None
Return
Type: Double
Scriptable
Yes
Notification Bus Example Script
function example:OnActivate()
    RandomTimedSpawnerComponentRequestBus.Event.SetSpawnDelay(self.entityId, 0.5)
    RandomTimedSpawnerComponentRequestBus.Event.SetSpawnDelayVariation(self.entityId, 0.03)
end
