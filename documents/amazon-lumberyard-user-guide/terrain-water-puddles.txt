Adding Water Puddles

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
To create realistic water puddles and water rifts, use non-tiling textures that can be placed as decals. While water puddles could be created as a water volume, using decals is less demanding on resources. For more information on decals, see Working with Decals.
For proper blending between the water puddle and the terrain, use an alpha channel with a smooth gradient so it fades into the terrain and the transition won't be noticeable.
