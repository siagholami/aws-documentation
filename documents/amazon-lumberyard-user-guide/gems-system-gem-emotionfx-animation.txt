EMotion FX Animation Gem
With the EMotion FX Animation gem, you can use the EMotion FX Animation Editor character animation system. The node-based system provides an intuitive approach to controlling character behavior from animation graphs. You can visually build hierarchal state machines and blend trees and use parameter controls for interactive testing. Character motion is controlled through motion extraction.
The character animation system includes tools for building the following:
 Transition conditions
 Blend spaces
 Sync tracking
 Motion events
 Mirroring animation
 Controllers
The Animation Editor is compatible with .fbx files and converts these files to the .actor and .motion formats.
