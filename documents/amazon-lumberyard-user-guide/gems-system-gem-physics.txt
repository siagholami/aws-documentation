Physics Entities Gem

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
The Physics Entities Gem is a collection of physics entities used to simulate physical events such as explosions, gravity fields, or wind, or to physicalize objects such as cloth, breakable entities, or ropes. Physical entities that are related to a body instead of an event are connected to an object.
To access the Physics entities


In the Rollup Bar, on the Objects tab, choose Entity.
