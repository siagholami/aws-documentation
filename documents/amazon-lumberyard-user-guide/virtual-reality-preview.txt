Previewing your Virtual Reality Project
You can preview your virtual reality project for any project that has one or more of the virtual reality head-mounted display gems enabled. As you work in Lumberyard Editor, use your head-mounted display to preview your virtual reality game. The preview display inside of Lumberyard Editor is a preview only; it is not a good indicator of how fast the application will perform outside of the editor.
To gauge the game performance outside of Lumberyard Editor, create a release build to run your game in standalone mode.
To preview your virtual reality project


In Lumberyard Editor, click VR Preview on the bottom toolbar.



Enter game mode by doing one of the following:
    Press Ctrl  G
    On the main menu, click Game, Play Game.


To exit virtual reality preview mode


Exit game mode by pressing Esc.


Click VR Preview if you want to return to the default PC game preview mode.
