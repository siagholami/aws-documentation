Reflecting Lumberyard Classes, Methods, and EBus Interfaces
You can use Lumberyard's reflection system to expose runtime code for C-based objects, for Lumberyard Editor, and for scripting.
Lumberyard provides the following reflection contexts for these purposes:
 Serialization Context – Provides persistence for C based objects through reflection for serialization.
 Edit Context – Enhances the serialization context to enable manipulation of data by Lumberyard Editor.
 Behavior Context – Provides reflection for Lumberyard's Script Canvas and for scripting languages like Lua.
All these reflection systems use a C builder design pattern.
