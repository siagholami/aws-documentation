Customizing Post-Processing Effects
Lumberyard includes post-processing effects that can help improve your game's graphics, lighting, and transitions between effects such as color correction, bloom, and depth of field.
Use XML files with Script Canvas editor or Lua scripts to customize effects by setting their parameters, create prioritized groups of effect parameter sand enable or disable them.
You can also use effect groups to specify the following:
 Blend curves to smoothly transition between effects
 Stay enabled until explicitly disabled
 Make effect strength based on distance from the camera
Note
Creating a new effect requires modifying Lumberyard, while creating a new effect group does not.
