Flagging Dynamic Slices
A slice flagged as a dynamic slice can be used like any other slice, but it can also be instantiated at runtime.
You can flag a slice as dynamic in the Asset Browser. 
To flag a slice as dynamic
 Right-click the .slice file and choose Set Dynamic Slice.
To instantiate a UI slice at runtime, use the UiSpawner component on a UI element. This causes the system to automatically spawn a dynamic slice on activation. It also exposes a bus to Lua and C that allows the slice to be instantiated whenever needed.
