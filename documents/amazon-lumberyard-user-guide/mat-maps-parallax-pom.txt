Applying Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM)
To apply POM, complete the following procedure.
To apply Parallax Occlusion Mapping


In Lumberyard Editor, click Tools, Material Editor.


In the left tree, select the desired asset.


In the right pane, under Shader Generation Params, select Offset bump mapping and Parallax occlusion mapping. 


Under Shader Params, adjust the values of the following parameters.


Height bias – Moves the plane where the displacement is applied. This reduces gaps in meshes, and prevents objects from displacing other objects that are placed above them.


POM Displacement – Sets the POM depth. A larger value adds more depth.


Self shadow strength – Changes the strength of self-shadowing. A larger value imparts more shadowing


Under Texture Maps, enter the paths to the various textures.
