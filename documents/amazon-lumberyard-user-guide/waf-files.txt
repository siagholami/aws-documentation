Waf File System
You can find global configurations and project specs in the _WAF_ directory at the root project path. Three subfolders represent settings specific to the following build systems: android, apple, and msbuild. Defined specs are located in the specs directory.
In addition to the configurations specified in the _WAF_ directory, you can find other Waf settings in the waf_branch_spec.py file in the root directory. You can modify this file if you need to include support for additional platforms or configurations. 
The Waf build file system can be grouped into three categories:
 Waf Module files (wscript)
 Waf file list (*.waf_files)
 Project and compilation files such as *.h, *.cpp, and so on
