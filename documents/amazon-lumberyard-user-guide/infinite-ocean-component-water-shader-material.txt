Water Shader Material for the Infinite Ocean Component
The Infinite Ocean component is compatible only with a material that uses the water shader, such as the default ocean_default.mtl file. The water shader is a dedicated shader that Lumberyard uses only to render the ocean, and adds effects such as reflection, ripple, and foam. 
Example Water Shader
The following is an example of how you can configure the water shader material in the Material Editor.  

Note
When you set up water materials for the ocean, disable the Water Volume parameter.
When you set up water material for other types of water volumes, such as lakes and rivers, enable the Water Volume parameter.
For more information, see Water Shader.
For lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water, use the WaterVolume Shader.
