Using Image Naming Conventions
You can use any existing or created image processing presets. To do this, append the suffix to the end of the file name before you add it to your Lumberyard directory.
Example
If you create an image that you want to use as a decal, add the _decal suffix to the file name before the extension. For example, to convert scorchmark.tif as a decal, rename it to scorchmark_decal.tif. You then add it to your Lumberyard directory, so that Asset Processor automatically processes the file.
There are a number of existing presets that you can use. For a full list, see the rc.ini file in the lumberyard_version\dev\Bin64vc141\rc directory.
Some of the existing presets include the following:
 _diff – Albedo
 _spec, _refl – Specular textures
 _ddn – Normal map texture
 _ddna – Normal map texture with smoothness in alpha
 _bump – Converts grayscale texture to normal map
 _displ – Displacement map
 _decal – Decal
 _detail – Merged detail maps
 _cm, _cubemap – HDR reflection textures
 _cch – Color chart
 _mask – Grayscale mask
 _sss, _trans, _opac – Opacity
