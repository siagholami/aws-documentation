Size Attribute
In the Size attribute, specify how to control the particle's size and shape.

For the Size, Pivot, and Stretch parameters, you can set a Random value and Strength Over Emitter Lifetime and Strength Over Particle Lifetime curves.
Size Attribute Parameters 



Name
Description




Lock Aspect Ratio
Maintains the particle aspect ratio.Default value: false


Size X, Y, Z
Specifies the world particle size.  For 2D sprite particles, only X and Y are used.  For geometry particles, X, Y, and Z are used. For more information, see the Geometry parameter. Valid values: 0 Default value: 1


Pivot X, Y, Z
Moves the sprite's pivot point. For 2D sprite particles, only X and Y are used.  For geometry particles, X, Y, and Z are used. For more information, see the Geometry parameter. Valid values: -1 to 1 Default value: 0 (texture center)


Stretch
Specifies the amount of stretch, in seconds, that is applied to the particle in the direction of travel. This is based on the current velocity and stretches in both directions by default. Offset Ratio – Adjusts the center of stretching. 0 = stretch both directions | 1 = stretch backward only | –1 = stretch forward only.Valid values: 0Default value: 0


Tail Length
(CPU only) The length of the particle's tail in seconds. The particle texture is stretched through the tail. Tail Steps – The number of segments for the tail. A higher number produces smoother tail curves for nonlinear, moving particles.Valid values: 0Default value: 0


Min Pixels
(CPU only) Adds the specified number of pixels to the particle's true size when rendering. This is useful for important effects that should be visible even at a distance. Valid values: 0Default value: 0
