System requirements
Lumberyard has a minimum set of system requirements for development, as outlined in the following sections. Disk space and RAM requirements are dependent on the options that you choose during installation. If you have already installed Lumberyard, you can use Lumberyard Setup Assistant to see the requirements for the tools and features that you want for your Lumberyard development environment. Lumberyard Setup Assistant provides information about installing third-party software and SDKs on your computer. For more information, see Using Lumberyard Setup Assistant to Set Up Your Development Environment. 
If your system is capable of running a modern real-time 3D game with good performance you should be set, however, review these detailed requirements to be certain. 
Lumberyard requires Windows 10.

Developer tools
You can use the Lumberyard Editor and tools without installing additional software. To create new projects or use advanced development features in Lumberyard, you need a developer environment. One of the following versions of Microsoft Visual Studio is required: 
  Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 version 16.2.4 or later. 
  Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 version 15.9.14 or later. 
Note
The definitive source for the minimum version of Visual Studio for any particular release of Lumberyard is set in the file dev\_WAF_\settings\platforms\platform.win_x64_vs2019.json. Look for the vswhere-args settings. The minimum version is the first value in the default_value range. 
Microsoft offers Visual Studio Community edition free to individual developers. For more information and to download and install Visual Studio Community, visit the  Visual Studio Community portal. 
Visual Studio 2017 and 2019 required features
The default Visual Studio installation might not include all of the features that are required by Lumberyard. Ensure that the following Visual Studio features are enabled:


Launch the Visual Studio Installer from your download directory or the Start Menu if you've already installed Visual Studio. 


If you've installed Visual Studio, choose More - Modify on the version of Visual Studio you'll use with Lumberyard. 


On the Workloads tab:
    Select Game development with C.

In the Installation details panel on the right, select at least one Windows 10 SDK.



On the Individual components tab, under Compilers, build tools, and runtime, select the VC toolset that corresponds to the installed version of Visual Studio: 
    Visual Studio 2017: Select at least one version of the VC 2017 toolset. 
    Visual Studio 2019: Select at least one version of the MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C x64/x86 build tool. 

(Optional) To build with the Visual Studio 2017 toolset, select MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C x64/x86 build tools. 



Note
Incredibuild users: Installing, reinstalling, or upgrading Visual Studio may cause the Incredibuild Agent to lose its settings or require an update. After modifying Visual Studio, be sure to confirm your Incredibuild Agent is active. For instructions on configuring the agent properly, see Compiling with IncrediBuild. 
Note
Beginning with Visual Studio 2017, Microsoft now releases updates on a more frequent cadence (in some cases weekly). Lumberyard is tested with the latest version of Visual Studio available during the release cycle. 
Visual C redistributable packages
Lumberyard Installer will attempt to download and install the required Visual C Redistributable packages during the installation process. Under some circumstances, the installation of these redistributable packages may fail. If you receive a missing Visual C runtime .dll error while running Lumberyard Installer, Lumberyard Setup Assistant, or Project Configurator, do the following: 


Check that the Visual C redistributable installers for Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio 2019 have been successfully downloaded. The installers are located in the corresponding Visual Studio directories in the lumberyard_version\dev\Tools\Redistributables\ directory. 


If the Visual C redistributable installers for Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio 2019 have not been downloaded by Lumberyard Installer, manually download the installers from Microsoft. 
     Visual C Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 
     Visual C Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 


Run both Visual C redistributable installers. 


Retry the Lumberyard installation after the Visual Studio redistributables have successfully installed. 


Note
The Visual C Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 also contains redistributables for Visual Studio 2015 and 2017.
