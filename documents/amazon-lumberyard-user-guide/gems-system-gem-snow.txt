Snow Gem

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
The Snow Gem creates realistic snow effects in your levels, including snowflake and surface effects, such as snow buildup. To enable the Snow Gem in your project, see Add modular features and assets with Gems.
Note
Place only a single Snow entity in your scene.

Placing Snow
You can place your snow and customize it to your level by modifying properties for brightness, gravity, size and quantity of snow flakes, how much snow and frost builds on a surface, and more.
To add snow to your level


In the Rollup Bar, click Entity.


Under Browser, expand Environment.


Drag the Snow entity into your scene.


Configuring Snow
You can configure the snow's properties under https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/entities-params-entity-params.html and Entity Properties.

Using Console Variables for Snow
You can use the following console variables console variables for the snow entity.
Snow Entity Console Variables 



Variable
Description




r_Snow
Enables snow rendering


r_SnowDisplacement
Enables displacement for snow accumulation


r_SnowFlakeClusters
Number of snow flake clusters


r_SnowHalfRes
When enabled, renders snow at half resolution to conserve fill rate



Using the Snow Sample
The Snow Sample uses the Snow and Clouds gems to demonstrate how to use the Snow entity as an environment special effects in a level. The Snow entity shows how snow falls and provides properties that you can set to randomly change the snow fall over time, creating a more dynamic weather experience.
