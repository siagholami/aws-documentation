Creating Wind Areas

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
Wind areas define a location within which objects experience wind. If no direction is set, wind moves omnidirectionally from the center of the wind area.
To create a wind area


In the Rollup Bar, under Objects, click Entity.


Under Browser, expand Physics and double-click WindArea.


Drag to place the entity in your level. A bounding box with direction areas appears.


Under Entity Properties, adjust values of the following parameters:
    Active – Enables or disables wind inside the area.
    AirDensity – If greater than 0, causes objects moving through the air to slow down.
    AirResistance – If greater than 0, causes lightweight objects to experience buoyancy.
    Ellipsoidal – Specifies an ellipsoidal drop off in air speed.
    FalloffInner – Sets the distance at which distance-based air speed begins to drop off.
    Speed – Sets the wind speed.
    Dir – Sets the wind direction. 
    Size – Sets the size of the wind area.
