TPS Query Execution Flow
The following steps summarize the definition and execution stages of a TPS query. Note that only stages 3 and 4 have a significant impact on performance.


Parse query:
    Parse query strings and values.
    This step is usually performed once and cached.


Make query request:
    Query is made using C, ScriptBind, goalops, etc.
    A query is stateless; it does not imply a movement operation.


Generate points:
    Create a set of candidate points.
    Point candidates are based on the query's Generation criteria.


Evaluate points (this is by far the most intensive stage):
    Accept or reject points based on Conditions criteria.
    Assign relative scores to points based on Weights criteria.


Consider query fallbacks:
    If no point matches the Conditions criteria, consider fallback options.
    Where there is a fallback, return to step 3.


Visualize points:
    If visualization is required, draw all points to screen.
    Include point data such as its accepted/rejected status and relative scores.


Return results:
    Return one or more points, if any fit the query conditions.
    Each point is returned as a structure that describes the selected point.


There are some optimizations possible that depend on the execution flow. For example, relevant query results can be cached between fallback queries.
