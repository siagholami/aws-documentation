# Using Amazon GameLift<a name="network-gamelift-using"></a>

Lumberyard supports hosting dedicated servers on the cloud by using Amazon GameLift\. Amazon GameLift is a managed AWS service for deploying, operating, and scaling session\-based multiplayer games\. Amazon GameLift is built on AWS’s highly available cloud infrastructure and allows you to quickly scale high\-performance game servers up and down to meet player demand – without any additional engineering effort or upfront costs\. It reduces the time required to build a multiplayer backend from thousands of hours to just minutes\.

To use GameLift in your project, there are two options:
+ Enable the [GameLift Gem](gems-system-gem-gamelift.md) in your project\. Lumberyard has integrated Amazon GameLift, which makes it easier for you to use GameLift\.
+ Enable the Lumberyard [Multiplayer Gem](gems-system-gem-multiplayer.md) in your project \(which requires the GameLift Gem\)\.

For information about configuring GameLift for the multiplayer sample, see [Configuring the Multiplayer Sample for Amazon GameLift](network-multiplayer-gs-gamelift.md)\. For information, see [Add modular features and assets with Gems](gems-system-gems.md)\. For more information about GameLift, see [Amazon GameLift](https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/)\.
