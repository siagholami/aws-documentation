# Editing Animation Data<a name="ui-animation-editing"></a>

After you create your sequence\(s\) and record animation data to them, you can use the **Node Pane**, **Track Editor**, and **Curve Editor** in the **Animation Editor** to modify your sequences\.
+ In the **Node Pane**, you can add or remove UI elements from an animation sequence, edit sequences, and work with keys\. For more information, see [Using the Node Pane](ui-animation-using-node-pane.md)\.
+ In the **Track Editor**, you can limit your animation preview, manipulate keys, and change your animation's timeline\. For more information, see [Using the Track Editor](ui-animation-track-editor.md)\.
+ In the **Curve Editor**, you can manipulate splines to change the behavior of the transitions between keys\. For more information, see [Using the **Curve Editor** in the UI Animation Editor\.](ui-animation-curve-editor.md)\.

You can use the toolbar to select a sequence to display and edit\.

**To select an animation sequence to edit**
+ In **Animation Editor**, click the arrow next to the name of the current sequence in the toolbar to display a list of active sequences available to edit\.
