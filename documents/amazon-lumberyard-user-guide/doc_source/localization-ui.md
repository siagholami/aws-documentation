# UI System Localization Features<a name="localization-ui"></a>

By default, all **[Text](ui-editor-components-text.md)** component values are passed to the [Localization Manager](localization-initialization.md#localization-initialization-manager) for localizing\. If the value of a **[Text](ui-editor-components-text.md)** component matches a localization key for the currently loaded language, then the localized text is rendered\.

For an example, open the **[Samples Project](sample-project-samples.md)**\. In the [**UI Editor**](ui-editor-using.md), load the following UI canvas: `dev/Gems/LyShineExamples/Assets/UI/Canvases/LyShineExamples/Localization/Text.uicanvas`\.

You can quickly test a UI canvas that contains localized text\. To change the current language in the [**UI Editor**](ui-editor-using.md), choose **View**, **Set Current Language**\.
