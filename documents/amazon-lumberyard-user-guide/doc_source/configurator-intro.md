# Creating Lumberyard projects<a name="configurator-intro"></a>

****  
This feature is in [preview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#preview) release and is subject to change\. 

The Project Configurator is a standalone application that allows you to specify to the Waf build system which game projects and assets \([Gems](gems-system-gems.md)\) to include in a game build\. With it, you can create new projects, save active projects, configure advanced settings, and enable, disable, or create new [Gems](gems-system-gems.md)\. You can also use [Lmbr\.exe](lmbr-exe.md) to perform these functions in a command line environment\.

For information about Waf build system, see [Using the Waf Build System](waf-intro.md)\. For information about Gems, see [Add modular features and assets with Gems](gems-system-gems.md)\.

**Note**  
Before you can run the Project Configurator, you must first run [Lumberyard Setup Assistant](lumberyard-launcher-using.md) and close Lumberyard Editor\.
