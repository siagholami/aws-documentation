This topic references tools and features that are [legacy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#legacy)\. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the [CryEntity Removal gem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/gems-system-cryentity-removal-gem.html) using the [Project Configurator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/configurator-intro.html) or the [command line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/lmbr-exe.html)\. To learn more about legacy features, see the [Lumberyard Legacy Reference](https://d3bqhfbip4ze4a.cloudfront.net/lumberyard-legacy.pdf)\.

To create realistic water puddles and water rifts, use non\-tiling textures that can be placed as decals\. While water puddles could be created as a water volume, using decals is less demanding on resources\. For more information on decals, see [Working with Decals](mat-maps-decal-intro.md)\.

For proper blending between the water puddle and the terrain, use an alpha channel with a smooth gradient so it fades into the terrain and the transition won't be noticeable\.
