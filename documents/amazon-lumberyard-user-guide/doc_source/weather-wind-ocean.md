If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the [CryEntity Removal gem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/gems-system-cryentity-removal-gem.html) using the [Project Configurator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/configurator-intro.html) or the [command line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/lmbr-exe.html)\.

You can simulate realistic wind and wave effects for the ocean in your level\.

**To set ocean wind parameters**

1. In Lumberyard Editor, choose **Tools**, **Rollup Bar**\.

1. In the **Rollup Bar**, on the **Terrain** tab, under **Terrain**, click **Environment**\.

1. Under **OceanAnimation**, adjust the following parameters:
   + **Wind Direction** – Specifies the direction to push the water texture crawl in radians\. Valid values: 0\.0 to 6\.28\.
   + **Wind Speed** – Specifies how frequently the texture water crawl updates\.
   + **Wave Frequency** – Sets the frequency of waves\. Smaller values mean fewer, longer waves \(deep ocean depth\)\. Larger values mean more, shorter waves \(shallow ocean depth\)\.
   + **Wave Height** – Sets wave height in meters by means of vertex displacement\.
