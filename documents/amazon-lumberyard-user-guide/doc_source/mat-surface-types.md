# Selecting Material Surface Type<a name="mat-surface-types"></a>

The surface of a material determines the physical effects and how the material reacts to other materials and its environment\. For example, a metal surface is hard, doesnâ€™t shatter, reacts to bullets by generating spark particles, and has a unique sound when struck\. Contrast this with a grass surface, which is soft, responds to wind, generates grass strands and dirt particles when hit, and sounds different than metal\.
