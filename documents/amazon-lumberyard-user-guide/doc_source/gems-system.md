# Programming with Gems<a name="gems-system"></a>

The modular gems system is a management infrastructure for sharing code and art assets between Lumberyard game projects\. The modular gems system consists of gem packages that you can access and manage with the [Project Configurator](configurator-intro.md) or [`Lmbr.exe`](lmbr-exe.md)\. You can use gems to add functionality such as code, art, scripts, supporting files, and references to other gems to your game project\.
