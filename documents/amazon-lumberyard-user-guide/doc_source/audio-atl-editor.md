# Using the Audio Controls Editor<a name="audio-atl-editor"></a>

Your game communicates all actions, events, and parameters to the audio system with Audio Translation Layer \(ATL\) controls\. These ATL controls are mapped to one or more controls inside your selected middleware \(Wwise or Wwise LTX\)\. With the **Audio Controls Editor**, you can create controls and make connections between the ATL controls and the middleware controls\.

**To open the Audio Controls Editor**
+ In Lumberyard Editor, choose **Tools**, **Other**, **Audio Controls Editor**\.

The **Audio Controls Editor** has three areas:

1. [ATL Controls Pane](audio-atl-editor-atl-controls.md) – Hierarchical view of controls that exist in your project\. The displayed icon designates the type of control\.

1. [Inspector Pane](audio-atl-editor-inspector.md) – Properties for the control selected in the **ATL Controls** pane\.

1. [Wwise Controls Pane](audio-atl-editor-middleware.md) – Controls created in the audio middleware authoring application, such as Wwise or Wwise LTX Authoring Tool\.
