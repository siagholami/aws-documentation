# Customizing the Particle Editor UI<a name="particle-editor-customizing"></a>

The **Particle Editor** has a customizable interface so you can set up your workspace in different layouts\. All panels are moveable\. You can undock panels to become floating windows, or you can dock panels in new locations to rearrange the look and feel\. Save your custom layouts to access later or to share with others\.

You can customize the **Particle Editor** in the following ways:

**Floating panels**  
Drag the panel title bar to separate the panel from the editor and make it a floating window\.

Dock panels on the edges of the window or anywhere an orange highlight appears\. To dock a floating panel, drag the panel title bar into the **Particle Editor** window\.

**Tabbing panels**  
You can dock a panel inside another panel to create a tabbed view\. Toggle the tabs to display one panel and hide the other\. This option minimizes the number of panels that are visible at a time\.

**Showing or hiding panels**  
Customize which panels are visible by clicking **View** and choosing a panel to show or hide\.
