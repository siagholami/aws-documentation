# UI Animation Editor<a name="ui-animation"></a>

You can use animation sequences to animate UI elements in your game's UI\. A UI canvas can contain many named animation sequences\.

The UI **Animation Editor** has the following features:
+ **Menu** – Operations for creating new animation sequences and switching between the **Track Editor** and **Curve Editor**\.
+ **Toolbar** – Tools for the editing and playback of animations\. The **Curve Editor** displays an additional toolbar at the top of the pane\.
+ **Node pane** – Area for showing the active sequence and all of the elements that it is animating\. A track for each animated property appears underneath the related element\.
+ **Editor pane** – Area for either the **Track Editor**, the **Curve Editor**, or both\.

**To show the **Animation Editor** if it is not already visible**
+ From the [**UI Editor**](ui-editor-using.md) menu, choose **View**, **Animation Editor**\.

To create an animation sequence, you first create a new sequence, assign one or more UI elements to it, and then record changes you make to the UI element\(s\)—this becomes the animation sequence\. You can then edit the animation sequence\(s\) using the **Animation Editor**\. These processes are described in greater detail in the following sections\.
