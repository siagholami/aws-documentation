# Environment Probes and Cubemaps<a name="mat-shaders-environment-probes-intro"></a>

Cube mapping uses the six faces of a cube as the texture for a material\. The cube map is generated by projecting and then rendering the scene six times from a single viewpoint, one for each cube face\. In this way, the local environment can be stored as either six square textures, or unfolded onto six regions of a single texture\. This texture is used to store the image of the environment surrounding the object\. Cube maps are useful for showing reflections, and are relatively small in size because reflections can be blurry as long as you are not simulating a mirror\. 

Cube maps control shadow color, ambient diffuse, and particle diffuse as well as reflections\. They function as bounce lighting by taking the colors from the surroundings and applying them directly into the diffuse texture of materials inside their specified radius\.

Cube maps use image\-based lighting\. For more information see [Image\-Based Lighting](mat-shaders-image-lighting.md)\.
