The Rise/Lower brush is perhaps the most versatile of all the terrain brushes and is often the first used\. With it you can create many macroterrain landforms and features such as mountains, hills, cliffs, valleys, and riverbeds, for example\. After using this brush, see [Using the Flatten Brush](terrain-landforms-flatten-brush.md) and [Using the Smooth Brush](terrain-landforms-smooth-brush.md) to learn how to control the shape and overall visual look\.

**To use the Rise/Lower brush**

1. In the **Rollup Bar**, on the **Terrain** tab, click **Modify**, **Rise/Lower**\.

1. Adjust the **Height** slider to the desired height:
   + Use positive values for landforms that rise above the base level\.
   + Use negative values for valleys and other landforms that sink below the base level\.

1. Adjust the **Outside Radius** and **Inner Radius** sliders \(and the difference between the values\) to control the steepness of the terrain\.

1. In the level, drag the mouse around to achieve the desired effect\. 

1. Under **Modify Terrain**, adjust **Brush Settings** and **Noise Settings** parameters as needed\. See [Terrain Brush Parameters](terrain-landforms-brush-params.md) for more information\.

1. When done, click **Terrain**, **Modify** or press **Esc**\.
