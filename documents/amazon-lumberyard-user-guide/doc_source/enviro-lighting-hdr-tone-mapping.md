# HDR Settings<a name="enviro-lighting-hdr-tone-mapping"></a>

As discussed in [Illuminance and Auto Exposure Key](enviro-lighting-luminance-scene-key.md), the auto exposure key setting controls the amount of scene exposure and determines whether the tone\-mapped image appears relatively bright or dark\. Several other settings also affect the tone mapping of scene\. These are known collectively as HDR \(high dynamic range\) in the **Time of Day Editor**\.

Film curve parameters in the **Time of Day Editor** correspond to analogous parameters that exist for camera film\. A film curve has three distinct regions with different contrast transfer characteristics:
+ The lower part of a film curve that is associated with relatively low exposures is designated the toe, and corresponds to the low\-density portions of an image\. When an image is exposed so that areas fall within the toe region, little or no contrast is transferred to the image\.
+ The upper part of a film curve that is associated with relatively high exposures is designated the shoulder, and corresponds to the high\-density portions of an image\. When an image is exposed so that areas fall within the shoulder region, little or no contrast is transferred to the image\.
+ The middle part of a film curve with the highest level of contrast is produced within a range of exposures falling between the toe and the shoulder, and is designated the midtones region\. This portion of the curve is characterized by a relatively straight and steep slope in comparison to the toe and shoulder regions\. You should adjust your image so that important areas fall within this region for maximum contrast\.

**To set HDR settings parameters**

1. In Lumberyard Editor, choose **Tools**, **Other**, **Time Of Day**\.

1. Choose **HDR Settings**, and for **HDR**, adjust the values of the following settings\.
