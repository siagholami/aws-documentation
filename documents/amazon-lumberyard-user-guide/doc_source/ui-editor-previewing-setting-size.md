# Setting Canvas Size in Preview<a name="ui-editor-previewing-setting-size"></a>

Change your game UI canvas size in **UI Editor** **Preview** to visualize how your canvas might look at different screen resolutions and to see how the interactive elements change state\. Changing your canvas size in **Preview** does not affect the canvas size at which you are authoring the UI canvasâ€”that is controlled in the [**UI Editor**](ui-editor-changing-size.md)\.

Setting your canvas size in **Preview** is useful when designing games that run on devices that have multiple resolutions\. You can see at different resolutions how an element's size and position changes based on the settings of its **Transform2D** properties, such as anchors, offsets, and the **Scale to Device** settings\. For more information on the **Transform2D** properties, see [Transform2D Component](ui-editor-components-transform.md)\.

The **Canvas scale** in the toolbar shows the scale at which the canvas is displayed\. If the **Preview canvas size** selected is larger than the viewport size, the canvas you are previewing is drawn at a reduced scale\.
