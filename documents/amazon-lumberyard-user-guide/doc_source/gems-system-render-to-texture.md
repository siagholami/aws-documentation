This feature is in [preview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#preview) release and is subject to change\. 

Enable the Render to Texture gem for your game so that you can use the **[Render to Texture](component-render-to-texture.md)** component\. You can use this component to render the scene to a texture from the viewport of the selected camera\. For example, you can add game objects such as mirrors, security camera screens, and draw 3D models\.
