# Configuring UI Anchors and Offsets<a name="ui-editor-transform2d"></a>

Each UI element's position is determined by the **Transform2D** component\. The **Transform2D** component sets a UI element's position and size relative to its parent's edges\. The parent may be another element \(if the elements are nested\), or the canvas\.

For more information about the **Transform2D** component, see [Managing UI Anchors and Offsets](ui-editor-anchors.md)\.
