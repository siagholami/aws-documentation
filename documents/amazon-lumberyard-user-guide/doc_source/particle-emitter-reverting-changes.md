# Reverting Changes to Emitter Attributes<a name="particle-emitter-reverting-changes"></a>

Emitters have a list of attributes or property types that are categorized for easier identification\. You can reorder and rearrange the categories, including combining categories into a tabbed view\. 
+ To reorder categories, drag and drop the category to the preferred position\. An orange highlight appears to indicate a valid docking location\. 
+ To combine categories into tabs, drag a category on another category title bar\. If you have not expanded the category, the tabs appear collapsed until you click a category title bar\. 
+ To revert changes made to the **Attributes** panel layout, click the menu in the title bar and choose **Reset to default**\. 

By default, emitter parameters are set to the attribute as a common starting point\. These default attributes have a white text label\. When you change the attribute parameter from the default state, the text label changes from white to orange\.
+ To revert the last change to the emitter attribute, click **Edit**, **Undo**\. Alternatively, you can press **Ctrl\+Z**\.
+ To revert all changes to the attributes parameter, right\-click the attribute name and choose **Reset to default**\.
