# Shapes: Cylinder, Capsule, Disk, Box, Sphere, Compound<a name="component-shapes"></a>

Add shape components to entities that have other components that require shapes\.

For example, add shape components to your entities to create volumes for the following:
+ Create a trigger volume using the**[Trigger Area](component-triggerarea.md)** component\. Entities that enter the volume trigger an action\.
+ Create a collision volume using the **[PhysX Collider](component-physx-collider.md)** component\. Entities that collide with the collision volume respond to the impact, such as slowing down or bouncing back\.
+ Define reverb or echo effects using the **[Audio Environment](component-audio-environment.md)** component\. 
+ Create an audio area using the **[Audio Trigger](component-audio-trigger.md)** component so that a specific sound plays in that area of the level\.

**Note**  
You can add only one shape component to an entity\. If you need more than one shape on an entity, create child entities\.

Each shape component provides a generic `ShapeService` that exposes functionality common to all shapes\. Each shape also provides a more specific service, such as `BoxShapeService` or `SphereShapeService`\.

The **Shape** component includes the following shapes and properties:

## Scaling Shapes<a name="component-shape-scaling"></a>

As a best practice, when you scale a shape, adjust the shape component's properties, such as its **Dimensions**, **Height**, and **Radius**\.

![\[Scale a Box Shape by adjusting its Dimensions values. Scale a Cylinder Shape by adjusting its Height and Radius values.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/component/component-shape-scaling-2.png)

**Tip**  
Modify the shape component's properties instead using the [Scale tool](lumberyard-editor-toolbars.md#lumberyard-editor-toolbars-editmode), which changes the entity's **[Transform](component-transform.md)** component\. 

**Example**  
See the following examples for the different scaling:  

1. In nonuniform scaling, adjusting an entity's transform scale leads to different values for **X**, **Y**, and **Z**\. 

1. In uniform scaling, **X**, **Y**, and **Z** have the same value\. 

1. In uniform normalized scaling, all of the scale values are `1`\. 

![\[Nonuniform scaling (1), where X, Y, and Z have different values. Uniform scaling (2), where X, Y, and Z values are the same (in this case, 4). Uniform normalized scaling (3), where X, Y, and Z values are all 1.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/component/component-shape-scaling-1.png)
If an entity has been scaled nonuniformly, rendering and intersection tests use the largest component of the scale vector\. Although this can work, the best practice is to keep a uniform and, ideally, normalized \(`1`, `1`, `1`\) transform scale, as shown in the third example\.

## Box Shape Component Properties<a name="box-shape-component-properties"></a>

![\[The box shape component properties in Lumberyard Editor.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/component/box-shape-component-properties.png)

The **Box Shape** component has the following properties\.


****  

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Visible |  The component always appears in the viewport, even if the entity isn't selected\.   | 
| Game View |  Renders the box shape in game mode in Lumberyard Editor\. To enter game mode, press **Ctrl\+G**\.  | 
|  **Shape Color**  |  Specifies the color to render the shape\.  |

The **Box Shape** component also has its own Component Mode with several linear manipulators for each axis\.

| Radius |  The radius of the capsule\. If the **[Transform](component-transform.md)** component applies a scale, these dimensions are multiplied by the same value\.  | 

## Compound Shape Component Properties<a name="compound-shape-component-properties"></a>

![\[The Compound Shape component properties in Lumberyard Editor.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/component/compound-shape-component-properties.png)

With the **Compound Shape** component, you can combine shapes to create a complex object to generate a physics collider, trigger shape, or any other application of shapes\. The individual shapes might or might not be children of the entity with the **Compound Shape** component\. 

**Note**  
To move the shapes together with the compound shape, set them as child entities\.
To move the shapes independent of the entity with the compound shape, don't set them as child entities\. 
For EBus \(event bus\) requests, compound shapes service the full shape component bus\. However, each individual shape that you add increases the cost of requests such as `IsPointInside`\. 

See the following **Compound Shape** properties\.


****  

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Child Shape Entities |  Specifies the entities and their shapes that make up the compound shape\. These entities might or might not be children of the entity with the compound shape\.  |

## Request EBus Interface<a name="shape-component-ebuses"></a>

All shape components provide access to two separate request buses\. The first bus is the `[ShapeComponentRequestsBus](#component-shape-ebus-request)` that returns general information about the shape component\. The second bus is the [`ShapeNameComponentRequestsBus`](#component-shape-components-request-bus) that returns property configurations for the specified shape\.

Use the following request functions with the event bus interface to communicate with other components in your game\.

For more information, see [Working with the Event Bus \(EBus\) system](ebus-intro.md)\.
