# Using Encryption<a name="network-encryption-intro"></a>

GridMate uses the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) implementation of [Datagram Transport Layer Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347) \(DTLS\) to support encryption of all UDP traffic sent between clients and servers\. 

## Limitations<a name="network-encryption-intro-limitations"></a>

GridMate's implementation of encryption has the following limitations: 
+  Only 64\-bit Windows is supported\. 
+  Only client\-server topologies are supported\. 

## Implementation Support<a name="network-encryption-intro-implementation-support"></a>

GridMate supports encryption for the following implementations: 
+  Server and client authentication 
+  Self\-signed certificates 
+  A single strong OpenSSL cipher 

## Cipher<a name="network-encryption-intro-cipher"></a>

GridMate uses the following single OpenSSL cipher for all encrypted connections: `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`\. 

 This cipher uses the technologies listed in the following table:
