Although you can paint in your terrain to add grass quickly, the manual approach saves memory and results in better control and a more realistic effect\.

**To manually add grass**

1. In Lumberyard Editor, click **Tools**, **Material Editor**\.

1. Expand the left tree and select a suitable asset\.

1. Under **Material Settings**, select the **Vegetation** shader\.

1. Under **Shader Generation Params** select **Grass**\.

1. Modify other settings and parameter values for the desired effect\. 

1. Click **Assign Object to Item**\. Close Material Editor\.

1. If necessary, depending on your terrain, in the **Rollup Bar**, on the **Terrain** tab, select the **AlignToTerrain** check box\.

1. Click to place grass in your level and repeat as needed\.

**Note**  
When you add or move grass, it may sporadically jump around\. This happens if you move vegetation to a location that is too dense to accommodate it\. When this occurs, the vegetation moves to its last position and is outlined in red\. You can then move it elsewhere or delete it\.
