# Animating the UI<a name="ui-animating"></a>

You can animate your game's UI using one of the following tools:

[**Scripted Entity Tweener System**](ui-animating-tweener.md)  
Installed as a gem, this system uses custom Lua scripts to create powerful and flexible animations\.

[**UI Animation Editor**](ui-animation.md)  
Embedded as a GUI in the **UI Editor**, this tool can create complex animations\. You activate your animation sequences by using Script Canvas, with the UiAnimationBus eBus, or through C\+\+ scripting\.
