These nodes provide MBT functionality related to flying vehicles\.

## Hover<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-hover"></a>

Causes a flying AI agent to hover at its current position\.

### Parameters<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-hover-parameters"></a>

None\.

### Success/Failure<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-hover-success"></a>

The node does not SUCCEED or FAIL\. Once executed, it continues running until forced to terminate\.

### Example<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-hover-example"></a>

```
<Hover />
```

## FlyShoot<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-flyshoot"></a>

Allows the AI agent to shoot at its attention target when possible from its current position\.

If the AI agent's secondary weapon system is used, the node will only open fire if the weapons are able to hit close enough to the target\. Otherwise normal firing rules are applied\.

### Parameters<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-flyshoot-parameters"></a>

**useSecondaryWeapon**  
Boolean indicating whether or not the secondary weapon system \(such as rocket launchers\) should be used\. Default is 0\.

### Success/Failure<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-flyshoot-success"></a>

The node does not SUCCEED or FAIL\. Once executed, the AI agent continues to shoot until forced to terminate\.

### Example<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-flyshoot-example"></a>

```
<FlyShoot useSecondaryWeapon="1" />
```

## WaitAlignedWithAttentionTarget<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-waitalignedwithattentiontarget"></a>

Waits until the AI agent is facing its attention target\.

### Parameters<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-waitalignedwithattentiontarget-parameters"></a>

**toleranceDegrees**  
Maximum angle \(in degrees\) between the attention target and the forward direction of the AI agent to consider the AI agent to be "facing" the attention target\. Allowed values include the range \[0\.0,180\.0\]\. Default is 20\.0\. 

### Success/Failure<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-waitalignedwithattentiontarget-success"></a>

The node SUCCEEDS if the angle between the AI agent's forward direction and its attention target is within the allowed range\. The node FAILS if the AI agent has no attention target\.

### Example<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-waitalignedwithattentiontarget-example"></a>

**maxStartDistanceAlongNonLoopingPath**  
Maximum distance \(in meters\) to look ahead for the closest point to link with another path\. This parameter is used to link with non\-looping paths; for example, it is useful to prevent the AI agent from snapping to the new path at a position that seems closer but is actually behind a wall after a U\-turn\. Defaults is 30\.0\. 

**loopAlongPath**  
Boolean indicating whether or not the AI agent should follow a path in an endless loop\. Default is 0\. 

**startPathFromClosestLocation**  
Boolean indicating at what point the AI agent should start following a path\. Default is 0\.  
+ 1 \- at its closest position
+ 2 \- at the first path waypoint

**pathEndDistance**  
Distance \(in meters\) from the end of the path that this node should start sending arrival notification events\. Defaults is 1\.0\. 

**goToRefPoint**  
Boolean indicating whether or not the current reference point should be appended to the end of the path\. Default is 0\.

### Success/Failure<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-fly-success"></a>

The node SUCCEEDS if the AI agent reached the end of the path\. The node FAILS if no valid path was assigned to the AI agent\.

```

### Lua table settings<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-fly-luatable"></a>

+ ArrivedCloseToPathEnd
+ ArrivedAtPathEnd

## FlyForceAttentionTarget<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-flyforceattentiontarget"></a>

### Parameters<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-flyforceattentiontarget-parameters"></a>

None\. 

### Success/Failure<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-flyforceattentiontarget-success"></a>

None\. 

### Success/Failure<a name="ai-scripting-mbt-nodes-flying-flyaimatcombattarget-success"></a>

The node does not SUCCEED or FAIL\. Once executed, it continues to force the AI agent to rotate its body towards the attention target until termination\.
