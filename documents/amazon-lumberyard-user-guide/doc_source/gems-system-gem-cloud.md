# Sky Clouds Gem<a name="gems-system-gem-cloud"></a>

The Sky Clouds gem creates realistic and detailed cloud and weather effects in your game levels\. You can create clouds with either simple, sprite\-based shading, or more complex, voxelized 3D volume shading\. 

To enable the Sky Clouds gem for your project, see [Add modular features and assets with Gems](gems-system-gems.md)\. 

For more information about creating and placing clouds in your level, see [Sky Cloud](component-sky-cloud.md)\. 

For more information about working with clouds, including setting cloud shading parameters, adding 3D cloud shadows, and creating 3D cloud templates, see [Adding Clouds](weather-clouds-intro.md)\.
