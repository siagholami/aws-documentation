# OccluderArea<a name="component-occluder-area"></a>

****  
This feature is in [preview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#preview) release and is subject to change\. 

You can use the **OccluderArea** component to create a custom\-shaped occlusion plane with four vertices\. This is useful if you don't want Lumberyard to render everything that is behind the **OccluderArea** component\. This can result in better performance in areas where automatic occlusion doesn't work well\. For example, if you have many objects behind a wall, you can add an occluder area behind the wall so that those objects don't appear\.

**Note**  
You can't modify the **[OccluderArea](#component-occluder-area)**, **[Portal](component-portal.md)**, and **[VisArea](component-vis-area.md)** components at runtime\.

## Occluder Area Component Example<a name="component-occluder-area-example"></a>

The following example shows two boxes\. One box is hidden behind the occluder area, but you can see its shadow\. The other box is outside the occluder area and appears normally on screen\.
