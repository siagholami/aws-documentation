Wind areas define a location within which objects experience wind\. If no direction is set, wind moves omnidirectionally from the center of the wind area\.

**To create a wind area**

1. In the **Rollup Bar**, under **Objects**, click **Entity**\.

1. Under **Browser**, expand **Physics** and double\-click **WindArea**\.

1. Drag to place the entity in your level\. A bounding box with direction areas appears\.

1. Under **Entity Properties**, adjust values of the following parameters:
   + **Active** – Enables or disables wind inside the area\.
   + **AirDensity** – If greater than 0, causes objects moving through the air to slow down\.
   + **AirResistance** – If greater than 0, causes lightweight objects to experience buoyancy\.
   + **Ellipsoidal** – Specifies an ellipsoidal drop off in air speed\.
   + **FalloffInner** – Sets the distance at which distance\-based air speed begins to drop off\.
   + **Speed** – Sets the wind speed\.
   + **Dir** – Sets the wind direction\. 
   + **Size** – Sets the size of the wind area\.
