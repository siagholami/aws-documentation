**About Lumberyard Binaries**  
In this guide, you'll see references about the directory where the Lumberyard binaries are placed\. These binaries are placed either by the installer or as a result of you rebuilding them\. When you install Lumberyard, you'll see the following directories:

**For PC**
+ `dev/Bin64vc141` – Binaries generated with Visual Studio 2017
+ `dev/Bin64vc142` – Binaries generated with Visual Studio 2019

**For Mac**
+ `dev/BinMac64`

If you use binaries generated with Visual Studio, continue to use the mentioned executable from that directory, such as `Bin64vc141/AssetProcessor.exe`\.
