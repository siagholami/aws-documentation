# Setting up a Lobby<a name="network-lobby-setup"></a>

By default, the Lumberyard engine does not provide any specific lobby implementation, but instead provides the code interface required to construct one\. The [Multiplayer Gem](gems-system-gem-multiplayer.md) does, however, provide some useful constructs that aid in lobby creation using a basic lobby implementation using [components](component-components.md), that can be used as is, or as a reference\.

For more information, see the [Multiplayer Gem](gems-system-gem-multiplayer.md)\.
