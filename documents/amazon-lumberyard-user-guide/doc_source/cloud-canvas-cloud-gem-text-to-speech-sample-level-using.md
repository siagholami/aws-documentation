# Using the Text\-to\-Speech Sample Level<a name="cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-text-to-speech-sample-level-using"></a>

You can use the text\-to\-speech sample level to have the Lumberyard character Rin speak sample text that you type\. The character uses the [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) voice that you choose\. Lip sync \([viseme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viseme)\) information for the animation is generated by the gem\. The text\-to\-speech sample also displays the corresponding closed captioned text as the character speaks\.

**To run the text\-to\-speech sample**

1. In the [Project Configurator](configurator-intro.md), select the **CloudGemSamples** project and then launch Lumberyard Editor\.

1. In Lumberyard Editor, choose **File**, **Open** or press **Ctrl\+O**\.

1. In the **Open a Level** dialog box, expand **Levels**\.

1. Choose **TextToSpeechSample**, and then click **Open**\.

1. If this is the first time that you are using the **CloudGemSamples** project, follow the prompts to initialize resource manager\. You will also create a project stack and a deployment in AWS\. These operations take a few minutes\.

1. Close **Resource Manager**\.

1. Click **Play Game** or press **Ctrl\+G** to run the text\-to\-speech sample level\. The level shows the character Rin and some text boxes\.

1. If you just want to try the sample level, you can ignore the **Character \(opt\)** box for now\. To use this setting, you would first have to create a character in the Cloud Gem Portal and import the character's speech files into the sample level\. For information about creating characters, see [Text\-to\-Speech Cloud Gem Portal](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-text-to-speech-cgp.md)\.

1. For **Voice \(opt\)**, choose one of the built\-in voices\.
**Note**  
Currently you can choose from 50 Amazon Polly voices\. The default voice \(Joanna\) corresponds to US English\. If you choose a voice that corresponds to a different language, the text that you type should correspond to that language\. For a complete list of Amazon Polly voices and their corresponding languages, see [Available Voices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html) in the Amazon Polly Developer Guide\.

1. For **Input Text**, enter the text that you want rendered to speech\.

1. Click **Submit** or press **Enter**\.

The gem uses the voice that you chose to speak the text that you typed, performs Rin's lip synchronization, and shows the closed captioned text\.
