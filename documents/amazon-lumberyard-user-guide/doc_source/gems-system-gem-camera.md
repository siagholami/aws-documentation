# Camera Framework Gem<a name="gems-system-gem-camera"></a>

The Camera and Camera Framework Gems are a base upon which you can build more complex camera systems\. This gem contains the [Camera](component-camera.md) and the [Camera Rig](component-camera-rig.md), which work together to define a basic camera and its control rig\. You can customize the camera rig component through three different behaviors: 
+ Target acquiring behavior
+ Target transform modifying behaviors
+ Final camera transform modifying behaviors
