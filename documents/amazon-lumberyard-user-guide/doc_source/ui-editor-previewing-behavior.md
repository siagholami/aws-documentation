# Previewing Canvas Behavior<a name="ui-editor-previewing-behavior"></a>

In **UI Editor** **Preview**, the UI elements in your canvas perform as they would when the game is running\.

Try these examples:
+ Pause on an interactive element to show its hover state\.
+ Press \(click\) an interactive element to show its pressed state\.
+ Adjust sliders\.
+ Input and edit text\.
+ Use keyboard, mouse, or gamepad to interact with the UI\.

**Note**  
If the interactive component's **Input enabled** setting is deselected \(unchecked\), that element is drawn in its disabled state and does not respond to hover or click actions\.

## Animation List<a name="animation-list-pane"></a>

The **Animation List** pane lists all the UI animation sequences found on the canvas that you are previewing\. Select an animation to use the reset, play, pause, and set\-to\-end controls\. Hold **Ctrl** or **Shift** to select and control multiple animations at once\. You can also control animations independently and simultaneously so that one may be playing, for example, while you pause another\.

## Action Log<a name="action-log"></a>

The **Action Log** pane shows the actions generated by interacting with interactive elements in the UI canvas while in **Preview**\. These logged actions help the canvas designer ensure that correct actions are being triggered\.

To use this feature, you must type text strings in the **Actions** section of the interactive element's properties\.

**To enable Action Log entries**

1. In the **UI Editor** viewport or **Hierarchy** pane, select the element to which the interactive component is attached\. 

1. In the **Properties** pane, under the **Actions** category, enter a text string for each action for which you want to trigger an action log entry\.

   The text strings are fully customizable; you can enter any string that helps you ensure that the correct actions are being triggered\.

For example, in the picture below, **EnablerChanged** is displayed whenever the **Enable Input** check box changes state \(from off to on, or on to off\)\. **EnablerOn** is displayed when the check box is selected, and **EnablerOff** is displayed when it is deselected\.

During **Preview**, Script Canvas and Lua scripts aren't active\. Actions taken in UI canvas **Preview** have no effect on anything outside of the canvas\.
