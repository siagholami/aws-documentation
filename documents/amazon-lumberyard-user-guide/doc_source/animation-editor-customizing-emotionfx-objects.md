# Customizing EMotion FX Objects<a name="animation-editor-customizing-emotionfx-objects"></a>

****  
This feature is in [preview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#preview) release and is subject to change\. 

The EMotion FX API supports registering custom object types, including state machine nodes, blend tree nodes, transitions, and conditions\. You can define custom object types in your game code or a custom gem\. This allows you to have granular control of the Lumberyard animation system\.

## Registering Custom Objects<a name="animation-editor-registering-custom-objects"></a>

Before registering custom objects, activate the EMotion FX `SystemComponent` to ensure the EMotion FX runtime is initialized correctly\. Then use an EBus call to the `EMotionFXRequestBus::Events::RegisterAnimGraphObjectType` method\. You can ensure that EMotion FX runtime is activated by registering your custom node from a component that has a dependency on `EmotionFXAnimationService`\. You do not need to manually instantiate the EMotion FX `SystemComponent` and call `Activate`; component dependencies handle these tasks\.

**To register your custom node**

1. In your custom gem or game project code, define your subclass of `EMotionFX::AnimGraphObject`\.

1. Create a subclass of `AZ::Component`\.

1. In your component's `GetDependentServices()` method, add the dependency to `EmotionFXAnimationService`:

   ```
   dependent.push_back(AZ_CRC("EmotionFXAnimationService", 0x3f8a6369));
   ```

1. In your component's `Activate()` method, register your node type: 

   ```
   EmotionFXAnimation::EMotionFXRequestBus::Broadcast(
     &EmotionFXAnimation::EMotionFXRequestBus::Events::RegisterAnimGraphNodeType,
       MyCustomNode::Create(nullptr)
   );
   ```

## Implementing AnimGraphObject Subclasses<a name="animation-editor-implementing-animgraphobject-subclasses"></a>

`AnimGraphObject` is the base class for all objects in the animation graph\. The constructor on the base class is protected; instead, objects are instantiated with the `Create()` method\. The Lumberyard animation system \(EMotion FX\) uses an instance of `AnimGraphObject` to create other instances by calling the `Clone()` method\.

Each `AnimGraphObject` subclass has a unique type ID that is used to serialize an object to and unserialize an object from an `.animgraph` file\. You use a public anonymous enum with a `TYPE_ID` member to declare the type ID for an object\.

When implementing an `AnimGraphObject` subclass, you must define the following methods:


| Method | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| uint32 GetBaseType\(\) const | Defines the base type of an object\. There are three base types: nodes, transitions, and conditions\. | 
| const char\* GetTypeString\(\) const | Defines the string version of the object type name\. | 
| const char\* GetPaletteName\(\) const | Defines the name that is displayed in the UI\. | 
| AnimGraphObject::ECategory GetPaletteCategory\(\) const | Defines where in the UI palette or tab the object should appear\. | 
| AnimGraphObject\* Clone\(AnimGraph\* animGraph\) | Creates a new instance of the same object type, with the clone's animation graph set to animGraph\. | 
| AnimGraphObjectData\* CreateObjectData\(\) | Creates a new instance of an AnimGraphObjectData instance\. This represents data that is unique to each type of node in an AnimGraphInstance\. |
