****  
 The Input Management Framework Gem is in [preview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#preview) release and is subject to change\. 

The Input Management Framework gem provides a framework for managing cross\-platform game input such as keyboard, controller, and touch in Lumberyard with the component entity system\. 

![\[Enable the Input Management Framework gem for the Input component.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/gems/input-management-framework-gem.png)

The gem works with the [Starting Point Input](gems-system-starting-point-input.md) gem, which supplies the processed raw input\. The Input Management Framework gem then takes that input and converts it to user\-defined gameplay events with the **[Input](component-input.md)** component\. 

For an example, see [Working with the Input Component](working-with-the-input-component.md)\.
