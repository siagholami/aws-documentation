Lumberyard uses physically based lighting and shading models to implement global illumination and environment lighting\.

For information about the Light entity and the Environment Probe entity used in environment lighting, see [Light Entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/entities-entity-light.html)\.

For information about using the Time of Day Editor to simulate the changing lighting effects caused by the sun moving across the sky, see [Creating Time of Day Sky Effects](sky-tod-intro.md)\.
