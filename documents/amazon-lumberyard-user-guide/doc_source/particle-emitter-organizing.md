# Organizing Emitters in a Library<a name="particle-emitter-organizing"></a>

All particle emitters are listed in the **Libraries** panel\. You can organize and create relationships between your emitters\. For example, you can have single emitters or emitters with various child hierarchies\. You can also create directories and groups in each library to organize your particle effects\. This relationship is displayed in a tree hierarchy in the **Libraries** panel\.

A visual indicator shows you the placement of an emitter based on the position of your cursor\. For example, if you place an emitter on another emitter or a folder for grouping, the folder row appears highlighted with a blue stroke\.
