# Scene Processing Gem<a name="gems-system-gem-scene-processing"></a>

Use the Scene Processing gem to specify the default settings for processing scene files such as `.fbx` for your games\. For example, you can use the FBX Settings tool to specify the file types and settings that you want for your `.fbx` files\. Asset Processor then processes the files so that they are available in the **Asset Browser**\.

![\[The Scene Processing gem enables Lumberyard to process scene files such for your game.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/gem-system-gem-sceneprocessing.png)

**Note**  
The Scene Processing gem is required and enabled by default for Lumberyard projects\.

For information about working with file types and settings, see [FBX Soft Naming Conventions](char-fbx-importer-soft-naming.md)\.
