# Converting Entities with the Legacy Converter<a name="component-entity-data-converter"></a>

****  
This feature is in [preview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#preview) release and is subject to change\. 

The Legacy Converter converts your [legacy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#legacy) entities \(CryEntities\) to the new component entity system\. Legacy features will eventually be removed from Lumberyard Editor\. When you use the Legacy Converter, it tries to convert all legacy entities in your level\. You cannot select which entities to convert or skip\. Once an entity is converted, it cannot be converted back to a legacy entity\.

## Converting Your Legacy Entities<a name="using-the-entity-convertor-tool"></a>

If your level has legacy entities, Lumberyard Editor detects them and prompts you to convert them\.

**To convert your legacy entities**

1. Do any of the following to open the Legacy Converter:
   + If the CryEntity Removal gem is enabled, and you load a level that contains legacy entities, the Legacy Converter opens by default\. 
   + In Lumberyard Editor, choose **File**, **Upgrade Legacy Entities**\. 
**Note**  
The CryEntity Removal gem disables all legacy features in Lumberyard Editor\. For more information, see the [CryEntity Removal Gem](gems-system-cryentity-removal-gem.md)\.

1. The dialog box shows the number of legacy entities in your level\. Choose **Convert Entities**\. 

   A progress bar appears that shows the number of entities that the Legacy Converter is processing\. The conversion takes several seconds to complete\.  
![\[The conversion log shows which entities were converted and which were not in Lumberyard.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/component/entity_system/legacy-converter-entities-detected.png)

1. After the conversion completes, the dialog box shows the number of converted and unconverted entities\. See the **Status** and **Message** columns for more information\. Choose **OK**\.  
![\[The conversion log shows that entities converted and which did not in Lumberyard.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/component/entity_system/legacy-converter-conversion.png)
**Note**  
If the Legacy Converter can't convert an entity, a **Conversion Error** dialog box appears that shows the number of entities that were not converted\. If the CryEntity Removal gem is enabled, unconverted entities remain in your level but cannot be edited\. For more information, choose **View Log**\. You can also choose **Export Log** to save the conversion log as a `.csv` file\.

## List of Legacy Entity Conversions<a name="conversion-component-entity-list"></a>

The Legacy Converter converts each legacy entity to its corresponding component entity\. For a list of legacy entities, see the [Entity Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/entities-entity-library.html) in the *Amazon Lumberyard Legacy Reference*\.

Converted entities keep the same position in the viewport\. For more information, see [Using the Viewport](lumberyard-editor-viewport.md)\. 

**Note**  
Some legacy entities cannot be converted at this time\. 

See the following tables for the converted component entity\.

### Designer Objects<a name="cry-designer-objects"></a>

The Legacy Converter converts designer objects to a component entity that is attached with the following components:
+ **[Mesh](component-static-mesh.md)**
+ **[Static Physics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/component-static-physics.html)** component\.
+ **[Mesh Collider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/component-physics-mesh-collider.html)**

The Legacy Converter converts the original shape of designer objects into `.cgf` files and then saves them to your game project directory\. 


****  

| Settings in Designer Object  | Converted Settings in Mesh Component | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Geometry  |  Mesh asset \(`.cgf` file\)  | 

**Example**  

1. You have a legacy designer object named *Designer1* shaped as a sphere\.   
![\[Legacy designer object before conversion.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/component/entity_system/legacy-converter-conversion-designer-object-1.png)

1. With the Legacy Converter, you convert the object into a entity with the **Mesh**, **Static Physics**, and **Mesh Collider** components attached\.  
![\[The log shows that converted legacy designer object.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/component/entity_system/legacy-converter-conversion-designer-object-2.png)

1. The Legacy Converter creates a `.cgf` file and saves it to the `lumberyard_version\dev\game-project\Objects\DesignerConversion\level-name\` directory\.   
![\[The converted designer object is a mesh asset file.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/component/entity_system/legacy-converter-conversion-designer-object-4.png)

1. In the **Mesh** component, the **Mesh asset** property specifies this `Designer1.cgf` file\. The entity has the same shape as the original designer object\.  
![\[The converted designer object is a mesh asset file.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/component/entity_system/legacy-converter-conversion-designer-object-3.png)

**Note**  
You cannot edit a designer object after it is converted into a component entity\. You can use the legacy **Designer Tool** to create your object and convert it again\. For more information, see [Using the Designer Tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/entities-designer-tool.html) in the *Amazon Lumberyard Legacy Reference*\.

### Groups and Layers<a name="cry-groups-layers"></a>

Groups and layers are converted to empty component entities with the same names\.

Legacy entities that are nested under legacy groups or layers appear nested under the newly created component entities, which keep the same hierarchy\. 

If a legacy entity belongs to a layer and a group, the converted component entity appears under the converted group component entity\. It also appears as a child of the converted layer component entity\.

**Example**  

1. You have the following legacy entities in your level:
   + LegacyEntityA, LegacyEntityB and LegacyEntityC are grouped under LegacyGroupA, so the hierarchy appears as: LegacyGroupA \[LegacyEntityA, LegacyEntityB, LegacyEntityC\]
   + LegacyEntityA belongs to LegacyLayerA, so the hierarchy appears as: LegacyLayerA \[LegacyEntityA\]

1. You use the Legacy Converter to convert your entities\.

1. The converted entities have the following hierarchy:

   ComponentEntityLayerA \[ComponentEntityGroupA\[ComponentEntityA, ComponentEntityB, ComponentEntityC\]\]

### Light Entity<a name="cry-light-entity"></a>

A light entity with the **Planar Light** setting specified is converted to a component entity that is attached with a **[Area Light](component-area-light.md)** component\.

A light entity with the **Projector** setting specified to **Texture** is converted to a component entity attached with a **[Projector Light](component-projector-light.md) **component\.

A light entity with neither the **Planar Light** or **Projector** setting specified to **Texture** is converted to a component entity attached with a **[Point Light](component-point-light.md)** component
