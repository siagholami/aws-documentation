You can use the **LayoutFitter** component to make an element resize itself to fit its content\. Use this component with other components that provide cell sizing information, such as the **Text** component, the **Image** component \(with **ImageType** set to **Fixed**\), or the **Layout** components \(**Cell**, **Row**, **Column**, **Grid**\)\. 

To see an in\-game example of a completed canvas with the **LayoutFitter** component, open the level UiFeatures in the project SamplesProject\. Press **Ctrl\+G** to play the game, and then choose **Components**, **Layout Components**, **Layout Fitter**\. Press **Esc** to exit the game\.

To view that same canvas in the **UI Editor**, navigate to the `\Gems\LyShineExamples\Assets\UI\Canvases\LyShineExamples\Comp\Layout` directory and open the `\fitter.uicanvas` file\.
