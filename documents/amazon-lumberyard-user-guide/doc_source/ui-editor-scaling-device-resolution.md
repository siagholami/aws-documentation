# Scaling to Device Resolutions<a name="ui-editor-scaling-device-resolution"></a>

You can use the **Scale to Device** property on the **Transform2D** component with the anchoring system to build UIs that display on multiple screen resolutions\. The **Scale to Device** property applies an element scale that’s based on the ratio of the authored canvas size to the target canvas size\.

To view the effects of this computation, open the **Preview** canvas in the UI Editor\.
