Global wind and breezes affect everything in your level, such as all vegetation\. Here's how to set them up:

**To set global wind parameters**

1. In the **Rollup Bar**, under **Terrain**, click **Environment**\. 

1. Under the **EnvState** section, adjust values of the following parameters:
   + **Wind vector** – Speed and wind direction vector\. Positive x values are east; positive y values are north\.
   + **Breeze generation** – Enables breezes\.
   + **Breeze strength** – Controls the intensity of the breeze\.
   + **Breeze movement speed** – Controls the velocity of the breeze\. Use it to produce short, rapid gusts of wind\.
   + **Breeze variation** – Varies breeze speed, strength, and size\.
   + **Breeze life time** – Sets the duration of each breeze, in seconds\.
   + **Breeze count** – Sets the number of breezes generated per instance\.
   + **Breeze spawn radius** – Radius of breeze travel\. 
   + **Breeze spread** – Determines the degree of variation in breeze direction\.
   + **Breeze radius** – Sets the radius of breeze influence\.
