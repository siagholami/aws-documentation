# Previewing your Virtual Reality Project<a name="virtual-reality-preview"></a>

You can preview your virtual reality project for any project that has one or more of the virtual reality head\-mounted display gems enabled\. As you work in Lumberyard Editor, use your head\-mounted display to preview your virtual reality game\. The preview display inside of Lumberyard Editor is a preview only; it is not a good indicator of how fast the application will perform outside of the editor\.

To gauge the game performance outside of Lumberyard Editor, [create a release build](asset-bundler-tutorial-release.md) to run your game in standalone mode\.

**To preview your virtual reality project**

1. In Lumberyard Editor, click **VR Preview** on the bottom toolbar\.
