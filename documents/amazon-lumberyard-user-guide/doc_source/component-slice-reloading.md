# Slice Reloading<a name="component-slice-reloading"></a>

Slices support runtime reloading\. If a slice has changed for any reason—such as a data push operation, retrieval from source control, or manual edit—Lumberyard Editor reloads the slice asset\. Lumberyard Editor also recalculates any slice instances that were affected by the change\.
