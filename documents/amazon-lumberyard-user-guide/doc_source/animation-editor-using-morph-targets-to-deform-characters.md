# Using Morph Targets to Deform Characters<a name="animation-editor-using-morph-targets-to-deform-characters"></a>

****  
This feature is in [preview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#preview) release and is subject to change\. 

A morph target is a deformed mesh that is stored as a series of vertex positions\. Morph targets are also called blend shapes or vertex\-level deformations\. You can use morph targets to deform a character's face to animate facial expressions or a character's body part to correct undesired deformation of skinning\. You can also simulate deformation of clothing on a character\.

In the **Animation Editor**, you can use morph targets with one of the following nodes:
+ **Motion** node – Plays morph target animations similarly as skeletal animations\.
+ **Morph Target** node – Animates morph targets by changing the weight at runtime\.

## Prerequisites<a name="animation-editor-morph-targets-prerequisites"></a>

To use morph targets in the **Animation Editor**, you must do the following:
+ Prepare your asset for `.fbx` export\. For more information, see [Best Practices for Creating and Exporting Meshes](char-fbx-importer-best-practices.md)\.
+ Create and animate morph targets on your character in your DCC tool \(for example, Maya\)\.
+ Export the character as an `.fbx` file\.

## Importing Morph Targets<a name="animation-editor-importing-morph-targets"></a>

When you import an `.fbx` file into Lumberyard, all morph targets and morph target motions in that file are imported as part of the actor\. This allows you to open your actor file in the **Animation Editor** without additional steps\.

You can also change how morph targets are imported\.

**To change how morph targets are imported**

1. In the **Asset Browser**, right\-click your `.fbx` file and choose **Edit Settings**\.  
![\[Choose the Edit Settings option for your .fbx file in the Asset Browser.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/actor-animation/asset-browser-fbx-file-edit-settings.png)

1. In the **FBX Settings** window, click the **Actors** tab\.

   A modifier appears to indicate that morph targets will be imported\.

1. Click the button next to the **Select morph targets** field\.  
![\[Click the Select morph targets button on the Actors tab in the FBX Settings window.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/actor-animation/fbx-settings-select-morph-targets-button.png)

1. In the **Select nodes** window, select the morph targets that you want to import, and then click **Select**\.  
![\[Select the morph targets to import in the Select nodes window.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/actor-animation/morph-targets-select-nodes-window.png)

1. In the **FBX Settings** window, click **Update** to save your changes\.

**To change how morph target motions are imported**

1. In the **Asset Browser**, right\-click your `.fbx` file and choose **Edit Settings**\.

1. In the **FBX Settings** window, click the **Motions** tab\.
**Note**  
If you have morph target animations in your `.fbx` file, a modifier appears to indicate that morph target motions will be imported\. You can remove the modifier if you do not want the morph target motions in your `.motion` file\.  
![\[Motions tab in the FBX Settings window.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/actor-animation/fbx-settings-motions-tab.png)
