You can create and place roads using the Road entity as follows\.

When performing this procedure, you may notice that parts of the road disappear into the terrain\. The **Align Height Map** step resolves this by stretching the terrain height to match the path of the road based on its shape and on **BorderWidth** parameter\. For information on **BorderWidth** and related settings, see [Road Entity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/entities-entity-road.html)\.

**To create and place the Road entity**

1. In the **Rollup Bar**, on the **Objects** tab, click **Misc**, **Road**\.

1. In your level, start at the beginning of the road and click to place a series of points that define the roadâ€™s path\.

1. When complete, double\-click where you want the road to end\.

1. In the **Rollup Bar**, under **Road Parameters**, click **Align Height Map** to adjust the terrain height to match the path of the road\.
