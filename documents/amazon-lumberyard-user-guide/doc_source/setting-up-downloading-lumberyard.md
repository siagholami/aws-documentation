+ Lumberyard Editor

If you have an existing Lumberyard project and you want to upgrade, see [Upgrading Lumberyard](lumberyard-upgrading.md)\.

**Note**  
If you get file errors during extraction about `AssetProcessor.exe`, `AssetProcessor_temp.exe`, or `CrySystem.dll`, verify if your antivirus software is placing these files in quarantine\. If needed, grant exceptions for the affected files\.
