# Packaging Your Assets<a name="gems-system-gems-packaging"></a>

Before you can include your assets in your new gem, you must place them within your Lumberyard's game project root directory\. This way, they will be imported by Lumberyard Asset Pipeline and converted into assets that Lumberyard can use\. After you move and import your assets, you must test them in Lumberyard to ensure that they still work as intended\. You then move the verified assets into the gem directory structure that was created when you created a new gem\.

**Tip**  
To avoid conflicts with similarly named assets, we recommend that you use a namespace workflow or acronyms when you create directories that contain assets in gems\.   
For example, you can add a directory between `Assets` and `Textures` so that the directory doesn't conflict with other gems that might have identically named textures\. Your structure might look like the following:   
`lumberyard_version\dev\Gems\gem_name\Assets\example_name\Textures\CommonTextureName.tif`

**To package your assets**

1. Prepare your asset directory\.

   1. Create a directory directly beneath your game project's root directory\. For example, the **Samples Project**'s game project root directory is `\dev\SamplesProject`\.

   1. Place into the new directory your assets and any related files and subdirectories containing files that your assets use, such as textures\. Ensure that you maintain the original directory structure within the asset directory to avoid breaking relative file paths in your assets\.

   1. If preferred, you can create additional subdirectories for organization purposes\. Be sure to amend any file references that may be broken by the new structure\.

1. Import the assets into Lumberyard\. To do this, launch Lumberyard\. The Asset Processor automatically detects the new assets and imports them\.

1. Verify and test the assets\.

   1. In Lumberyard, open a level and find your asset directory in the **Asset Browser**\. If the **Asset Browser** is not open, click **Tools**, **Asset Browser** to open it\.

   1. Drag your assets into the level and verify that they look and function as intended\. If necessary, make changes to the assets, such as assigning textures or changing materials\.

   1. Save any changes that you made to your assets and close Lumberyard\.

1. Move the contents of your asset's root directory that you created in Step 1\. Be sure to include the metadata files generated by the Asset Processor\. Place the contents into the new gem's `Assets` directory\. This is located at `\dev\Gems\gem_name\Assets`\.
**Note**  
The Gem's `Assets` directory maps to the root of your project folder\. For example, if your asset is in `\dev\project_name\my_asset\`, then it maps to the gem at `\dev\Gems\my_gem\Assets\my_asset\`\.
