# Lumberyard UI 2\.0 Developer Documentation<a name="ui20"></a>

Introduced with Amazon Lumberyard version 1\.25, UI 2\.0 is the user interface framework used by Lumberyard's editors and tools\. It uses the C\+\+ Qt UI library and can be extended to support your own customizations and modifications\.

## What is Lumberyard UI 2\.0?<a name="what-is-ui20"></a>

UI 2\.0 is designed to enable easy\-to\-use workflows and help your game designers and developers translate their ideas into quick simulations\. When developing the new LumberyardUI, we focused on these four tenets: 
+ Efficiency
+ Accessibility
+ Familiarity
+ Modularity

To achieve this, we provided a complete set of Qt\-based user interface building blocks so that you can create tools to fit your own needs, while still employing a coherent and standardized UI experience throughout the Lumberyard Editor\.

When creating tools, developers have access to the controls that we're now using throughout Lumberyard, which includes the following elements:
+ Breadcrumbs
+ Browse edit *\(input field with button\)*
+ Button
+ Card
+ Check box / toggle switch
+ Color picker and color label 
+ Combo box
+ Filtered search widget
+ Gradient slider
+ Hyperlinks
+ Line edit
+ Menu
+ Progress indicators
+ Radio buttons
+ Reflected property editor
+ Scrollbar
+ Segment control
+ Slider
+ Sliders with combo box
+ Spin\-box *\(Line edit with drag support\)*
+ Vector input spin\-box
+ Splitter
+ Styled dock widget
+ Tabs
+ Table view
+ Toolbar
+ Tree view
+ Typography

## UI 2\.0 overview<a name="ui20-overview"></a>

 With Lumberyard 1\.25 and later versions, developers can use Lumberyard’s custom Qt widget library to create their own developer tools and modify existing tools to blend into the user experience of the rest of the Lumberyard Editor\. We have provided a set of styles and user interaction patterns that are applied on top of the Qt framework, which is the C\+\+ based library Lumberyard relies on for its UI\. For many of the basic components \(such as check boxes, push buttons, and line edits\), use the base Qt widgets \(such as QCheckBox, QPushButton, QLineEdit\) and the custom styling and behavior is applied automatically\. Components that require extended functionality or are unique to Lumberyard are custom classes that can be subclassed and can include a combination of Qt widgets\. In these cases, the class definitions live in this folder: *//dev/Code/Framework/AzQtComponents/AzQtComponents/Components/\.*

## Review the UI 2\.0 components<a name="ui20-components"></a>

Before you begin, make sure that you have Lumberyard 1\.25 installed on your machine\.

**To review the UI components**

1. Open File Explorer and go to your build directory\. \(For example, **C:\\\{your\-lumberyard\-installation\-path\}\\\{version\}\\dev\\Bin64vc141\\**\)  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/ui/ui20-qt-control-gallery-file.jpg)

1. Double\-click on **AmazonQtControlGallery\.exe** to open the `UI 2.0 Qt Control Gallery` app\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/ui/ui20-qt-control-gallery-main.jpg)

1. Use the main dropdown menu to navigate through the pages\. For each component, the right column shows a live example of how the widget will look and work inside the Lumberyard Editor or for your tool\. The left column displays the code used to produce that result\.
**Note**  
The Gallery does not cover how to set up a window for your tool, or the basics of how the Qt library works\. Its primary objective is to illustrate the attributes of the Lumberyard Component Gallery\.

## How UI 2\.0 works<a name="how-ui20-works"></a>

The Lumberyard UI is built upon [Qt Style Sheets](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet.html), which is a powerful mechanism for customizing the appearance of widgets\. The concepts and syntax are similar to Cascading Style Sheets \(CSS\)\.

In Qt Style Sheets, the `AzQtComponents` module has a `StyleManager` class, which installs a custom [QProxyStyle class](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qproxystyle.html) at the application level\. The QProxyStyle class overrides the styling of all widgets with custom styling\. This is how you can use a basic Qt widget \(such as QPushButton or QCheckBox\) and give it the custom styling\.

The **StyleManager** class is pre\-loaded with a series of base style sheets, starting with *Code/Framework/AzQtComponents/AzQtComponents/Components/Widgets/BaseStyleSheet\.qss*\.

This style sheet applies custom styling for each individual widget, each of which is separated into files such as “*CheckBox\.qss*” and “*PushButton\.qss*”\. This styling is applied down through the entire widget hierarchy, starting from the top application layer\. Additional custom style sheets can be applied at lower levels \(such as in your own custom tool\) that only affects that widget and any of its children\.

## Get started with UI 2\.0 development<a name="ui20-get-started"></a>

Depending on your tools and existing code, accessing the new library of components might require some initial setup\.

If your tool is part of the core Lumberyard Editor or is part of a gem, but uses the Lumberyard Editor’s Qt Application, you're already set up and ready to go\. Just include the header for the component that you need to use from the //dev/*Code/Framework/AzQtComponents/AzQtComponents/Components/* folder\. If Visual Studio is raising errors, make sure *'AzQtComponents'* is listed in the `use` and `include` sections in the `wscript` file, as shown in the following example\.

```
def build(bld):
    bld.DefineGem(
        editor = dict(
            use = ['AzQtComponents'],
            ...
        )
    )
```

For standalone tools with their own Qt Application, you must take some extra steps to make sure that the new styling is applied correctly\. 

**To apply new styling for standalone tools**

1. Set the attributes to correctly handle high DPI screens before creating the QApplication\.

   ```
   #include <QApplication>
   
   QCoreApplication::setAttribute(Qt::AA_EnableHighDpiScaling);
   QCoreApplication::setAttribute(Qt::AA_UseHighDpiPixmaps);
   QGuiApplication::setHighDpiScaleFactorRoundingPolicy(Qt::HighDpiScaleFactorRoundingPolicy::PassThrough);
   AzQtComponents::Utilities::HandleDpiAwareness(AzQtComponents::Utilities::PerScreenDpiAware);
   
   QApplication app(argc, argv);
   ```

1. Create the StyleManager, which loads the style sheets and custom settings for the new UI\.

   ```
   #include <AzQtComponents/Components/StyleManager.h>
   
   AzQtComponents::StyleManager* styleManager = new AzQtComponents::StyleManager(this);
   const bool useLegacyStyle = false;
   styleManager->initialize(app, useLegacyStyle);
   ```

   The StyleManager automatically loads the base style sheets, but you can add other resources as well\. See [the Qt Style sheets page of the ****](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet.html) for more information\.

## UI 2\.0 Best Practices<a name="ui20-best-practices"></a>

Writing code to extend the core Lumberyard Editor? Here are some suggestions to comply with the UI guidelines:
+ The UI styling uses an AWS standard color palette, which includes grays and blues\. Creating a custom style and color override will have your tool looking inconsistent with the rest of the Lumberyard Editor\. We suggest avoiding custom style overrides whenever possible so that Lumberyard appears as one cohesive application\.
+ The Editor now supports vector file formats for icons, which prevents them from appearing blurry or pixelated on high DPI displays\. Make sure to use SVG files for your icons, and replace old PNGs and JPGs with vector graphics images in existing tools if possible\.
+ Moving forward, we want to make sure the user experience is cohesive and familiar throughout the whole Lumberyard Editor\. You should avoid making one\-off custom changes; and when you add new features, add them to the library so that they are available to the whole Editor instead of just a single tool\.
+ Avoid subclassing or encapsulating the widgets from the component library\. If you need some specific behavior, check our resources to verify if it's already available in the component library via specific settings\.

## UI 2\.0 Frequently Asked Questions<a name="ui20-faq"></a>

**Question: Can I copy the code example directly from the AmazonQtControlGallery?**
+ **Answer:** Yes\. Please note that variations of the API controls and sub\-options are being documented, but some settings might still not be covered in the executable\.

**Question: What about visual and color modifications to the controls?**
+ We do not endorse custom modifications to the layout and visual design as we want to support an experience that feels unified across all of our tooling\. Nonetheless, sometimes minor spacing and style adjustments may be needed: see[ the Qt Style sheets page of the **AmazonQtControlGallery**](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet.html) for more information on how to load a custom QSS style sheet\.

**Question: Why should I use the existing widget styling instead of creating my own?**
+ Over the past several years, we have listened to feedback from all kinds of customers who are building games with Lumberyard, and one common note was that the user experience across the different tools of the Editor felt fragmented\. The component library was built with this feedback in mind, and aims to bring unified and coherent standards to the whole Editor\.

  On the development side, this solution allows for better modularity and code reuse, with the objective of reducing the work needed from developers to create interfaces\. Unifying the UI controls also allows improvements to be easily shared, since the whole Editor automatically uses them once applied, and likewise reduces the possibility of issues during library updates or core changes\.

**Question: Why should I not create subclasses or encapsulate the existing widgets?**
+ The component library aims to simplify development and streamline the user experience\. By subclassing or encapsulating the UI components to change their behavior or add features, special cases are added to the code base\. These cases would then need special documentation and testing to avoid regressions\. Subclassing or encapsulating UI components provides very little benefit, compared to keeping all UI components together in one place\.

  Subclassing is also detrimental to discoverability, since it is much harder for a new developer to find, import and re\-use code that was built specifically in a tool without creating new dependencies or duplicating code\. In the past, this has lead to multiple tools creating their own special controls that did very similar things, but in wildly different ways that made it hard to unify them and verify their behavior\.
