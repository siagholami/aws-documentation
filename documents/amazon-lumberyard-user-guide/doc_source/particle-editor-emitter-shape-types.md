# Working with Emitter Shape Types<a name="particle-editor-emitter-shape-types"></a>

The Particle Editor provides emitter shape types that you can use to achieve a variety of effects, such as using the **Beam** emitter to create fire effects\.

**To choose the emitter shape type**

1. In Lumberyard Editor, choose **Tools**, **Particle Editor**\.

1. In the **Libraries** panel, choose an emitter\.

1. In the **Attributes** panel, choose **Emitter**\. 

1. For **Emitter Shape Type**, choose the shape type\. The following emitter shape types are supported:
   + **Angle**
   + **Beam**
   + **Box**
   + **Circle**
   + **Point**
   + **Sphere**
   + **Trail**

Most emitters have CPU and GPU particle types\. Each emitter's velocity functions on either world or shape axial coordinates, based on type\. To view the shape XYZ coordinates, right\-click the **Preview** viewport and choose **Show Emitter Shape**\.
