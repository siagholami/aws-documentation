# Creating levels and adding environment effects<a name="level-intro"></a>

A level, also known as world or map, represents the space or area available to the player during the course of completing a discrete game objective\. Most games consist of multiple levels through which a player can advance to or move through, although usually only a single level is loaded at a time\. Each level can be grouped into multiple layers, which you use to logically group types of objects\.

The environment includes lighting, terrain, bodies of water, vegetation, sky, and weather effects\.
