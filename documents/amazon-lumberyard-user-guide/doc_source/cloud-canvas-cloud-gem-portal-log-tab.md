# Using the Cloud Gem Portal to View Logs<a name="cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-portal-log-tab"></a>

****  
 The Cloud Gem Portal \(CGP\) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Lumberyard\. 

You can view [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/) for your cloud gems in the **Log** tab of the Cloud Gem Portal\. CloudWatch Logs is an AWS service that monitors log activity related to your application's use of cloud gems\. For example, you can view the [Player Account](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-player-account.md) cloud gem logs related to a sign up failure\.

CloudWatch Logs arranges logs into log streams and log groups\. A log stream is a sequence of log events that share the same source\. Each separate source of logs into CloudWatch Logs makes up a separate log stream\.

A log group is a group of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings\. You can define log groups and specify which streams to put into each group\. There is no limit on the number of log streams that can belong to one log group\. For more information, see [Working with Log Groups and Log Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Working-with-log-groups-and-streams.html) in the *[Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/)*\.

You can use the **Log** tab of the Cloud Gem Portal to view log streams and log groups related to your cloud gems\.

## Prerequisites<a name="cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-portal-log-tab-prerequisites"></a>

This tutorial assumes the following:
+ You are using a Lumberyard project that has the [Leaderboard](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-leaderboard.md) and [Message of the Day](cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-message-of-the-day.md) cloud gems enabled\.
+ You have used Lumberyard's Cloud Canvas Resource Manager or the [`lmbr_aws`](cloud-canvas-command-line.md) command line tool to create a project stack and a deployment stack in AWS\.

If you don't meet the prerequisites, follow the steps in [Enabling Gems](gems-system-using-project-configurator.md) to add cloud gems to your project\. For information on creating a project stack and a deployment stack, see [Tutorial: Getting Started with Cloud Canvas](cloud-canvas-tutorial.md)\.

### Multiple Log Groups<a name="cloud-canvas-cloud-gem-portal-log-tab-multiple-log-groups"></a>

A log group is a group of log streams\. When a cloud gem like Leaderboard contains more than one log group, the log groups are displayed in multiple sections on the same page\.

**To choose a log group to view**

1. Click the **Cloud Watch Groups** drop\-down menu, and then select the log group that you want to see\.
