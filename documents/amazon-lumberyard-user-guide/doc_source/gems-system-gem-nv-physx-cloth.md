Cloth simulations are created through a familiar, intuitive component that you can add to entities that contain **Mesh** or **Actor** components\. To make the **Cloth** component available in Lumberyard, you must build and configure your project with the NVIDIA Cloth Gem enabled\. 

**To enable the NVIDIA Cloth Gem**

1. Use Project Configurator to add the NVIDIA Cloth Gem to your project\. 
**Note**  
The NVIDIA Cloth Gem also requires the **LmbrCentral** and **EmotionFX** gems\. 

1. Configure your project\. Use the following command\.

   ```
   lmbr_waf configure
   ```

1. Build your project\. Use the following command\.

   ```
   lmbr_waf build_win_x64_vs2019_profile -p all --progress
   ```
