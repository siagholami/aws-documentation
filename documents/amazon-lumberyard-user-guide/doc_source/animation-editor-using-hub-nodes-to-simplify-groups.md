# Simplify Node Groups with Hub Nodes<a name="animation-editor-using-hub-nodes-to-simplify-groups"></a>

****  
This feature is in [preview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#preview) release and is subject to change\. 

The **Hub** node acts as a connection point between groups of nodes in an animation graph\. This pass\-through node outputs or forwards the pose of the node that entered it\. Hub nodes reduce the complexity of transitions by acting as the central point in a state machine\. By connecting multiple nodes to hubs, you can combine transition lines that share the same transition conditions and strategically organize nodes to create an easy\-to\-read state machine\.

**Example**  
The following animation graph has many groups and transitions\.

The same graph with **Hub** nodes simplifies transitions between the groups, which makes the graph cleaner and easier to read\.

**To use Hub nodes in your animation graph**

1. Add a **Hub** node in an animation graph by doing one of the following:
   + In the **Anim Graph Palette**, choose the **Sources** tab and drag **Hub** to the graph\.
   + In the graph, right\-click and choose **Create Node**, **Sources**, **Hub**\.  
![\[Use the Anim Graph Palette or the graph's context menu to place a Hub node in the Anim Graph.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/actor-animation/animation-editor-using-hub-nodes-palette.png)

1. Repeat to add as many **Hub** nodes as you need\.

1. Add multiple like nodes, such as motion nodes or state machines, between the **Hub** nodes and create transitions\.  
**Example**  

   Transitions between motions are simplified by placing them between two **Hub** nodes\.  
![\[Add multiple like nodes between the two Hub nodes to simplify transitions.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/actor-animation/animation-editor-using-hub-nodes-example.png)

   In the example, the transition between **attack01** and **Hub0** is a shared transition\. If you remove the **Hub0** node, you would then individually add those two conditions from **attack01** to each of the four transitions going into the **attack01**\* nodes\.

1. For all transitions entering a **Hub** node, set its **Transition Time** to `0.0` seconds\. This ensures that an extra delay is not added to the transition\.  
![\[Set the Transition Time of any transitions entering a Hub node to 0.0 to prevent introducing extra delays.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/actor-animation/animation-editor-using-hub-nodes-transitiontime.png)
