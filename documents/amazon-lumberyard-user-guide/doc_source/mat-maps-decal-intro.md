# Working with Decals<a name="mat-maps-decal-intro"></a>

Decals are non\-repeating images or textures that are applied to the surface of an object or terrain with a specified projection\. Common examples of decals are product labels and logos, artwork for walls, signs, and surface cracks\. 

Decals can break up uninteresting textures and bring together such level elements as brushes and terrain\. Good decal placement can also create seamless transitions between many different objects\. Decals only work with the [Illum Shader](shader-ref-illum.md)\. 

**Note**  
If you apply decals to an object that can be moved by a player, the decal will not move with the object\.
