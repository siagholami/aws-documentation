Expanding Vegetation Coverage
After you create a vegetation patch, you can expand it so that your vegetation covers the entire level.
To expand vegetation coverage


Create an entity and name it WorldBox.


Click Add Component and select the Box Shape component.


In the Box Shape component, specify values for the x-, y-, and z-axes to match your level. For example, if you created a level with a texture dimension of 512 x 512, specify similar values such as 512.0, 512.0, and 64.0.



Select the BasicCoverage entity.


On the Vegetation Reference Shape component, for Shape Entity Id, select the WorldBox entity.

Example 


The vegetation appears for the entire level. As you move through the level, the vegetation dynamically appears.
