Actor

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
You can use the Actor component to create characters for your game. After you import your character files from your DCC tool into Lumberyard, you can create an entity and add the Actor component to it. For example, you must use an Actor component to create a controllable character for your game.
For the Actor component to work properly, you must also add one of the following:
 Simple Motion component – Uses a single motion for your actor.
 AnimGraph component – Uses an animation graph to control your actor's behavior.
