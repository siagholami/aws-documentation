Setting Displacement Mapping Parameters
To apply displacement mapping to an object


In Lumberyard Editor, click Tools, Material Editor.


In the left tree, select the desired asset.


In the right pane, under Shader Generation Params, select Displacement mapping.


Under Shader Params, adjust the values of the following parameters for the desired effect.


Displacement bias – Moves the plane where the displacement is applied. This reduces gaps in meshes, and prevents objects from displacing other objects that are placed above them.


Displacement height scale – Changes the overall height of the displacement.
