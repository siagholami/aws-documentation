Painting Terrain Texture Layers

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
Lumberyard uses two components for painting terrain texture layers:
 The first is a low-resolution texture with color information. This texture is visible from a distance and provides underlying color information for the base terrain texture. This texture should be less than 512 x 512 pixels in size.
 The second is a high-resolution material. This material is visible at close distances and can have several texture maps like diffuse, bump, and specular. The diffuse map should be set to white (255).
The distance at which low-resolution textures are replaced with those of a higher resolution is defined by the DetailLayersViewDistRatio parameter. To access this parameter, in the Rollup Bar, on the Terrain tab, click Environment and adjust the value as needed.
To paint a terrain texture layer


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Game, Terrain, Paint Layers.


In the Rollup Bar, on the Terrain tab, click Layer Painter.


Adjust the terrain brush settings as needed.
Radius
Specifies the size of the brush. Use the slider to adjust the size, or use the following keyboard shortcuts: [ to increase the brush radius size or ] to decrease the brush radius size.
Color Opacity
Specifies the strength of the brush when applying the layer color. The brush is a spray brush that uses the color opacity value to determine the opacity at the center of the brush. The opacity decreases to transparent at the edge of the brush. Lower values create a more translucent brush, and higher values create a more opaque brush. Set the value to 0 to disable the color opacity. You can use the slider to adjust the opacity level, or you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:
    Shift[ decreases the opacity.
    Shift] increases the opacity.
You can also use the following keyboard shortcuts to adjust both parameters simultaneously with the same value:
    ShiftCtrl[ decreases both color opacity and detail intensity.
    ShiftCtrl] increases both color opacity and detail intensity.
Detail Intensity
Specifies the strength of the brush when applying the detail texture to the layer. Like color opacity, the detail intensity value determines the intensity (opacity) at the center of the brush. The opacity decreases to transparent at the edge of the brush. Lower values create a more translucent (less intense) texture, and higher values create a more opaque texture. Set the value to 0 to disable detail intensity. You can use the slider to adjust the intensity level, or you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:
    Ctrl[ decreases the intensity.
    Ctrl] increases the intensity.
You can also use the following keyboard shortcuts to adjust both parameters simultaneously with the same value:
    ShiftCtrl[ decreases both color opacity and detail intensity.
    ShiftCtrl] increases both color opacity and detail intensity.
Mask by Layer Altitude and Slope
Sets the material to paint only between the layer Altitude and Slope parameters defined below.
Mask by
Selects a layer to prevent it from being painted over.


Adjust the layer brush settings as needed.
Brightness
Modifies the brightness of the material base color. Click the Color box to open up the color selector and alter the base color of your material. Click Save Layer when done.
Altitude
Sets a minimum and maximum altitude mask for painting; the brush applies only within these boundaries.
Slope (degrees)
Sets a minimum and maximum slope mask for painting; the brush applies only within these boundaries.
