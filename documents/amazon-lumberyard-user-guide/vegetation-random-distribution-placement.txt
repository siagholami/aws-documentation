Random Placement Using the Vegetation Distribution Filter
The Vegetation Distribution Filter component creates the look of random placement by limiting the amount of vegetation that the Vegetation Layer Spawner component produces.
Before completing the following procedure, you must have the following:
 At least one asset defined in your vegetation layer.
 An entity that contains a gradient component. For instructions, see Creating a Gradient Entity.
To create random distribution


In the Entity Outliner, select the entity that contains the Vegetation Layer Spawner component.


In the Entity Inspector, click Add Component and select Vegetation Distribution Filter.


In the Vegetation Distribution Filter component's properties, next to Gradient Entity Id, click the target button.


In the Entity Outliner, select the Gradient entity.


(Optional) Adjust the values for Threshold Min and Threshold Max to specify how much of the gradient can appear in the vegetation.
