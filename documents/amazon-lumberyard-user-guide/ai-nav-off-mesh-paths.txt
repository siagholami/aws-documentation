Using AI Paths for Navigation

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
An AI path is a control object that is used to guide an AI agent from point to point along a specified route in a level. AI paths are useful for AI agents that need to traverse between two navigation meshes. 
To create an AI Path


In the Rollup Bar, click AI, AIPath.


Under AIPath Params, set properties and parameter values as needed:


Road – Used for CRoadNavRegion::CreateRoad and road navigation. Links with other nearby roads for land-based vehicles.


ValidatePath – If enabled, the path displays validation information when selected.


Closed – If true, the path is a loop.


Click File, Export to Lumberyard. This is a necessary step for the navigation system.


Unless absolutely necessary, AI path navigation should be Uninterruptable, meaning nothing should disrupt or block an AI agent moving along a path.
