You can import assets even if Lumberyard isn't running. You can do this at any time.
To import assets manually


Navigate to your game project directory, such as lumberyard_version/dev/My_Game_Project/Objects.


Copy or move the assets to your game project directory. For example, you can add your .cgf files to the specified directory.
    If Asset Processor is running, it detects the new files and converts them for use in Lumberyard Editor.
    If Asset Processor isn't running, Asset Processor automatically detects the new files the next time you start Lumberyard Editor.

Note
You can import assets to a directory only in the current game project.
