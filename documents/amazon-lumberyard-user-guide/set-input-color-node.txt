Set Input Color
Sets the value of an input parameter as a color. The color channels are assumed to be floating point, including an alpha channel. Use this node with the Float4 substance data type. 
Note
You can use this node with all substance data types: Float1 through Float4 and Integer1 through Integer4. However, if the input parameter has fewer dimensions, the extra dimensions are ignored. 
If the input parameter is an integer type, the numbers that you specify are rounded down to the nearest integer value (for example, a value of 4.7 resolves to 4). For example, if you use a 50% gray opaque color to set a Float4, this results in a value of (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0). If you use the same color to set an Integer4, this results in a value of (0, 0, 0, 1).
