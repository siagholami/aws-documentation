Clone
Creates a copy of the specified material. The material must already be loaded into memory, so that the node can find the material. If the material is not found, the node returns Invalid.

In some cases, you might need to store the material to use later. For more information, see Material Variables.
Warning
Don't trigger this node for every frame. Each time the In event is received, a copy of the material is created.
