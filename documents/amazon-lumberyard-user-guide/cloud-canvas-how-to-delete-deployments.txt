Deleting Cloud Canvas Deployments and Their Resources
To remove Cloud Canvas functionality from your Lumberyard project and the AWS resources related to it, you can use Cloud Canvas Resource Manager or the Cloud Canvas command line. 
Warning
Only administrators should perform these actions. If you remove all AWS resources managed by Cloud Canvas for your Lumberyard project, the players of your game will not be able to access any of the Cloud Canvas resource groups that implement your game's cloud connected features.
To use Cloud Canvas Resource Manager to delete Cloud Canvas deployments and their resources


If you have checked Lumberyard into source control, ensure that the <root>\<game>\AWS\project-settings.json file has been checked out and is writeable.


In Lumberyard Editor, choose AWS, Cloud Canvas, Cloud Canvas Resource Manager.


In the Cloud Canvas configuration navigation pane, expand Administration (advanced), and then expand Deployments. The list of the deployments in the project appears.


Select the deployment to delete and click Delete deployment.



When prompted to confirm, click Yes to start the process of deleting the deployment’s resources from AWS. The process might take a few minutes.


To remove all of the project's resources from AWS, follow the same steps to delete each of the project’s deployments.


To use the command line to delete Cloud Canvas deployments and their resources


If you have checked Lumberyard into source control, ensure that the <root>\<game>\AWS\project-settings.json file has been checked out and is writeable.


Open a command line prompt and change to your the Lumberyard \dev directory.


Determine the project’s deployment names by entering the following command: 


lmbr_aws deployment list

Enter the following command for each of the deployments that you want to delete:

lmbr_aws deployment delete --deployment <deployment name>
Note
To remove all Cloud Canvas functionality from your project, use the delete-deployment command to delete all of deployments that were listed by list-deployments. Then remove the project stack as described in the step that follows.

After you have deleted all deployments, you can delete the resources that Cloud Canvas uses to manage your project by entering the following command: 

lmbr_aws project delete
This removes all AWS resources that are related to your Cloud Canvas project.
