Auto-Disable
You can save CPU time by not updating distant AI agents. Use the auto-disable feature to controlled updates either on a per-AI basis or globally.
Global auto-disable

To control auto-disable for all vehicles: use the console variable v_autoDisable.
To control auto-disable for all AI agents: use the console variable ai_UpdateAllAlways.

Per-AI auto-disable
Per-AI auto-disable is controlled by the entity property AutoDisable. You can also change this property (and behavior) at run time.
 C: pAIActorProxy->UpdateMeAlways(true);
 Lua: AI.AutoDisable(entity.id, 1);
