UI System Localization Features
By default, all Text component values are passed to the Localization Manager for localizing. If the value of a Text component matches a localization key for the currently loaded language, then the localized text is rendered.
For an example, open the Samples Project. In the UI Editor, load the following UI canvas: dev/Gems/LyShineExamples/Assets/UI/Canvases/LyShineExamples/Localization/Text.uicanvas.
You can quickly test a UI canvas that contains localized text. To change the current language in the UI Editor, choose View, Set Current Language.
