Woodland Asset Package â€“ Legacy

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
The Woodland asset package includes free wilderness assets that you can use to create a forest scene or populate your own levels with vegetation and other natural features that might be found in a woodlands scene. The Woodland assets are static art assets; therefore, you will not need to recompile your project after adding these assets.
Note
This package is compatible with Lumberyard 1.9 and earlier.
To install the Woodland asset package


Download the Woodland Asset Package at Lumberyard Previous Versions and extract it in the \dev\Gems\AssetCollection_Woodland directory at the root of your Lumberyard installation. You may need to create this folder or rename the extracted folder.
