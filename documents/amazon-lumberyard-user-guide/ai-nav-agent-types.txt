Selecting an AI Navigation Type

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
Each AI agent needs to have a navigation type assigned, either animate (human-based) or inanimate (vehicle-based). The following AI agent properties are relevant from a navigation perspective:
 AgentType - MediumSizedCharacters or VehicleMedium
 voxelSize - 0.125m x 0.125m x 0.125m minimum
 radius - agent radius, in voxels
 climbableHeight - maximum climbable height of maximum slope, in voxels
 maxWaterHeight - maximum walkable water depth, in voxels
To assign a navigation type for an AI agent


In Lumberyard Editor, click Tools, Other, DataBase View.


On the Entity Library tab, click the Load Library button and select your asset file.


Under Class Properties pane, for Navigation Type, make a selection. This sets the navigation type for all AI agents.


In Rollup Bar, under Objects, AI, NavigationArea, NavigationArea Params, make a selection.
