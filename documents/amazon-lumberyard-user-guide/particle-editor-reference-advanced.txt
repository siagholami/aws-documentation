Advanced Attribute
In the Advanced attribute, specify advanced appearance and optimization settings.

Advanced Attribute Parameters 



Name
Description




Force Generation
(CPU only) Adds a force that is generated by the emitter.[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Fill Rate Cost
(CPU only) Multiplies the emitter's contribution to the total fill rate. This affects automatic culling of large particles when the global limit is reached. Set this to a value greater than 1 if the effect is relatively expensive or unimportant. Set this to a value less than or equal to 0 if the effect is important. You should not experience automatic culling. Valid values: 0Default value: 1


Heat Scale
(CPU only) Multiplies thermal vision. Valid values: 0 to 4Default value: 0


Sort Quality
(CPU only) Specifies more accurate sorting of new particles in the emitter's list. To avoid the popping that results from changing the render particle order, particles are never re-sorted after emission. Instead they are sorted only when emitted, based on the main camera's position. [See the AWS documentation website for more details]Valid values: 0 to 2Default value: 0


Half Res
Renders particles in a separate, half resolution pass, reducing rendering cost.  To enable this parameter, set the r_ParticlesHalfRes console variable to 1.  For more information, see Using the Console Window. Default value: false


Streamable
(CPU only) Allows texture or geometry assets to stream from storage as normal. Default value: true


Particle Size Discard
(GPU only) Discards particles below the defined screen space pixel size. Valid values: 0 to 255Default value: 0


Depth of Field Blur
(GPU only) Blurs particles against depth of field full screen effects. This excludes geometry and decal types. Default value: false


Spherical Volume
(CPU only) Simulates adding spherical volume to the particle and multiplies particle size to define the volume. Default value: 1
