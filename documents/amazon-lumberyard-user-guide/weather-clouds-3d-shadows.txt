Adding 3D Cloud Shadows

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
3D clouds don't actually cast real-time shadows. Instead a moveable texture is imposed on the entire level, creating the illusion that the clouds cast shadows.
