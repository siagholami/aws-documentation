Multiplayer Gem CVars
For convenience, the Multiplayer Gem provides the following console variable commands that you can use to test features or configurations.
Client CVars
mphost 
Creates a GridSession using the LANSessionService on the local machine. The optional port number determines the port on which the grid session runs.
mpjoin  
Performs a GridSearch using the LANSessionService and joins the first session returned. The server address and port number are optional parameters that can be used to refine the GridSearch.
mpsearch
Performs a GridSearch using the LANSessionService.
mpdisconnect
Disconnects the local client from its active GridSession, if any.
gm_version
Sets the GridMate version number.
gm_netsec_enable
Specifies whether encryption is used for connections. The default is false.
If encryption parameters are not present or invalid, the connection for the session is not encrypted.
gm_netsec_private_key
Specifies the private key file (PEM format) for a secure network connection when FileDataSource is used as a certificate manager. This setting overrides any previously configured values in FileDataSource. If network encryption is enabled, this value must be set on the host of a GridSession when the session is created. This setting is disabled in release builds.
gm_netsec_certificate
Specifies the private key file (PEM format) for a secure network connection when FileDataSource is used as a certificate manager. This setting overrides any previously configured values in FileDataSource. If network encryption is enabled, this value must be set on the host of a GridSession when the session is created. This setting is disabled in release builds.
gm_netsec_ca
Specifies the CA Certificate file (PEM format) for a secure network connection when the FileDataSoruce is used as a certificate manager. This setting overrides any previously configured values in FileDataSource. This value must be set on the client when trying to join a GridSession using encryption. This setting is disabled in release builds.
gm_netsec_verify_client
Enables client verification. If not enabled, only the server is authenticated. Must be set on the host of a GridSession. The default is false.
gm_disconnectDetection
Sets whether disconnect detection is enabled for a particular GridSession. Must be set on the host of GridSession. If disconnect detection is enabled, clients that do not respond to inquiries within the timeout window are disconnected. The default is true.
gm_disconnectDetectionRttThreshold
A RTT threshold, in milliseconds, that specifies the time after which a connection is dropped when there is no response. The default is 500.
gm_disconnectDetectionPacketLossThreshold
A value between 0 and 1 that represents the percentage of packets that are permitted to be lost in communication with a particular client. If a client experiences a packet loss greater than the specified value, the connection is dropped. The default is 0.3.
gm_recvPacketsLimit
The maximum number of packets per second allowed to be received from an existing connection. The default is 0 (no limit).
gm_ipversion
Specifies which Internet protocol version to use. Possible values are IPv4 or IPv6. The default is IPv4.
gm_securityData
Specifies the security data for session. 
gm_replicasSendTime
Specifies, in milliseconds, the time interval between replica updates. A value of 0 binds the interval to the GridMate tick rate. The default is 0.
gm_replicasSendLimit
Limits the amount of replica data sent per second. 0 specifies no limit. The default is 0. This value is disabled in release builds.
gm_burstTimeLimit
Specifies, in seconds, an interval window during which bandwidth capping is not applied. If bandwidth usage continues to exceed the replica send limit outside of this interval, the sent amount is capped at the send limit. The default is 10. This variable is disabled in release builds.
gamelift_fleet_id
Specifies the GameLift FleetId to use for this client when starting GameLiftSessionService.
gamelift_aws_access_key
Specifies the AWS access key associated with the GameLift fleet.
gamelift_aws_secret_key
Specifies the AWS secret key associated with the GameLift fleet.
gamelift_aws_region
Specifies the AWS region associated with the GameLift fleet. The default is us-west-2.
gamelift_endpoint
Specifies the GameLift service endpoint. The default is gamelift.us-west-2.amazonaws.com.
gamelift_alias_id
Specifies the GameLift alias ID to use with the client.
gamelift_player_id
Specifies the GameLift player ID associated with the client.
gamelift_stop_client
Stops the GameLiftSessionService and terminates the current GridSession, if one is connected.
gamelift_queue_name
Specifies GameLift queue to use for this client when creating or joining a game session.
gamelift_matchmaking_config_name
Specifies GameLift FlexMatch matchmaking configuration to use for this client when being placed in a game session.
sv_port 
Sets the local UDP port that initializes the socket. The default port is 30090. To use the ephemeral port, set the port to 0. This is useful if you want to connect to a server on the same computer as the client.
Server CVars
gamelift_flexmatch_enable
Configures the server process to enable custom matchmaking backfill for FlexMatch.
gamelift_flexmatch_onplayerremoved_enable
Configures the server process to start matchmaking backfill on players removed and if an empty slot is available.
gamelift_flexmatch_minimumplayersessioncount
Configuration used to terminate game session if player count falls below the set amount.
gamelift_flexmatch_start_delay
Delay to add to start matchmaking backfill on new game session create.
