Slider
You can use the Slider component to make an element behave like a slider. This component is typically applied to an element with three visual child elements: one immediate child, called Track, and two child elements of the track, called Fill and Handle. 

To see in-game examples of completed canvases with the Slider component, open the level UiFeatures in the project SamplesProject. Press CtrlG to play the game, and then choose Components, Interactable Components, Slider. You can view examples of different slider behavior and positioning. Press Esc to exit the game.
To view these same canvases in the UI Editor, navigate to the \Gems\LyShineExamples\Assets\UI\Canvases\LyShineExamples\Comp\Slider directory. You can open the following canvases:
 Behavior.uicanvas – Examples of slider behaviors such as fill type, handles, and buttons to control the slider
 Rotation.uicanvas – Example of slider positioning
You can add a prebuilt Slider element from the slice library. When you do this, the slider's track, fill, and handle are automatically created in your Hierarchy pane.
To add a Slider element from the slice library
 In the UI Editor, choose New, Element from Slice Library, Slider.
