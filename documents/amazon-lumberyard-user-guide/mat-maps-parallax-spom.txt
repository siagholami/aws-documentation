Applying Silhouette Parallax Occlusion Mapping (SPOM)
To apply SPOM, complete the following procedure.
To apply Silhouette Parallax Occlusion Mapping


In Lumberyard Editor, click Tools, Material Editor.


In the left tree, select the desired asset.


In the right pane, under Shader Generation Params, select Parallax occlusion mapping with silhouette. 


Under Shader Params, adjust the values of the following parameters.


Height bias – Moves the plane where the displacement is applied. This reduces gaps in meshes, and prevents objects from displacing other objects that are placed above them.


Self shadow strength – Changes the strength of self-shadowing. A larger value imparts more shadowing


Silhouette POM Displacement – Sets the SPOM depth. A larger value adds more depth.


Under Texture Maps, enter the paths to the various textures.
