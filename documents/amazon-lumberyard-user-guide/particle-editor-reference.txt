Particles Attributes Reference

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
In the Particle Editor, you can modify how emitters and particles look and behave. You can find all available parameters in the Attributes pane. Except for a parameter's base value, most numeric parameters allow random variation over a particle or emitter lifetime.
Some parameters have additional settings:
 Random – Specifies how much a particle's parameter value deviates from the default value of 0 (no variation).
 Strength Over Emitter Life – Controls the alpha strength over the lifetime of the particle. This parameter works with finite particles only. This parameter has no effect if set to continuous.
 Strength Over Particle Life – Controls the alpha strength over the lifetime of an individual particle. For example, you can use this parameter to make a smoke particle fade to nothing once its lifetime has finished. The particle fades out earlier or later depending on where you reduce the value to zero.
