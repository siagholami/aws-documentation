Set Input Vector3
Sets the value of an input parameter as a Vector3. Use this node with the Float3 and Integer3 substance data types. 
If the input parameter is an integer type, the numbers that you specify are rounded down to the nearest integer value. For example, a value of 4.7 resolves to 4.
Note
You can use this node with all substance data types: Float1 through Float4 and Integer1 through Integer4. However, if the input parameter has fewer dimensions, the extra dimensions are ignored. If the input parameter has more dimensions, they are assigned a value of 0.
