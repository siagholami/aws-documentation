Level of Detail
Fur rendering level of detail uses many of the same mechanics as mesh level of detail. 
For fur rendering, the number of shell passes drawn decreases over a distance. You can define the maximum number of passes using the console variable r_FurShellPassCount.
The starting distance for beginning to decrease shell passes is mesh dependent. This distance is determined by the meshâ€™s parameters View distance multiplier and LOD distance ratio. You can find these parameters for the mesh or skinned mesh in the Entity Inspector's Options section. The ending distance, after which no fur shells are drawn, is determined by the console variable r_FurMaxViewDist.
