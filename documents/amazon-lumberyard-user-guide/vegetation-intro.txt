Vegetation Best Practices
Keep in mind the following best practices, recommendations, and guidelines when you add vegetation to your terrain level.
 Manually place vegetation to get the most control and best results.
 To save memory, place grass manually.
 Keep the polygon count for grass blades as low as possible.
 Do not exceed a diameter of 8 meters for grass patches. This size provides a balance between performance and coverage.
 Grasses and small plants do not require specular or opacity texture maps. For more information, see Working with Textures.
 Set the Opacity texture at a much lower resolution than the other maps.
 Use a Glossiness value of 8 or above for realistic results. 
 Use the automerged method to apply wind bending effects to grass.
 Use a maximum of 72 bones per tree for touch bending.
