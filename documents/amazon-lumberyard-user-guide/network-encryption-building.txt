Building with Encryption
When you include the GridMate library in your project, encryption support is automatically provided. However, because the GridMate library is statically linked, you must first make some modifications to the WAF build script (wscript) that uses GridMate. 
Building Your Project with Encryption
To use encryption with GridMate, you must modify your .wscript file to add a dependency on GridMate, link the OpenSSL library, and specify OpenSSL library paths.
To modify your .wscript file to use OpenSSL with GridMate

Add the following line to create a dependency on GridMate: 

use = ['GridMate']

Add the following line to link the OpenSSL library:

win_lib = ['ssleay32', 'libeay32']

Add the OpenSSL library paths, as in the following example. Within the Lumberyard install directory, these paths are in the folder dev\Code\SDKs\OpenSSL\lib\: 

win_x64_debug_libpath = [ bld.Path('Code/SDKs/OpenSSL/lib/vc120_x64_debug') ],
   win_x64_profile_libpath = [ bld.Path('Code/SDKs/OpenSSL/lib/vc120_x64_release') ],
   win_x64_release_libpath = [ bld.Path('Code/SDKs/OpenSSL/lib/vc120_x64_release') ],
   win_x64_debug_dedicated_libpath = [ bld.Path('Code/SDKs/OpenSSL/lib/vc120_x64_debug') ],
   win_x64_profile_dedicated_libpath = [ bld.Path('Code/SDKs/OpenSSL/lib/vc120_x64_release') ],
   win_x64_release_dedicated_libpath = [ bld.Path('Code/SDKs/OpenSSL/lib/vc120_x64_release') ]
Building Without Encryption
If your project uses GridMate, but does not require support for encryption, ensure that the GridMateForTools line is in your .wscript file: 
use = ['GridMateForTools']
