Blend Two Additive Node
The Blend Two Additive node blends a pose 2 input additively on top of a pose 1 input.

Note
This node functions similarly to the Blend Two (Legacy) node with Additive enabled. The key difference is that the Blend Two (Legacy) node subtracts the bind pose when applying an additive blend. Furthermore, Blend Two Additive expects pose 2 to be an additive pose. This means that if you wanted Blend Two Additive to function like the Blend Two (Legacy) node, you must first subtract the bind pose from pose 2.
To use the Blend Two Additive node


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, Animation Editor.


Create a blend tree.


Double-click the blend tree node that you created.


Select the Anim Graph Palette tab and then select the Blending tab.


Drag the Blend Two Additive node into the animation graph.






Connect nodes to the following inputs and output:
    Pose 1 – The base pose.
    Pose 2 – The pose to be added to Pose 1.
    Weight – Weight of additive.
 You can use a **Float Constant** node, for example, to specify a float value between `0.0` and `1.0`\. A value of `0.0` means **Pose 2** does not affect **Pose 1** at all\. A value of `1.0` means that **Pose 2** is fully added on top of **Pose 1**\. Other nodes that can specify **Weight** include the **Parameter** node, the **Smoothing** node, and so on\.


Output Pose – The result of the blended poses, which you can visualize as Pose 1  (Pose 2 * Weight).

Blend Two Additive Node Attributes
For attribute settings that are shared among the blend node types, see Blend Node Attributes.
The Extraction Mode for the Blend Two Additive node features masking and additive blending, which adds complexity over Extraction Mode for transitions.
The output from motion extraction with the Blend Two Additive node is calculated as follows.
 S = Source transform delta
 T = Target transform delta
Additive, root included in mask (or no mask provided):
 Blend = S  T * weight
 Source = S
 Target = T
Additive, root excluded from mask:
 Blend = S
 Source = S
 Target = S
