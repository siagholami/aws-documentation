Managing Particle Level of Detail (LOD)
The Level of Detail (LOD) system blends multiple particle emitters based on their distance from the camera. This allows you to use emitters that require less computation and rendering time, rather than computationally heavy particle emitters.
To add an LOD for a particle emitter


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, Particle Editor.


In the Particle Editor, in the Libraries panel, right-click an emitter.


Select Add LOD.


The LOD is a copy of the base particle emitter and has the same settings. The LOD also applies to all parent or child particle emitters in the hierarchy that belong to the selected emitter.

Level of Detail Panel
The Level of Detail panel appears when you add an LOD. This panel shows the level of detail that you selected from the View menu in the Particle Editor.





Option
Description




Blend In
The amount of time, in seconds, for an LOD to blend in.


Blend Out
The amount of time, in seconds, for an LOD to blend out.


Overlap
The amount of time, in seconds, that both LODs are shown before the old LOD blends out and the new LOD blends in.


 Add Level of Detail
Adds an LOD. The new LOD distance is set to 10 additional units from the farthest LOD. The list of added LOD levels appears under  Add Level of Detail.



Hide or Display Options
Hide or display the Level of Detail panel by clicking View, Hide Level of Detail in the Particle Editor.





Option
Description




Hide Level of Detail
Hides the LOD panel if the panel is visible.


Show Level of Detail
Displays the LOD panel if the panel is hidden.



Manage LOD Options
Manage your LOD levels in the list by clicking the drop-down menu in the Level of Detail title bar.





Option
Description




Add level
Adds an LOD level to the end of the list.


Arrange
Shows the Arrange submenu: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Jump to first
Selects the first LOD level in the list. This also selects the top particle emitter in the list and loads it in the Attributes panel.


Jump to last
Selects the last LOD level in the list. This also selects the top particle emitter in the list and loads it in the Attributes panel.


Remove
Removes the selected LOD level.


Remove All
Removes all LOD levels for the related particle emitters.


Close
Closes the Level of Detail panel.



LOD Level Panel
Each LOD level has its own panel in the LOD level list. These panels show all relevant information for each individual level.
Note
The base particle emitter is shown if the camera distance is lower than the top LOD level. This makes the base particle the starting LOD level. 





Option
Description




Top left check box
Turns on/off the entire level.


LOD distance value
Specifies the camera distance at which the LOD level becomes active. At this level, the particle emitter blends toward the LOD level and blends out the previous LOD level.


Top right button
Deletes the corresponding LOD level.


Particle check box
Turns off the particle emitter at this level. When the emitter is off, nothing is drawn. You can use this to turn off particle emitters based on the LOD level.


Particle name
Click a particle name to load the LOD level particle emitter for the selected particle emitter in the Attributes panel. You can use this to change the LOD level particle emitter. Right-click a particle name and click Remove to remove the particle from the LOD level. Any child particle emitters are also removed from the LOD level.
