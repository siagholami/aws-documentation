Building Game Assets for macOS Games

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
When you build a macOS game using Lumberyard, you must first build the assets that are included with the application. All built assets are located in the cache folder of your Lumberyard installation. For example, when you build the Samples Project, the assets are saved to the lumberyard_version\dev\cache\SamplesProject\osx_gl directory. The initial build of the Samples Project assets may take up to an hour to process, but incremental changes should process almost instantly.
Note
If you make changes to your game in Lumberyard Editor on your PC, you must copy the updated assets to your Mac using your preferred method. For example, you can use source control. For information, see Using the Perforce Plugin with Lumberyard.
To build macOS game assets on your Mac


On your Mac, close all instances of the Asset Processor.


Edit the bootstrap.cfg file (located in the lumberyard_version/dev directory) to set sys_game_folder to SamplesProject (or the project you want to build). Save the file.


Edit the AssetProcessorPlatformConfig.ini file (located in the lumberyard_version/dev directory) to uncomment osx_gl=enabled (remove the preceding semicolon) and to comment out pc=enabled (add a preceding semicolon). Save the file.


In a command line window, navigate to the lumberyard_version/dev/BinMac64 directory and run Asset Processor (GUI or batch version) to process and build your game assets.
