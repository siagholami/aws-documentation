UI Canvas Proxy Ref
With the UI Canvas Proxy Ref component, you can associate a component entity in a level with another component entity that is managing a UI canvas. Use this component in conjunction with the UI Canvas on Mesh component if you want to place a UI canvas on a 3D mesh that a player can interact with in several places in the 3D world.
Use of this component is often a special case, as it supports displaying the same UI canvas on multiple entities in the 3D world. The UI Canvas Proxy Ref component allows the component entity that it is on it to act as if it had a UI Canvas Asset Ref component but without having to load another copy of the UI canvas. This means that, as the user interacts with one UI canvas on a 3D object, the other 3D object shows the same changes.
To see an example of using the UI Canvas Proxy Ref component, open the UiIn3DWorld level in the Samples Project.
The following picture shows three entities that share the same loaded canvas. The curved plane entity has a UI Canvas Asset Ref component and the egg and the sphere both have UI Canvas Proxy Ref components:
