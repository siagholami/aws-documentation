UISpawner Component
Use the UISpawner component to spawn a runtime dynamic slice (*.dynamicslice) at an entity's location with an optional offset. In combination with scripting, you can use the UISpawner component to spawn any dynamic slice at any time and to spawn multiple instances of the same dynamic slice.

Example UISpawner Component
You can view a canvas with the UISpawner component in Samples Project. For more information, see Samples Project.
To view an example canvas with a UISpawner component


For Samples Project, choose File, Open, UI, UiFeatures.


To start the game, press CtrlG.


Choose Components, Dynamic Components, Spawner. You can see an example of a simple button spawner and a more complex radio button spawner.


To exit the game, press Esc.


You can also view the example canvases in the UI Editor.
To view the canvases


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, UI Editor.


Navigate to the lumberyard_version\dev\Gems\LyShineExamples\Assets\UI\Canvases\LyShineExamples\Comp\Spawner directory.


Select a file and click Open.

*Spawn on Activate*
If selected, spawns the selected slice upon activation.
EBus Request Bus Interface
Use the following request functions with the UiSpawnerBus EBus interface to communicate with other components of your game.
For more information about using the event bus (EBus) interface, see Working with the Event Bus (EBus) system.
Spawn
Spawns the UI slice specified in the component at the entity's location.
Parameters
None
Return
The slice instantiation ticket for this spawn.
Scriptable
Yes
SpawnRelative
Spawns the UI slice specified in the component at the entity's location with the specified relative offset.
Parameters
Relative – The offset position from the entity with the spawner component.
Return
The slice instantiation ticket for this spawn.
Scriptable
Yes
SpawnViewport
Spawns the slice specified in the component at the specified viewport position.
Parameters
Pos – The viewport position at which to spawn the slice.
Return
The slice instantiation ticket for this spawn.
Scriptable
Yes
SpawnSlice
Spawns the specified slice at the entity's location.
Parameters
slice – Specifies the slice asset to be spawned.
Return
The slice instantiation ticket for this spawn.
Scriptable
No
SpawnSliceRelative
Spawns the given slice at the entity's location with the relative offset.
Parameters
slice – Specifies the slice asset to be spawned.
relative – The offset position from the entity with the spawner component.
Return
The slice instantiation ticket for this spawn.
Scriptable
No
SpawnSliceViewport
Spawns the specified slice at the specified viewport position.
Parameters
slice – Specifies the slice asset to be spawned.
pos – The viewport position at which to spawn the slice.
Return
The slice instantiation ticket for this spawn.
Scriptable
Yes
EBus Notification Bus Interface
Use the following notification functions with the UiSpawnerNotificationBus EBus interface to communicate with other components of your game.
For more information about using the event bus (EBus) interface, see Working with the Event Bus (EBus) system.
OnSpawnBegin
Announces that the slice has been spawned, but entities have not yet been activated. OnEntitySpawned events are about to be dispatched.
Parameters
ticket – The slice instantiation ticket that is returned by the spawn function. These can be compared in order to know which spawn request it relates to.
Scriptable
Yes
OnSpawnEnd
Announces that a slice has been spawned. This function is called once for each spawn request. All OnEntitySpawned events have been dispatched. 
Parameters
ticket – The slice instantiation ticket that is returned by the spawn function. These can be compared in order to know which spawn request it relates to.
Scriptable
Yes
OnEntitySpawned
Announces that an entity has been created during a spawn. This function is called once for each entity created while spawning a slice.
Parameters
ticket – The slice instantiation ticket that is returned by the spawn function. These can be compared in order to know which spawn request it relates to.
spawnedEntity – Specifies the ID of the spawned entity.
Scriptable
Yes
OnEntitiesSpawned
Provides the list of all entities that were created during a spawn. This function is called only once for each spawn request. The function is called after the OnEntitySpawned calls and before the OnSpawnEnd call. 
Parameters
ticket – The slice instantiation ticket that is returned by the spawn function. These can be compared in order to know which spawn request it relates to.
spawnedEntities – Specifies the IDs of the spawned entities.
Scriptable
Yes
OnTopLevelEntitiesSpawned
Provides the list of all top-level entities that were created during a spawn. This function is called only once for each spawn request. The function is called after the OnEntitySpawned calls and before the OnSpawnEnd call.
Top-level entities are entities that do not have any parent within the slice. Typically, there is only one top-level entity for each slice.
Parameters
ticket – The slice instantiation ticket returned by the spawn function. These can be compared in order to know which spawn request it relates to.
spawnedEntities – Specifies the IDs of the spawned top-level entities.
Scriptable
Yes
OnSpawnFailed
Announces that a spawn request has failed.
Parameters
ticket – The slice instantiation ticket that is returned by the spawn function. These can be compared in order to know which spawn request it relates to.
Scriptable
Yes
