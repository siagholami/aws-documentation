Inspect Your Resources in AWS
This topic shows you how to sign in to the AWS Management Console and use the console to inspect the AWS CloudFormation stacks that you created.
To sign in to the AWS Management Console as your IAM user


Retrieve the AWS account ID that you received when you created your AWS account. To sign in as your CloudCanvasAdmin IAM user, use this AWS account ID.


In a web browser, enter the following URL with your account ID:


https://My_AWS_Account_ID.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
For example, if your AWS account ID is *1234\-5678\-9012*, you sign in at `https://123456789012.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/`\.

For convenience, you can create a bookmark of your URL for future use.
Tip
To create a bookmark for your account sign-in page in your web browser, you should manually type the sign-in URL for your account in the bookmark entry. Do not use your web browser bookmark feature because redirects can obscure the sign-in URL. 


Enter the CloudCanvasAdmin IAM user name that you created.


Enter the password for the user and choose Sign In.


You are now successfully signed into the AWS Management Console. 
To inspect your resources in AWS


Ensure that the AWS region, which appears on the upper-right of the console screen, is set to the region that you specified when you had Cloud Canvas deploy its resources in Step 5 of the tutorial. This tutorial uses the US East (N. Virginia) Region.


Do one of the following:
    In the AWS services search box, enter CloudFormation, and then click CloudFormation.
    Expand All services and under Management Tools, click CloudFormation.


On the Stacks page, you can see the individual stacks that have been created for your cloud gems and for your deployment.

Note
If a stack update operation is still in progress, the stack shows the status UPDATE-IN-PROGRESS. Otherwise, the status shows CREATE-COMPLETE. You can click the Refresh icon  to update the status.
