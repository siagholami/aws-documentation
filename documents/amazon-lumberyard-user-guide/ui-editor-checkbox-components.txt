Checkbox
You can use the Checkbox component to make an element behave like a check box. This component is typically applied to an element with two visual child elements: One element appears when the check box is selected and another appears when the check box is cleared.

To see in-game examples of completed canvases with the Checkbox component, open the level UiFeatures in the project SamplesProject. Press CtrlG to play the game, and then choose Components, Interactable Components, CheckBox. You can view examples of color targets, check box interaction areas, and on and off elements. Press Esc to exit the game.
To view these same canvases in the UI Editor, navigate to the \Gems\LyShineExamples\Assets\UI\Canvases\LyShineExamples\Comp\CheckBox directory. You can open the following canvases:
 Area.uicanvas – Examples of different check box interaction areas
 ColorTargets.uicanvas – Examples of different color targets when interacting with the check box
 OnOff.uicanvas – Examples of different check box on and off elements
You can add a prebuilt Checkbox element from the slice library. When you do this, a basic check box with the text string "Checkbox" and a check image for the box is automatically created in your Hierarchy pane.
To add a Checkbox element from the slice library
 In the UI Editor, choose New, Element from Slice Library, Checkbox.
