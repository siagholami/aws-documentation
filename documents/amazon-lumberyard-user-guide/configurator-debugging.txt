Troubleshooting

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change. 
Review the following if you experience issues when using the Project Configurator.
Perforce integration
If you have enabled Perforce integration with the tooling, then the Project Configurator automatically checks the following files out of Perforce. If not, then update the read only flag manually:
 project_asset_folder\gems.json
 project_asset_folder\game.cfg
 lumberyard_version\bootstrap.cfg
 lumberyard_version\dev\game_project_folder\project.json
Cannot create a new project
Make sure that the lumberyard_version\dev\game_project_folder\project.json file is editable.
Ensure that the name entered is valid and does not contain special characters or whitespaces.
Cannot enable or disable a gem
Make sure that the project_asset_folder\gems.json file is editable before trying to save changes made to gems being enabled or disabled.
New project or gem does not appear in Visual Studio
Make sure that you have run lmbr_waf configure from a command line, which regenerates the Visual Studio solution to include the new project or gem.
If the project or gem still does not show up in Visual Studio, ensure that the enabled_game_projects field in the lumberyard_version\dev\_WAF_\user_settings.options file is set to the name of your project.
Wrong project gets loaded in Lumberyard Editor
Ensure that the lumberyard_version\dev\bootstrap.cfg is editable. Then, open the Project Configurator, select the project to open, and choose Set as default.

Also ensure that the sys_game_folder field in the lumberyard_version\dev\bootstrap.cfg file is set to the name of your project.
