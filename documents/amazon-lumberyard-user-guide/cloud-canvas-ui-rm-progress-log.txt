Viewing the Cloud Canvas Progress Log
The Cloud Canvas Resource Manager Progress log shows the progress of AWS CloudFormation stack updates. During the update, the progress log expands from the bottom of the detail pane to display the progress of the update. You can adjust the amount of space the log uses by dragging the divider line between the panes. 

To hide the progress log, drag the divider downward.
