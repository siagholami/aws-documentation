Editing Bots

This feature is in preview release and is subject to change.
You can edit speech-recognition bots in the Cloud Gem Portal.
To edit a bot


Open the Cloud Gem Portal by doing one of the following:
    In Lumberyard Editor, click AWS, Open Cloud Gem Portal.
    If you have been given a shareable link to the Cloud Gem Portal (for example, by another team member), open the link in a browser. Lumberyard does not have to be installed on your computer.


Enter your user name and password at the sign-in page.


On the Cloud Gems page, click Speech Recogntion.


Click the bot's entry on the Bots tab to open the Editor tab.



Note
 Only the latest version of a bot can be edited. 


Sample utterances – Click Add to create one or more spoken or typed phrases that invoke your intent. Use curly braces {} to insert slot names in the phrase. For example, "I want to order a {size} pizza."


Lambda initialization and validation – Use this option to specify a Lambda function that validates input.


Expand the Lambda initialization and validation option.


Select Initialization and validation code hook.


In the Lambda function ARN box, enter the ARN of the Lambda function that you want to perform the validation.


Slots – Slots are data that the player must provide so that the player's intent can be fulfilled. Use this option to add a slot or modify slots.


For Name, enter a name for the slot.


For Slot type and version, choose a slot type and version from the list. You can create new slot types on the Slot Types tab of the Speech Recognition page.


For Prompt, enter the text of a question that elicits the information for the slot. A slot can have multiple prompts. 


Confirmation prompt – (Optional) Specify confirmation and cancellation messages. After creation, click each gear icon to configure these settings. 
Note
 You must specify both the confirmation and cancellation messages, or neither. You cannot specify one without the other. 


Adding an Intent
You can use the navigation pane on the left to add an intent to the current bot.
To add an intent to the current bot


Click Add in the navigation pane. 



In the Add Intent window, create an intent or select an existing custom intent or built-in intent. 



Enter a new name for the intent. You must provide a new name for built-in intents.



Note
When you use a bot's Editor tab to create an intent, the intent is added to the bot automatically. When you use the Speech Recognition Intents tab to create an intent, the intent must be added to manually to the bots that you want to use it.
Choosing an Intent Version
You can configure a bot to use any version of an intent. Use the menu for the intent to choose a version.

Note
 Only the latest version of an intent can be edited.
You can also create and manage intents on the Intents tab.
Removing an Intent
To detach (remove) an intent from the bot, pause your pointer on the intent name and click the remove (X) icon.

Note
If you are unable to detach intents from a bot and are using the Firefox browser, you can use the Editor tab for the bot on the Amazon Lex console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/. 
To delete an intent completely, use the Intents tab of the Cloud Gem Portal. You must detach an intent from all bots before the intent can be deleted.
Editing Slot Types
You can use the bot Editor tab to edit the slot types for the intents that have slot types.
To edit a slot type


In the left navigate pane, click an intent that has a slot type. When the intent name is selected, the intent's corresponding slot types appear under Slot types.



In the navigation pane, under Slot types, click the name of the slot that you want to edit. The description and values for the slot appear in the details pane.



Change the slot description and add, edit, or delete values for the slot. You can only edit the latest version of the slot type.


To view all the prompts for a slot type, click the gear icon in the Prompt column. 



The following image shows sample prompts for the MapLocation slot type.

Error Handling
Choose Error handling from the left navigation pane to add clarification prompts, specify the number of times to retry questions, or specify a hang-up phrase. 

Bot Settings
You can manage aliases and general information for a bot on the Settings tab to the right of the Editor tab. 
Note
The Settings tab for general information and aliases is available when the Editor tab is active. The Settings tab that contains a link to the Amazon Lex console is available when the main Speech Recognition page is active. 
Aliases
Use the Aliases details pane to view and manage your bot aliases. As mentioned, an alias is a pointer to a specific version of a bot. You specify an alias when you publish a bot. You can use aliases to simplify updating the version of the bot that your client applications use.

General Information
Use the General details pane to edit additional settings for your bot. These include your bot's description, its session timeout, and whether the bot is subject to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). For more information about COPPA and Amazon Lex, see the Data and Security section of the Amazon Lex FAQ.
