Organizing Nodes
Script Canvas graphs can easily grow in size and complexity and become too big to fit on one screen and still be legible. This presents a challenge to find sections of interest and keep things organized. And when you or others revisit the graph later, it can be difficult to quickly remember or pick up on the logic. To help manage this organizational challenge, the Script Canvas editor provides a handful of tools at your disposal. In the following topics, you will learn how to arrange, comment, and bookmark sections of your graph, and discover productivity-enhancing techniques for quickly selecting multiple nodes and navigating around your graphs.
