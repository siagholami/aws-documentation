Animating the UI
You can animate your game's UI using one of the following tools:
Scripted Entity Tweener System
Installed as a gem, this system uses custom Lua scripts to create powerful and flexible animations.
UI Animation Editor
Embedded as a GUI in the UI Editor, this tool can create complex animations. You activate your animation sequences by using Script Canvas, with the UiAnimationBus eBus, or through C scripting.
