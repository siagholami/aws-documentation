Setting up a Lobby
By default, the Lumberyard engine does not provide any specific lobby implementation, but instead provides the code interface required to construct one. The Multiplayer Gem does, however, provide some useful constructs that aid in lobby creation using a basic lobby implementation using components, that can be used as is, or as a reference.
For more information, see the Multiplayer Gem.
