Configuring Image Processing
Images or textures are automatically processed by Asset Processor, which makes them ready for Lumberyard game creation. When you place an image file anywhere within your Lumberyard directory, Asset Processor detects and converts the file to a game-ready asset. Lumberyard has several configuration files that specify settings for the conversion process, such as the colorspace to use, texture size, whether to generate mip maps, and so on. 
You can edit the configuration files to create your own image processing presets. To use these presets, you append existing or customized suffixes to your image file names. Based on these file name suffixes, Asset Processor automatically uses the appropriate preset to convert the image.
After Asset Processor successfully converts the image, the resulting .dds asset is placed in the appropriate lumberyard_version\dev\Cache directory. The image source file remains in its original form and location.
Asset Processor calls the Resource Compiler, rc.exe (located in lumberyard_version\dev\Bin64vc141\rc), to convert the image files. Resource Compiler also has an image tool, which you can use to manually select image presets, mip maps, and so on. The Resource Compiler image tool can also output an imagefilename.exportsettings, which you must check in if your project uses source control such as Perforce. Checking in the .exportsettings file ensures that the texture renders similarly for each person working on the project.
Lumberyard supports the following image file types:
 TIFF – No grayscale
 TGA – Indexed or true color only; no grayscale
 PNG – RGB or RGBA only; no grayscale
 BMP – Any format
 GIF – Supported, but not an ideal texture format
 JPG – Any format
The following diagram represents the general workflow for converting images.
