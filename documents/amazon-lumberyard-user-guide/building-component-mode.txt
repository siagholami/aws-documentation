Step 6: Building Component Mode
In the following procedure, you must build the editor so that you can view your changes in Lumberyard Editor.
To build Component Mode


Navigate to the lumberyard_version\dev\Gems\LmbrCentral\Code directory.


In a text editor, open the lmbrcentral_editor.waf_files.waf file.


Navigate to the "Source/Rendering": section and add the files that you created for a Component Mode.
Example 


"Source/Rendering/EditorPointLightComponent.h",
   "Source/Rendering/EditorPointLightComponent.cpp",
   "Source/Rendering/EditorPointLightComponentMode.h",
   "Source/Rendering/EditorPointLightComponentMode.cpp",


Save the file.


Navigate to the lumberyard_version/dev directory.


In a command-line window, enter the following commands to build the editor.


lmbr_waf configure
lmbr_waf build_win_x64_vs2017_profile -p all


After your build succeeds, open Lumberyard Editor and choose or create a level.


In the viewport, create an entity, attach the Point Light component, and do one of the following:
    Double-click the entity
    In the Entity Inspector, choose Edit



Make changes to your component in the viewport. You can select the manipulator on the Point Light component to adjust the radius of the light area.


When you've finished, choose Done.
