Working with Database Libraries

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
With Lumberyard's Database View editor, you can organize and work within the libraries of your game items. You can add new or load existing libraries to your level, or remove libraries from your level. Within a library, you can organize items by customized groups, clone and edit items, assign items to selected objects, and retrieve properties from the current selection.
The Database View editor displays the following categories of libraries on its tabs:
 Entity Library
 Prefabs Library
 Vegetation
 Particles
 GameTokens
Using the Database View editor's toolbar, you can load, save, or add new libraries, or remove a library. The drop-down menu features a list of libraries that you've already opened; select an open library from this list. Use the Add new item tool (1) to add items to your library, Clone library item (2) to create a duplicate of an existing item, and Remove item (3) to delete the item from the library. Use Assign item to selected objects (4) to assign the selected item to objects currently selected in your viewport. Use Get properties from selection (5) to use the properties of the object selected in the viewport and apply those properties to the item selected in the item browser.
The item browser pane (A) shows the groups and items that are available in the current library. The properties pane (B) displays the properties of the item selected in the item browser. Some tabs also feature a preview pane (C).
