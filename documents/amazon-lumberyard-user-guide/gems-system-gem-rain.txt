Rain Gem

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
The Rain Gem creates realistic rain effects in your levels, including rain drops, puddles, mist, wet surfaces, and splashes. To enable the Rain Gem in your project, see Add modular features and assets with Gems.
This gem is a game object extension. On initialization, it preloads all textures listed in the raintextures.xml file.

Note
Place only a single Rain entity in your scene.
Placing Rain
You can place rain and customize it for your level by modifying properties for amount of puddles, strength and frequence of puddle ripples, quantity of rain, size and speed of the rain drops, and more.
To add rain to your level


In the Rollup Bar, click Entity.


Under Browser, expand Environment.


Drag the Rain entity into your scene.


Configuring Rain
You can configure the rain's properties under https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/entities-params-entity-params.html and Entity Properties.

Using the Rain Sample
The Rain Sample uses the Rain, Clouds, and LightningArc gems to demonstrate how to use rain as an environment special effects (FX) in a level. The Lightning entity (from the LightningArc gem) shows how the lightning FX can enhance a rain storm with flashes of light and random strikes of lightning on the ground. The clouds are enabled to show how they can fill a scene.
