Sphere Emitter (CPU and GPU)
The Sphere emitter enables spawning of particles along the shapes axial coordinate system (see diagram below). This allows you to create complex spherical effects.
The following is an example of the Sphere emitter in the Preview viewport.

The following are parameters for the Sphere emitter.

Sphere Emitter Parameters 



Parameter
Description




Emitter Size
Sets the size of the sphere emitter in meters. Valid values: 0 (radius)Default value: 5


Spawn Pos XYZ
XYZ values define the spawning position away from the emitter itself in emitter space. You can set a Random value and Strength over Emitter Lifetime curve. Valid values: any Default value: 0, 0, 0


Spawn Pos XYZ Random
For additional random layering, XYZ values define the range of random spawning in both directions, away from the spawn position. You can set a Random value and Strength over Emitter Lifetime curve. Valid values: anyDefault value: 0, 0, 0


Spawn Pos Increment XYZ
Spawns each subsequent particle at incremental positions along the axis over the emitter size, based on a percentage value. For example, if you set a value of 20, a particle spawns every 20% along the axis, making 5 particles on the axis to equal 100%. You can set a Random value and Strength over Emitter Lifetime curve. Valid values: any (percentage)Default value: 0


Spawn Pos Increment XYZ Random
Provides another layer of randomization for each particle to spawn at percentages over the axis, independent of the Spawn Pos Increment parameter. You can set a Random value and Strength Over Emitter Lifetime curve. Valid values: any (percentage)Default value: 0


Velocity XYZ
XYZ values define the velocity applied to particles in world space. The velocity direction also sets the axis around which velocity spread occurs. You can set a Random value and Strength over Emitter Lifetime curve. Valid values: anyDefault values: 0, 0, 0


Velocity XYZ Random
For additional random layering, XYZ values define the random velocity applied to particles in world space. You can set a Random value and Strength over Emitter Lifetime curve. Valid values: anyDefault value: 0, 0, 0
