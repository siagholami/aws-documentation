Specifying a Blend Curve for Smooth Effect Transitions
You can use BlendIn and BlendOut tags to specify a blend curve that enables smooth transitions between effects.
An example XML file with added BlendIn and BlendOut tags:
<PostEffectGroup priority="1" hold="1">
    <Effect name="SunShafts">
        <Param name="RaysAmount" floatValue="0.2"/>
    </Effect>
    <BlendIn curve="smooth">
        <Key time="0" value="0"/>
        <Key time="0.5" value="1"/>
    </BlendIn>
    <BlendOut curve="smooth">
        <Key time="0" value="1"/>
        <Key time="0.5" value="0"/>
    </BlendOut>
</PostEffectGroup>
Priority
Indicates how much the effects should override the lower priority values.
Hold
Determines when the BlendIn and BlendOut curves play and whether the effect group is enabled or disabled.
Valid values: 
0 = Plays the BlendOut curve immediately after the BlendIn curve finishes playing; when the BlendOut curve plays, the effect group is disabled
1 = Plays the BlendIn curve; when the BlendIn curve plays, the effect group fully overrides lower priority values until the effect group is explicitly disabled
Curve
Available curve types are smooth, linear, and step. If a curve attribute value is not specified, the curve type defaults to smooth. You can include as many keyframes in a curve as desired.
Default curve value: smooth
Valid key time values: smooth, linear, step
Key time
Valid values: 0 â€“ 1 (seconds)
