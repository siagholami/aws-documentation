Using Parameters to Adjust the Animation During Runtime
You can adjust the SimulatedObject node to change its animation during runtime. To do so, create a Parameter node and attach them to the node in the anim graph. If you don't, the SimulatedObject node uses the properties that you entered in the Attributes panel.
To adjust the animation during runtime


In the Parameters panel, click the  icon and choose Add parameter.


Enter the following values.


For Value type, select the Float (slider).


For Name, enter Stiffness.


For Default, enter 1.0.


For Minimum to 1.0.


For Maximum, enter 100.
Example 


Your parameter should look like the following.



Click Create.


Repeat Steps 2 and 3 but change Name to Gravity, Default to 1.0, Minimum to 0 and Maximum to 5.


Repeat Steps 2 and 3 but change Name to Damping, Default to 1.0, Minimum to 1 and Maximum to 100.


Repeat Steps 2 and 3 but change Name to Weight, Default to 1, Minimum to 0 and Maximum to 1.
Example 


Your parameters should look like the following.



In the Anim Graph grid, right-click and choose Create Node, Sources, Parameters.


On the Parameters0 node, connect the Stiffness output to the Stiffness factor, the Gravity output to the Gravity factor, and so on.
Example 


Your graph should look like the following.


Pay the anim graph and adjust the sliders for the Parameters to view your changes.

Note
The simulated object, simulated joints, and parameters on the anim graph share the following properties: Stiffness, Gravity, Damping
When you adjust the properties, the Animation Editor calculates the results of these properties using the following:
Stiffness factor parameter X simulated object stiffness X simulated joint stiffness
Gravity factor parameter X simulated object gravity X simulated joint gravity
Damping factor parameter X simulated object damping X simulated joint damping
