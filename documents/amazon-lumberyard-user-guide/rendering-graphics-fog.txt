Standard Fog
Lumberyard's standard fog system handles sunlight with dynamic shadows and exponential height fog density. However, in dense fog situations the fog's appearance may not be consistent between opaque and transparent materials.
You can add the Fog Volume component to an entity to create fog effects. For more information, see the Fog Volume component.
