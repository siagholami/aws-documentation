Trail Emitter (CPU)
The Trail emitter connects particles together to create a trailing effect as the system moves through space.
The following are parameters for the Trail emitter.

Trail Emitter Parameters 



Parameter Function
Description




Connect to Origin
Connects a newly spawned particle to the origin. Default value: false


Texture Mirror
Mirrors alternating texture tiles. Default value: true


Texture Frequency
Specifies the number of texture wraps per trail emitter sequence, based on the Texture Mapping type. Valid values: 0Default value: 1


Lock Anchor Points
Locks the UV anchor points of the texture to stay in place, rather than follow the emitter location. Default value: false


Texture Mapping
Maps the assigned texture to each particle quad or across the trail stream. [See the AWS documentation website for more details] Default value: Per Particle



Note
When there is a single light source, some or all particles for Trail emitters can appear unlit (black). This is most apparent when the sun is the only light source and the time and day setting is noon. To address this:
Add an Environment Probe to the scene to create indirect lighting. For more information, see Environment Probe.
Enable Environment Probe Lighting on the particle system by specifying a value for the Environment Probe Lighting parameter. For example, a value of 0.5 applies light from the Environment Probe at half intensity. For more information, see Lighting Attribute.
Particle Trail Visibility
Trail segments are drawn when the distance between the start and end of a segment exceed the value for Min visible distance. You can choose to automatically disable the drawing of trails that are not moving or are moving too slowly. This is useful if you have particle trail effects that need to be drawn only when the emitter is moving.
The following are movement parameters for the Trail emitter.

Parameter
Description




Min visible segment length
(Trail Emitter (CPU) only) Tail particles are visible only when they have moved the specified distance. Default value: false


Min visible distance
(Trail Emitter (CPU) only) Specifies the minimum distance between the start and end of a trail segment. Segments that are smaller than this value become transparent. Valid values: 0Default value: 0
