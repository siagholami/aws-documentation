Using Amazon GameLift
Lumberyard supports hosting dedicated servers on the cloud by using Amazon GameLift. Amazon GameLift is a managed AWS service for deploying, operating, and scaling session-based multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift is built on AWS’s highly available cloud infrastructure and allows you to quickly scale high-performance game servers up and down to meet player demand – without any additional engineering effort or upfront costs. It reduces the time required to build a multiplayer backend from thousands of hours to just minutes.
To use GameLift in your project, there are two options:
 Enable the GameLift Gem in your project. Lumberyard has integrated Amazon GameLift, which makes it easier for you to use GameLift.
 Enable the Lumberyard Multiplayer Gem in your project (which requires the GameLift Gem).
For information about configuring GameLift for the multiplayer sample, see Configuring the Multiplayer Sample for Amazon GameLift. For information, see Add modular features and assets with Gems. For more information about GameLift, see Amazon GameLift.
