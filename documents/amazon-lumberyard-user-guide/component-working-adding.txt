Adding Components to an Entity
After you create an entity, you can add components to it. 
To add a component to an entity


In the Entity Inspector, click Add Component or right-click and choose Add Component.


Components are grouped by category, such as Animation, Camera, and Gameplay. To find a specific component quickly, enter the name into the search bar at the top of the component list. 
Note
You can pause on the component name to see a description of that component. 


Select the component. 


Specify your settings for the component.


If you add a component that requires another component to function, the Entity Inspector displays the following message.



For example, the Ragdoll component also requires the Skinned Mesh component. Click Add Required Component and select the required component.
Note
Components must have the required dependencies to appear in game mode. The Entity Inspector displays a warning message for the following scenarios:
Incompatibilities exist between components
A component is missing a required component
A component is a duplicate
You must resolve the issue before you can use the component for the entity. Otherwise, the component is disabled.
