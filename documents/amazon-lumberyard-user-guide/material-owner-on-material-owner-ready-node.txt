On Ready
This node is triggered when the material owner finishes loading its assets. We recommend that you use this event to trigger functions for the Get Param* and Set Param* nodes (for example, the Get Param Color and Set Param Color nodes). Otherwise, the material asset might not be available when the script is first activated. For example, a Mesh component does not load its mesh until at least one frame after the script starts.
