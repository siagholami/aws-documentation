Rotation Attribute
In the Rotation attribute, specify how to control the particle's rotation.

Rotation Attribute Parameters 



Name
Description




Init Angles
XYZ values define the initial angle, in degrees, that is applied to the particles upon spawning. For Facing = Camera particles, only the y-axis is used and refers to rotation in screen space. For 3D particles, all three axes are used and refer to emitter local space. Valid values: anyDefault value: 0


Random Angles
XYZ values define the random variation (bidirectional), in degrees, to Init Angles. Valid values: 0Default value: 0


Rotation Rate X, Y, Z
Specifies the constant particle rotation in degrees/second. The axes are the same as Init Angles. You can set a Random value and Strength Over Emitter Lifetime and Strength Over Particle Lifetime curves. Valid values: anyDefault value: 0
