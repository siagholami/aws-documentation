Testing Your Gem
After you move your assets into the gem's directory structure, you can enable your new gem in your game project and test it in Lumberyard.
To enable and test your new gem


Open the Project Configurator by doing one of the following:
    Open Lumberyard Setup Assistant and on the Summary page, click Configure project.
    Open the Lumberyard Project Configurator directly from lumberyard-version\dev\Bin64BuildPlatform\ProjectConfigurator.exe. For example, when using Visual Studio 2017 as your build platform, the Project Configurator is located at lumberyard-version\dev\Bin64vc141\ProjectConfigurator.exe.


Enable your new gem.


Close the Project Configurator.


Launch Lumberyard and open a level.


Use the Asset Browser to place the gem's assets into your scene. Verify that your assets look as intended. If they don't, verify that you have set up the directories correctly.
