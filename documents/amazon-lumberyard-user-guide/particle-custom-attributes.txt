Creating Custom Attribute Panels
Create a custom particle attribute panel so you can quickly access the parameters that you frequently use. You can drag parameters from an existing standard panel to copy the parameters into the custom panel. Or you can drag parameters from a custom panel to move the parameters to the new custom panel. If you want to simultaneously add multiple parameters, press Ctrl while selecting the parameters.
When you move a panel to a new location, an indicator appears so you can preview a valid drop location. If you do not see an indicator, the parameter is inserted at the end of the panel. The following example shows a custom panel with drop indicators. 

To create a custom attribute panel


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, Particle Editor.


In the Particle Editor, click the menu in the Attributes title bar.


Do one of the following:

Name your custom attribute or browse to the attribute that you want to import.


Once created, you can right-click the attribute title bar to rename, empty, or export custom attribute panels.
