PAK Files
PAK files are zip files. You can inspect them with tools like 7Zip or WinRAR. Your Lumberyard apps use PAK files for assets and shaders in any build but are required for a release APK. While the build system generates the PAK files for you, you can also manually do this step.

Packing Shaders
The Lumberyard build system takes care of packing shaders for your app. The following is an overview of what happens in the backend in case developers want to make changes. 
Before shaders can be packed into your APK, the Remote Shader Compiler must generate them so the build tools can extract them. 
To pack shaders

Run your application in profile, or debug mode, and ensure that you view every surface on every level. Lumberyard supports both OpenGL ES 3.0 and OpenGL ES 3.1 and generates shaders on the latest version that a given device can support. 

If you run your game on two devices, one device can support only OpenGL ES 3.0 and the other can support OpenGL ES 3.1.

After the run completes, and your devices are still connected, enter the following from the command line in your lumberyard_version/dev directory. 
Example PC 

BuildShaderPak_ES3.bat SamplesProject
Example macOS 
sh BuildShaderPak_ES3.sh SamplesProject
When the batch file finishes building the shader PAK file for your game project, the following files appear in the lumberyard_version/dev/Build/es3/Game_Project_Name/ directory.
 ShaderCache.pak – Contains all compiled shaders that are only used when the shader can't be found in the current level's shader cache.
 ShaderCacheStartup.pak – Contains a subset of compiled shaders used to accelerate the startup time of the engine.
Packing Assets
To pack assets for your apps, copy and edit the example scripts that come with Lumberyard. 
To pack assets


Navigate to the lumberyard_version/dev directory.


Copy the BuildGame_Project_Paks_PC.bat file and rename it, such as BuildSamplesProject_Paks_ES3.bat.


In a text editor, for line 20, specify the game project and platform.


.\%BINFOLDER%\AssetProcessorBatch.exe /gamefolder=SamplesProject /platforms=es3

For line 25, make the following changes.

.\%BINFOLDER%\rc\rc.exe /job=%BINFOLDER%\rc\RCJob_Generic_MakePaks.xml /p=es3 /game=samplesproject
Note
For /p, specify es3 for Android. If you're building a game project other than SamplesProject, change the game parameter.


Save the file.


After you make the changes, run the script and wait for it to finish building the PAK files.


Running Your Own Project
If you create your own project, you must do the following.
 To ensure that you export every level, open them in Lumberyard Editor and press CtrlE. 
 To set your startup level, edit or create a file named autoexec.cfg in the root of your game project directory. For example, see lumberyard_version/dev/SamplesProject/autoexec.cfg.
 In a text editor, open the autoexec.cfg file, type in map followed by the name of the first level to load. 
Example 
map Camera_Sample
