Add Cloth Colliders to Characters

This feature is an experimental release and is subject to change. 
Applying cloth simulation to your characters adds realism and dynamism in their every movement. Adding cloth colliders to your characters greatly enhances the effect. Cloth colliders can prevent cloth from penetrating into the geometry of the character. To add cloth colliders, you must enable the NVIDIA Cloth Gem. 
For more information, see the NVIDIA Cloth Gem documentation.
