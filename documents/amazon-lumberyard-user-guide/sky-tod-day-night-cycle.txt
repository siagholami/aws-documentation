Setting a Day-Night Cycle
You can use the Time of Day Editor to configure changes to environment parameters over time to mimic a day-night lighting cycle. The Time of Day Editor uses a 24-hour timeline graph and a recording function to store changing environment parameter values in an XML file. 
Environment parameter values that you change in the Parameters panel of the Time of Day Editor are set for the currently selected time. 
The Time of Day graph shows changes to the selected parameter over time. When a parameter value is changed, the graph curve is updated for the currently selected time. You can also directly change the curve by dragging it up or down between the keyframe points. Keyframe points are displayed as yellow dots. You can insert new keyframe points by double-clicking the curve. To remove existing keyframe points, double-click the keyframes (yellow dots) themselves. Lumberyard interpolates parameter values for times that lie between keyframe points.
Example
The following is an example graph in the Time of Day Editor.  

To configure a day-night cycle


In Lumberyard Editor, choose Tools, Other, Time Of Day.


In the Parameters pane, adjust the parameter value for each cycle that you want to create, and then do the following:


Click the red button to start recording.


In the Time of Day Tasks pane, under Time, set the Current Time to apply the parameter value. The graph reflects the new value at the specified time.


Set a new parameter value and current time value pair. Repeat as many times as needed to get a realistic change over time for the parameter.


Click the red button to stop recording.


In the Time of Day Tasks pane, complete the following tasks as needed to export, import, and play a time-of-day (dayâ€“night) cycle.
