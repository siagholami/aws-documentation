Managing UI Anchors and Offsets
You can use anchors and offset settings in the Transform2D component to set a UI element's position and size relative to its parent's edges. The Transform2D component is a required component in every element.
Anchor values are always 0.00% to 100.00% as defined by the parent's edges. Offsets are expressed in pixels and are relative to the anchors.
Anchors and offsets are useful in a variety of situations:
 Ensuring that an element maintains a specific padding within its parent's edges, regardless of changes to the parent's size
 Anchoring an element to a corner of its parent, regardless of changes to the parent's size or position
 Building resolution-independent UI elements
For example, you can ensure an element remains full screen regardless of the screen's resolution.
To configure an element's anchors


In the Hierarchy pane of the UI Editor, select the element whose anchors you want to modify.


In the Properties pane, under Transform2D, choose from the selection of commonly used anchor placements.


Anchor to the parent's center, corner, or midway along an edge without changing size.


Anchor to the left edge, middle, or right edge; vertical size adjusts to parent.


Anchor to the top edge, middle, or bottom edge; horizontal size adjusts to parent.


Anchor all of the element's edges to the parent. The horizontal and vertical size adjusts to parent. You can use this anchor preset to place an element that remains full screen, regardless of a change in resolution. This applies if the canvas is its parent. 



To further edit (fine tune) an element's anchors
In the Properties pane, under Transform2D, do the following for Anchors, as appropriate:
 For Left, enter a value between 0.00% and 100.00%.
 For Right, enter a value between 0.00% and 100.00%.
 For Top, enter a value between 0.00% and 100.00%.
 For Bottom, enter a value between 0.00% and 100.00%.
The anchors' positions can be visualized as points on a grid, plotted in percentages by the length of its parent's edges from left to right and top to bottom. If you want to keep the element's size absolute (so that it doesn't change size when the parent changes size) but want to anchor it a particular vertical or horizontal point relative to the parent's size, make sure the top and bottom (or left and right) anchors have the same number. In this case, the anchors are said to be together.
But if, for example, you want the element's left and right edges to each remain at a fixed percentage relative to its parent and to change size as its parent changes size, then make the numbers different. In this case, the anchors are called split.

To edit an element's position and size
In the Properties pane, under Transform2D, modify the Offsets, as appropriate:
If the element's anchors are together, do the following:
 For X Pos, enter a negative or positive value in pixels. This adjusts the horizontal offset relative to the left-right anchor position. 
 For Y Pos, enter a negative or positive value in pixels. This adjusts the vertical offset relative to the top-bottom anchor position.
When the element's anchors are together, only its position adjusts with the parent's size. The element's size is not adjusted. Therefore, you can manually adjust the element's size, which remains consistent when anchors are together.
 For Width, enter a value in pixels.
 For Height, enter a value in pixels.
If the element's anchors are split, do the following:
 For Left, enter a negative or positive value in pixels. This adjusts the size offset relative to the element's left anchor.
 For Right, enter a negative or positive value in pixels. This adjusts the size offset relative to the element's right anchor.
 For Top, enter a negative or positive value in pixels. This adjusts the size offset relative to the element's top anchor.
 For Bottom, enter a negative or positive value in pixels. This adjusts the size offset relative to the element's bottom anchor.
To edit an element's pivot, rotation, and scale
In the Properties pane, under Transform2D, do the following for Pivot, Rotation, and Scale, as appropriate:
 For Pivot, select a pivot preset or enter values for X and Y where 0 and 1 represent the element's edges.
 For Rotation, enter a value in degrees.
 For X Scale, enter a value to use as a multiplier for the element's width.
 For Y Scale, enter a value to use as a multiplier for the element's height.
 Select Scale to Device if you want the UI element and its child elements to scale with the device resolution.
Note
The element rotates around, resizes from, and calculates position from its pivot point. The pivot point is not limited by the element's borders. You can place the pivot outside of the element.
Example: Using Anchors to Resize an Element Relative to its Parent
In the following example, anchors are used to resize the element relative to its parent. The layout column of buttons is resized as needed to stay on the screen. Because the layout column of buttons does not use the Scale to Device setting, the button text does not change size along with its parent button.
Note
You can configure the text element separately.
The layout column of buttons has the following settings.
