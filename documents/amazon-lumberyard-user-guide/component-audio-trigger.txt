Audio Trigger
The Audio Trigger component provides basic play and stop features so that you can set up Audio Translation Layer (ATL) play and stop triggers that can be executed on demand. With an audio trigger, you can also enable the player to run or stop audio triggers by name on entities.
Audio Trigger Properties
The Audio Trigger component has the following properties.
Default 'play' Trigger
Enter the name of the audio trigger that this component runs when 'play' is called. You can change this property to specify a different default audio trigger.
Default 'stop' Trigger
Enter the name of the audio trigger that this component runs when 'stop' is called. You can specify any trigger here; you do not need to specify a 'stop' trigger in order to stop audio, but it is a best practice to pair the two triggers. If you leave this setting blank, the 'stop' trigger simply stops the audio trigger specified for 'play'.
