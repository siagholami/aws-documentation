Setting Effect Strength Based on Camera Distance
You can use the fadeDistance attribute to set the effect strength based on the distance from the camera.
Example opening XML tag using the fadeDistance attribute:
<PostEffectGroup priority="1" fadeDistance="20">
fadeDistance â€“ Indicates how the effects are actualized based on the distance of the camera from the entity.
 When the camera is at the position of the entity, the effects are fully overridden.
 When the camera is less than fade distance from the entity, the effects are blended.
 When the camera is at least fade distance from the entity, the effects are set to the lower priority values.
Script Canvas Editor
You need to use a script to apply this effect group at the specified position for each frame. For more information, see the Apply Effect Group At Position node.
Example
The following script uses the Get World Translation to send the entity's position to the Apply Effect Group At Position node; this node then applies the effect group to that specified position.  

Lua
To enable an effect group using Lua, set the position at which to apply the effect by using the following function:
local pos = TransformBus.Event.GetWorldTranslation(EntityId) PostEffects.ApplyEffectGroupAtPosition("example.xml", pos)
Note
This function must be called once per frame while the effect group is enabled. If this function is called multiple times in a single frame, the effect strength increases each time, as if each call applies the effect from a different entity.
