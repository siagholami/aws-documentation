Using Pivot Mode
You can use pivot mode to use the default pivot or the entity's center as the manipulator point of reference. This feature is useful if you want to modify multiple entities using a central point of reference. 
Note
Currently, this is a global toggle and doesn't support mixed use cases, such as using the center of an entity to snap it to the pivot of another entity.
To use pivot mode


In the viewport, select an entity or group of entities.


Press P to switch between the pivot and the entity's center.
Example 


In the following example, the selected entities pivot around the manipulator.
