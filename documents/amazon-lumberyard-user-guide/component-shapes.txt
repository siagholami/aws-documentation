Shapes: Cylinder, Capsule, Disk, Box, Sphere, Compound
Add shape components to entities that have other components that require shapes.
For example, add shape components to your entities to create volumes for the following:
 Create a trigger volume using theTrigger Area component. Entities that enter the volume trigger an action.
 Create a collision volume using the PhysX Collider component. Entities that collide with the collision volume respond to the impact, such as slowing down or bouncing back.
 Define reverb or echo effects using the Audio Environment component. 
 Create an audio area using the Audio Trigger component so that a specific sound plays in that area of the level.
Note
You can add only one shape component to an entity. If you need more than one shape on an entity, create child entities.
Each shape component provides a generic ShapeService that exposes functionality common to all shapes. Each shape also provides a more specific service, such as BoxShapeService or SphereShapeService.
The Shape component includes the following shapes and properties:

Scaling Shapes
As a best practice, when you scale a shape, adjust the shape component's properties, such as its Dimensions, Height, and Radius.

Tip
Modify the shape component's properties instead using the Scale tool, which changes the entity's Transform component. 
Example
See the following examples for the different scaling:  


In nonuniform scaling, adjusting an entity's transform scale leads to different values for X, Y, and Z. 


In uniform scaling, X, Y, and Z have the same value. 


In uniform normalized scaling, all of the scale values are 1. 



If an entity has been scaled nonuniformly, rendering and intersection tests use the largest component of the scale vector. Although this can work, the best practice is to keep a uniform and, ideally, normalized (1, 1, 1) transform scale, as shown in the third example.
Box Shape Component Properties

The Box Shape component has the following properties.




Name
Description




Visible
The component always appears in the viewport, even if the entity isn't selected.


Game View
Renders the box shape in game mode in Lumberyard Editor. To enter game mode, press CtrlG.


Shape Color
Specifies the color to render the shape.


Dimensions
Defines dimensions of the shape along all three axes in local space.  If the Transform component applies a scale, these dimensions are multiplied by the same value.


Edit
Choose Edit, and the component is locked for editing. For more information, see Editing Components in the Viewport.



The Box Shape component also has its own Component Mode with several linear manipulators for each axis. 

Capsule Shape Component Properties

The Capsule Shapecomponent has the following properties.




Name
Description




Visible
The component always appears in the viewport, even if the entity isn't selected.


Game View
Renders the shape in game mode. To enter game mode, press Ctrl  G.


Shape Color
Specifies the color to render the shape.


Height
The end-to-end height of the capsule, including the cylinder and both caps.  If the Transform component applies a scale, these dimensions are multiplied by the same value.


Radius
The radius of the capsule. If the Transform component applies a scale, these dimensions are multiplied by the same value.



Compound Shape Component Properties

With the Compound Shape component, you can combine shapes to create a complex object to generate a physics collider, trigger shape, or any other application of shapes. The individual shapes might or might not be children of the entity with the Compound Shape component. 
Note
To move the shapes together with the compound shape, set them as child entities.
To move the shapes independent of the entity with the compound shape, don't set them as child entities. 
For EBus (event bus) requests, compound shapes service the full shape component bus. However, each individual shape that you add increases the cost of requests such as IsPointInside. 
See the following Compound Shape properties.




Name
Description




Child Shape Entities
Specifies the entities and their shapes that make up the compound shape. These entities might or might not be children of the entity with the compound shape.



Cylinder Shape Component Properties

Height
The height of the cylinder. If the Transform component applies a scale, these dimensions are multiplied by the same value.

Request EBus Interface
All shape components provide access to two separate request buses. The first bus is the [ShapeComponentRequestsBus](#component-shape-ebus-request) that returns general information about the shape component. The second bus is the ShapeNameComponentRequestsBus that returns property configurations for the specified shape.
Use the following request functions with the event bus interface to communicate with other components in your game.
For more information, see Working with the Event Bus (EBus) system.
