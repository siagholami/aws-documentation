Fog Systems
Lumberyard supports a standard fog system as well as a voxel-based volumetric fog system. Which one to use for your game comes down to balancing performance over visual quality. Volumetric fog looks superior but comes at a performance cost. The standard fog system is very cheap performance-wise to compute.
You can also add realistic-looking fog above water surfaces, as well as add volumetric fog shadows.
