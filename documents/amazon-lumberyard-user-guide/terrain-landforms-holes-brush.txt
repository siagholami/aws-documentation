Using the Holes Brush

This topic references tools and features that are legacy. If you want to use legacy tools in Lumberyard Editor, disable the CryEntity Removal gem using the Project Configurator or the command line. To learn more about legacy features, see the Lumberyard Legacy Reference.
The Holes brush makes a geometrical hole in both the terrain layer as well as the visual mesh. It is useful for creating craters, sinkholes, caves, and other areas beneath or inside the terrain. The resulting holes can be filled with various objects such as rocks or vegetation.
To use the Holes brush


In the Rollup Bar, on the Terrain tab, click Holes.


Adjust the Brush Radius slider to adjust the size of the hole.


Click Make Hole to create a hole.


In the level, click to place the hole. By default you can see the ocean showing through.


To remove a hole, click Remove Hole. You are limited to removing one terrain unit adjacent to the existing terrain.
