Mesh
You can add the Mesh component to an entity to provide visual geometry on an entity. The Mesh component has key controls and options for Lumberyard's basic rendering features. The supported geometry type is meshes (.cgf).
Mesh Component Properties

The Mesh component has the following properties:




Property
Description




Visible
Entity is visible.


Mesh asset
Specifies the asset file for the mesh entity.


Material override
Specifies an override material.


Opacity
The entity's degree of transparency.


Max view distance
Maximum distance from which this entity can be viewed.


View distance multiplier
Adjusts the maximum view distance. If set to 1.0, then the default maximum view distance is used. For example, 1.1 extends the default by 10%.


LOD distance ratio
Sets the level of detail (LOD) ratio over distance.


Cast shadows
Casts shadow maps.


Use VisAreas
Allows vis areas to control the component's visibility.



Advanced
The Mesh component has different advanced properties that depend on whether your mesh is static or dynamic.
 A mesh is dynamic when the Static property is not set on the Transform component. This is the default setting when you create an entity. Dynamic meshes do not affect nav meshes. 
 A mesh is static when the Static property is set on the Transform component. You can use static objects for more optimal paths during rendering and processing. We recommend that you create static meshes whenever possible. A static mesh can move or deform only when the Receive Wind or Deformable Mesh properties are set. 
For more information, see Transform Component Properties.
Advanced Properties for Dynamic Meshes
If your mesh is dynamic, the Mesh component has the following advanced properties.





Property
Description




Receive wind
Affected by wind.


Accept decals
Receives decals.


Deformable mesh
Allows static mesh assets to deform that have specific dynamic data. For example, you can have a mesh deform asset that is stationary.



Advanced Properties for Static Meshes
If the mesh is static, the Mesh component has the following advanced properties.





Property
Description




Rain occluder
Blocks or stops dynamic raindrops.


Affect dynamic water
Generates ripples in dynamic water.


Receive wind
Affected by wind.


Accept decals
Receives decals.


Affect navmesh
Affects navmesh generation.


Visibility occluder
Blocks visibility of other objects.


Deformable mesh
Allows static mesh assets to deform that have specific dynamic data. For example, you can have a mesh deform asset that is stationary.


Affects GI
Affects global illumination results.



Note
If you select the Receive wind or Deformable mesh settings, the entity's Transform component remains Static, but the mesh is considered dynamic.
