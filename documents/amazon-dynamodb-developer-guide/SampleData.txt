Step 3: Query the Data
Topics
In this step, you try some simple queries against the tables that you created, using the Amazon DynamoDB console.


Open the DynamoDB console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/.


In the navigation pane, choose Tables.


In the list of tables, choose Reply.


Choose the Items tab to view the data that you loaded into the table.


Choose the data filtering link, located just below the Create item button.



When you choose the link, the console reveals a data filtering pane.



In the data filtering pane, do the following:


Change the operation from Scan to Query.


For the Partition key, enter the value Amazon DynamoDB#DynamoDB Thread 1.


Choose Start. Only the items that match your query criteria are returned from the Reply table.


The Reply table has a global secondary index on the PostedBy and Message attributes. You can use the data filtering pane to query the index. Do the following:


Change the query source from the following:
[Table] Reply: Id, ReplyDateTime
To the following:
[Index] PostedBy-Message-Index: PostedBy, Message


For the Partition key, enter the value User A.


Choose Start. Only the items that match your query criteria are returned from PostedBy-Message-Index.
