Getting Started with Java and DynamoDB
In this tutorial, you use the AWS SDK for Java to write simple programs to perform the following Amazon DynamoDB operations:
 Create a table called Movies and load sample data in JSON format.
 Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on the table.
 Run simple queries.
The SDK for Java offers several programming models for different use cases. In this exercise, the Java code uses the document model that provides a level of abstraction that makes it easier for you to work with JSON documents.
As you work through this tutorial, you can refer to the AWS SDK for Java Documentation.
Tutorial Prerequisites

Download and run DynamoDB on your computer. For more information, see Setting Up DynamoDB Local (Downloadable Version). 

DynamoDB (downloadable version) is also available as part of the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse. For more information, see AWS Toolkit For Eclipse.
Note
You use the downloadable version of DynamoDB in this tutorial. For information about how to run the same code against the DynamoDB web service, see the Summary.
 Set up an AWS access key to use the AWS SDKs. For more information, see Setting Up DynamoDB (Web Service). 
 Set up the AWS SDK for Java:
   Install a Java development environment. If you are using the Eclipse IDE, install the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse.
   Install the AWS SDK for Java.
   Set up your AWS security credentials for use with the SDK for Java.
