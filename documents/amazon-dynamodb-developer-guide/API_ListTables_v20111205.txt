ListTables
Important*
This section refers to API version 2011-12-05, which is deprecated and should not be used for new applications.
*For documentation on the current low-level API, see the Amazon DynamoDB API Reference.
Description
Returns an array of all the tables associated with the current account and endpoint.
Each DynamoDB endpoint is entirely independent. For example, if you have two tables called "MyTable," one in dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com and one in dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com, they are completely independent and do not share any data. The ListTables operation returns all of the table names associated with the account making the request, for the endpoint that receives the request.
