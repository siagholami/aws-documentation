# Creating Tables and Loading Data for Code Examples in DynamoDB<a name="SampleData"></a>

In this tutorial, you use the AWS Management Console to create tables in Amazon DynamoDB\. You then load data into these tables using the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\.

These tables and their data are used as examples throughout this developer guide\.

**Note**  
If you are an application developer, we recommend that you also read [Getting Started with DynamoDB and AWS SDKs](GettingStarted.md), which uses the downloadable version of DynamoDB\. This lets you learn about the DynamoDB low\-level API without having to pay any fees for throughput, storage, or data transfer\.
