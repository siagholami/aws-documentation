# Step 1: Create a Table<a name="getting-started-step-1"></a>

In this step, you create a `Music` table in Amazon DynamoDB\. The table has the following details:
+ Partition key — `Artist`
+ Sort key — `SongTitle`

For more information about table operations, see [Working with Tables and Data in DynamoDB](WorkingWithTables.md)\. 

**Note**  
Before you begin, make sure that you followed the steps in [Prerequisites \- Getting Started Tutorial](GettingStarted.SettingUp.DynamoWebService.md)\.

After creating the new table, proceed to [Step 2: Write Data to a Table Using the Console or AWS CLI](getting-started-step-2.md)\.
