# Step 3: Read Data from a Table<a name="getting-started-step-3"></a>

In this step, you will read back an item that was created in [Step 2: Write Data to a Table Using the Console or AWS CLI](getting-started-step-2.md)\. You can use the DynamoDB console or the AWS CLI to read an item from the `Music` table by specifying `Artist` and `SongTitle`\. 

For more information about read operations in DynamoDB, see [Reading an Item](WorkingWithItems.md#WorkingWithItems.ReadingData)\. 

To update the data in your table, proceed to [Step 4: Update Data in a Table](getting-started-step-4.md)\.
