# Managing Machine Learning Models in Amazon Pinpoint<a name="ml-models-managing"></a>

The **Machine learning models** page on the Amazon Pinpoint console provides a single location for you to view, change, and manage Amazon Pinpoint configuration settings for all the machine learning \(ML\) models that you've connected to your Amazon Pinpoint account in the current AWS Region\. By using this page, you can perform management tasks such as viewing, changing, and deleting configuration settings for connections to ML models\. You can also configure Amazon Pinpoint to connect to and use data from additional ML models\.

## Viewing Your Collection of Models<a name="ml-models-managing-view-all"></a>

The **Machine learning models** page displays a list of all the configurations that you created to enable Amazon Pinpoint to connect to and use data from specific ML models for your account\. To browse the list more easily or find specific configurations quickly, you can sort and filter the list, choose which columns to display, and change other display settings for the list\.

**To view your collection of ML models**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Machine learning models**\. The **Machine learning models** page opens and displays the number of configurations in your collection and a list of those configurations\.

1. To customize the list or find a specific configuration quickly, choose any of the following options:
   + To sort the list by a specific type of value, click the column heading for that value\. To change the sort order from ascending to descending or vice versa, click the column heading again\. 
   + To apply a filter that displays only those configurations whose names contain specific text, enter the text in the **Search** box above the list\. To remove the filter, choose **X** in the **Search** box\.
   + To change the number of configurations that are displayed in the list, choose the settings icon at the top of the page\. Then, for **Page size**, choose the number of configurations that you want to display, and choose **Save changes**\.
   + To add or remove columns from the list, choose the settings icon at the top of the page\. Then, for **Choose visible columns**, turn each column on or off, and choose **Save changes**\.

## Viewing the Settings for a Model<a name="ml-models-managing-open"></a>

By using the **Machine learning models** page, you can quickly find and open a specific configuration to view its settings and other information\. For example, you can view a list of the attributes that the model provides for use in messages\. After you open a configuration to view its settings, you can also [change the settings for the configuration](#ml-models-managing-change)\.

**To view the settings for an ML model**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Machine learning models**\.

1. On the **Machine learning models** page, choose the configuration whose settings you want to view\.

The configuration page opens and displays the current settings for the configuration\.

## Changing the Settings for a Model<a name="ml-models-managing-change"></a>

Before you change the configuration settings for an ML model, it's important to note that Amazon Pinpoint automatically applies your changes to message templates that use the model\. \(It applies the changes to both the active and latest versions of the template\.\) This means that your changes also affect any messages that use those templates and haven't been sent yet, such as campaign messages that are scheduled to be sent at a later time\.

For this reason, your changes might prevent Amazon Pinpoint from sending messages that use the configuration and haven't been sent yet\. Or, your changes could cause those messages to display in unexpected or unwanted ways\. This depends on the configuration settings that you change\. It also depends on how you designed the templates that use the model\.

If you change the configuration settings for an ML model, be sure to also review and make the appropriate changes to any templates that use the current configuration for the model\. For example, if you delete an attribute, be sure to also remove or replace that attribute in every template that uses the attribute\. Also, be sure to make those changes to the appropriate versions of each message template\. For more information, see [Editing a Message Template](message-templates-managing.md#message-templates-managing-edit)\.

If you don't want to apply your changes to existing templates and messages, you can [create a copy of the configuration](#ml-models-managing-copy), and save the copy with the changes that you want\. You can then use the configuration copy in new templates, or update existing templates to use the configuration copy\.

**To change the settings for an ML model**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Machine learning models**\.

1. On the **Machine learning models** page, choose the configuration that you want to change\. The configuration page opens and displays the current settings for the configuration\.

1. Choose **Edit model**\.

1. On the **Set up model** page, make any changes that you want\. You can change any of the settings, except the name of the configuration\. To change the name of the configuration, you can [create a copy of the configuration](#ml-models-managing-copy), save the copy with the name that you want, and then optionally [delete the original configuration](#ml-models-managing-delete)\.

1. When you finish making any changes to these settings, choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Add attributes** page, make any changes that you want, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Review and publish** page, review the new settings and make sure that they're what you want\. If they are, choose **Publish** to save your changes\.

## Copying a Model<a name="ml-models-managing-copy"></a>

To quickly create a new configuration that's similar to an existing configuration for an ML model, you can create a copy of the configuration\. You can then change settings for the configuration copy, without changing the original configuration\.

**To copy an ML model**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Machine learning models**\.

1. On the **Machine learning models** page, select the check box next to the configuration that you want to copy\.

1. On the **Actions** menu, choose **Duplicate**\.

1. For **Recommender model name**, enter a name for the configuration copy\. The name has to begin with a letter or number\. It can contain up to 128 characters\. The characters can be letters, numbers, underscores \(\_\), or hyphens \(‚Äê\)\. 

1. When you finish entering the name, choose **Duplicate model**\. The configuration page opens and displays the current settings for the configuration that you copied\.

1. \(Optional\) To change the configuration copy, choose **Edit model**, and then make the changes that you want\. When you finish, choose **Publish**\.

## Deleting a Model<a name="ml-models-managing-delete"></a>

If you want to remove the configuration for an ML model from Amazon Pinpoint completely, you can delete the configuration\. When you delete a configuration, Amazon Pinpoint deletes all settings for the configuration and the configuration becomes unavailable for use in both new and existing message templates\. You can't recover a configuration after you delete it\.

**Warning**  
If you delete a configuration, Amazon Pinpoint won't be able to send messages that use the configuration and haven't been sent yet, such as campaign messages that are scheduled to be sent at a later time\. Before you delete a configuration, review and update the contents and settings for message templates that use the configuration\. Also, review any campaigns and journey activities that use those templates, and update them as necessary\. 

If you delete a configuration, Amazon Pinpoint doesn't delete any resources or data that's used by the configuration and stored in other AWS services\. This includes Amazon Personalize solutions and campaigns, and any AWS Lambda functions\.

**To delete an ML model**

1. Open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose ** Machine learning models**\.

1. On the **Machine learning models** page, select the check box next to each configuration that you want to delete\.

1. On the **Actions** menu, choose **Delete**\.

1. In the window that appears, enter **delete** to confirm that you want to delete the selected configurations, and then choose **Delete models**\.
