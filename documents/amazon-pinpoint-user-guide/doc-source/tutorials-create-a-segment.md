# Create a Segment<a name="tutorials-create-a-segment"></a>

This tutorial contains a complete set of procedures for using Amazon Pinpoint to create a segment\. The segment you create in this tutorial includes several attributes\. It also excludes customers who are members of a separate "blacklist" segment\.

It can be helpful to create blacklist segments when you have groups of users that you consistently need to exclude from your communications\. For example, you might want to send a message to all users of your app, except for those who use version 4\.2\.
