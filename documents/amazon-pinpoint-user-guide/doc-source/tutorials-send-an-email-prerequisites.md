## Create an AWS Account<a name="tutorials-send-an-email-create-account"></a>

If you haven't done so already, you have to create an AWS account before you can use Amazon Pinpoint or other AWS services\.

**To create an AWS account**

1. Go to [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/), and choose **Get Started with Amazon Pinpoint**\.

1. Follow the on\-screen instructions to create your account\.

## Create an IAM User and Obtain Credentials<a name="tutorials-send-an-email-prerequisites-iam"></a>

To send email using Amazon Pinpoint, you have to create an IAM user account\. When you create your account, you're provided with a set of credentials that you use to configure the AWS CLI\.

**To create an account and obtain your credentials**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose **Add user**\.

1. Under **Set user details**, for **User name**, type a name for your user account\.

1. Under **Select AWS access type**, do the following:

   1. For **Access Type**, select **Programmatic access** and **AWS Management Console access**\.

   1. For **Console password**, select **Autogenerated password**\. 

   1. Select **Require password reset**\.

   1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Set permissions** page, do the following:

   1. Choose **Attach existing policies directly**\.

   1. In the list of policies, choose **PowerUserAccess**\.
**Tip**  
To quickly find this role, use the search box at the top of the list of user roles\.

   1. Choose **Next: Review**\.

1. Choose **Create user**\. The IAM console shows a list of the users that it just created\.

1. Choose **Download \.csv**\. Save the \.csv file to your computer, and then open the file\. You need the values in the **Access key ID ** and **Secret access key ** columns to configure the AWS CLI\.

## Install the AWS CLI<a name="tutorials-send-an-email-prerequisites-cli-install"></a>

Now that you've created an IAM user, you can install the AWS CLI\. The process for installing the AWS CLI depends on what kind of computer you use\.

### Installing the AWS CLI on a Windows\-based Computer<a name="tutorials-send-an-email-prerequisites-cli-install-windows"></a>

If you use a Windows\-based computer, you can download a file that installs the AWS CLI to your computer\.
