# Setting Up the Amazon Pinpoint Email Channel<a name="channels-email-setup"></a>

To set up the Amazon Pinpoint email channel, you start by creating a new project\. Then you specify and verify the email address that you want to use when you send email from that project\.

When you enable the email channel for the first time, Amazon Pinpoint doesn't immediately provide production access for email messaging\. Instead, your AWS account has access only to the email sandbox, which imposes restrictions on your email traffic\. To gain production access, [submit a request](channels-email-setup-production-access.md) to AWS Support\.
