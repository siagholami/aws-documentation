You can use the voice channel to create voice messages from a text script, and then send those messages to your customers over the phone\. The voice channel is a great way to reach customers whose phone numbers aren't able to receive SMS messagesâ€”for example, customers who use landlines or VoIP services\.

To send voice messages using Amazon Pinpoint, you first have to enable the voice channel in your project and lease a dedicated phone number for sending the messages\. Depending on how you use Amazon Pinpoint to send voice messages, you might also want to change certain settings for your account\.
