# Step 1: Create a New Amazon Pinpoint Project<a name="tutorials-send-an-email-new-project"></a>

Before you can send email using Amazon Pinpoint, you first have to create a project\. A *project* is a collection of settings, segments, campaigns, and analytics for a specific set of customer engagements\.

Part of creating an email campaign involves verifying an identity\. In Amazon Pinpoint, an *identity* is an email address or domain that you use to send email\. Before you can send email using Amazon Pinpoint, you must verify each identity that you plan to use as a "From", "Source", "Sender", or "Return\-Path" address to prove that you own it\. If your account is still in the Amazon Pinpoint sandbox, you also need to verify the identities that you plan to send emails to\.

The procedure in this section shows you how to create a new email project by using the Amazon Pinpoint console\.
