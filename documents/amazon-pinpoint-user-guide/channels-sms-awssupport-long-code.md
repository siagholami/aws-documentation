# Requesting Dedicated Long Codes for SMS Messaging with Amazon Pinpoint<a name="channels-sms-awssupport-long-code"></a>

A long code \(also referred to as a long virtual number, or LVN\) is a standard phone number that contains up to 12 digits, depending on the country that it's based in\. Long codes are typically meant for low\-volume, person\-to\-person communication\. However, you can also use long codes for sending test messages, or for sending low volumes of messages to your customers\.

**Note**  
In the United States and Canada, sending rates for long codes are restricted to 1 message per second\. This restriction is set by the phone carriers, and isn't a limitation of Amazon Pinpoint\. This restriction might be higher or lower in other countries and regions\. If you send a large volume of messages from a long code, wireless carriers might begin to block your messages\. If you [send SMS messages programmatically](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/send-messages-sms.html), your applications should limit the number of messages that they send each second\.

After we receive your request, we send you information about the costs associated with obtaining a long code in your country or region\. We also provide an estimate of the amount of time that's required to provision a long code in your country or region\. 

**Note**  
If you're new to SMS messaging with Amazon Pinpoint, you should also request a monthly SMS spending threshold that meets the expected demands of your SMS use case\. By default, your monthly spending threshold is $1\.00 \(USD\)\. For more information, see [Requesting Increases to Your Monthly SMS Spending Quota for Amazon Pinpoint](channels-sms-awssupport-spend-threshold.md)\.

However, in some countries and regions, it can take several weeks to obtain a dedicated long code for the SMS channel\.

In order to prevent our systems from being used to send unsolicited or malicious content, we have to consider each request carefully\. We might not be able to grant your request if your use case doesnâ€™t align with our policies\.
