Add a custom domain managed by Google Domains
To add a custom domain managed by Google Domains


Follow steps one through six of the procedure To add a custom domain managed by a third-party DNS provider.


Log in to your account at https://domains.google.com and choose DNS in the left navigation pane.


Scroll down the page to Custom resource records where you need to add two new CNAME records.


Create the first CNAME record to point all subdomains to the Amplify domain as follows:


For Name, enter only the subdomain name. For example, if your subdomain is www.example.com, enter www for Name.


For Data, enter the value that's available in the Amplify Console. 
If the Amplify Console displays the domain for your app as xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net, enter xxxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net for Data.


Create the second CNAME record to point to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) validation server. A single validated ACM generates an SSL certificate for your domain. 


For Name, enter the subdomain.
For example, if the DNS record in the Amplify Console for verifying ownership of your subdomain is _c3e2d7eaf1e656b73f46cd6980fdc0e.example.com, enter only _c3e2d7eaf1e656b73f46cd6980fdc0e for Name. 


For Data, enter the ACM validation certificate.
For example, if the validation server is _68126cb4e8b7ab90c515ea3edb5be60d.hkvuiqjoua.acm-validations.aws., enter _68126cb4e8b7ab90c515ea3edb5be60d.hkvuiqjoua.acm-validations.aws. for Data. 



Google Domains doesn’t support ANAME/ALIAS records. For DNS providers that don't have ANAME/ALIAS support, we strongly recommend migrating your DNS to Amazon Route 53. For more information, see Configuring Amazon Route 53 as your DNS service. If you want to keep Google Domains as your provider and update the root domain, set up a subdomain forward. Locate the Synthetic records pane. For Subdomain, enter the @ symbol to specify the root domain. For Destination URL, enter your subdomain to forward to.



Note
 Updates to your DNS settings for a Google domain can take up to 48 hours to take effect. For help with resolving errors that occur, see Troubleshooting custom domains.
