Restricting access
If you are working on unreleased features you can password protect feature branches that are not ready to be accessed publicly.

To set passwords on feature branches


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amplify Console.


Choose the app you want to set feature branch passwords on.


In the navigation pane, choose App settings, and then choose Access control.


In the Access control settings section, choose Manage access.



Do one of the following in Access control settings:
    To set a username and password that applies to all connected branches, turn on Apply a global password. For example, if you have main, dev, and feature branches connected, you can use a global password to set the same user name and password for all branches.
    To exclude branches from a global password, turn on Apply a global password, and then choose Publicly viewable for Access setting for any branch that you want to exclude.
    To apply a username and password to an individual branch, turn off Apply a global password. For the branch that you want to enter a unique username and password for, choose Restricted-password required for Access setting and enter a username and password.
