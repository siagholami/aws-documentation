Receiving Events from an SaaS Partner
To be able to receive events from SaaS partner applications and services, you must have a partner event source offered to you from the partner. You can then create a partner event bus and match it to the corresponding partner event source.

To begin to receive events from an SaaS partner


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Partner event sources.


Find the partner that you want and choose Set up for that partner.


Choose Copy to copy your account ID to the clipboard.


In the navigation pane, choose Partner event sources.


Go to the partner's website and follow the instructions to create a partner event source. Use your account ID for this. The event source that you create will be available to only your account.


Go back to the EventBridge console and choose Partner event sources in the navigation pane.


Select the button next to the partner event source, and choose Associate with event bus. 


The status of that event source changes from Pending to Active, and the name of the event bus is updated to match the partner event source name. You can now start creating rules that trigger on events from that partner event source. For more information, see Creating a Rule That Triggers on an SaaS Partner Event.
