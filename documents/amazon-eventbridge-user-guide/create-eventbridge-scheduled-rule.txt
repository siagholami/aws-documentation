Creating an EventBridge Rule That Triggers on a Schedule
Use the following steps to create an EventBridge rule that triggers on a regular schedule. You can create scheduled rules only using the default event bus.
To create a rule that triggers on a regular schedule


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rules.


Choose Create rule.


Enter a name and description for the rule.


A rule can't have the same name as another rule in the same Region and on the same event bus.


For Define pattern, choose Schedule.


Either choose Fixed rate of and specify how often the task is to run, or choose Cron expression and specify a cron expression that defines when the task is to be triggered. For more information about cron expression syntax, see Schedule Expressions for Rules.


For Select event bus, choose AWS default event bus. Scheduled rules are supported only on the default event bus.


For Select targets, choose the AWS service that is to act on the specified schedule.


In the other fields in this section, enter information specific to this target type, if any is needed. 


For many target types, EventBridge needs permissions to send events to the target. In these cases, EventBridge can create the IAM role needed for your rule to run: 
    To create an IAM role automatically, choose Create a new role for this specific resource
    To use an IAM role that you created before, choose Use existing role


(Optional) Choose Add target to add another target for this rule.


(Optional) Enter one or more tags for the rule. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon EventBridge Resources.


Choose Create.
