Creating an EventBridge Rule That Triggers on an Event from an AWS Resource
Use the following steps to create an EventBridge rule that triggers on an event emitted by an AWS service.
When an AWS service in your account emits an event, it always goes to your account’s default event bus. To write a rule that triggers on events from AWS services in your account, you must associate it with the default event bus. You can create a rule on a custom event bus that looks for events from AWS services, but this rule will trigger only when you receive such an event from another account via cross-account event delivery. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts.
To create a rule that triggers on an event


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rules.


Choose Create rule.


Enter a name and description for the rule.


A rule can't have the same name as another rule in the same Region and on the same event bus.


For Define pattern, choose Event pattern.


Choose Pre-defined pattern by service.


For Service provider, choose AWS.


For Service name, choose the name of the service that emits the event.


For Event type, choose All Events or choose the type of event to use for this rule. If you choose All Events, all events emitted by this AWS service will match the rule.


If you want to customize the event pattern, choose Edit, make your changes, and choose Save.


For Select event bus, choose the event bus that you want to associate with this rule. If you want this rule to trigger on matching events that come from your own AWS account, select  AWS default event bus. When an AWS service in your account emits an event, it always goes to your account’s default event bus. 


For Select targets, choose the AWS service that is to act when an event of the selected type is detected.


In the other fields in this section, enter information specific to this target type, if any is needed. 


For many target types, EventBridge needs permissions to send events to the target. In these cases, EventBridge can create the IAM role needed for your rule to run: 
    To create an IAM role automatically, choose Create a new role for this specific resource
    To use an IAM role that you created before, choose Use existing role


Optionally, choose Add target to add another target for this rule.


(Optional) Enter one or more tags for the rule. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon EventBridge Resources.


Choose Create.
