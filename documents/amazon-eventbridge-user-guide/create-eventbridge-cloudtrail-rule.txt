Creating an EventBridge Rule That Triggers on an AWS API Call Using AWS CloudTrail
To create a rule that triggers on an action by an AWS service that does not emit events, you can base the rule on API calls made by that service. The API calls are recorded by AWS CloudTrail. For more information about the API calls that you can use as triggers for rules, see Services Supported by CloudTrail Event History.
Rules in EventBridge work only in the Region where they're created. If you configure CloudTrail to track API calls in multiple Regions and you want a rule based on CloudTrail to trigger in each of those Regions, you must create a separate rule in each Region that you want to track.
All events that are delivered via CloudTrail have AWS API Call via CloudTrail as the value for detail-type.
Note
You might accidentally create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If you don't write the rule carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.
To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions don't refire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state instead of after any change. 
An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified quota. For more information, see Managing Your Costs with Budgets in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
To create a rule that triggers on an API call via CloudTrail


Open the Amazon EventBridge console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rules.


Choose Create rule.


Enter a name and description for the rule.


A rule can't have the same name as another rule in the same Region and on the same event bus.


For Define pattern, choose Event pattern.


Choose Pre-defined pattern by service.


For Service provider, choose AWS.


For Service name, choose the name of the service that emits the event.


For Event type, choose AWS API Call via CloudTrail.


If you want to customize the event pattern, choose Edit, make your changes, and choose Save.


For Select event bus, choose the event bus that you want to associate with this rule.


For Select event bus, choose the event bus that you want to associate with this rule. If you want this rule to trigger on matching events that come from your own AWS account, select  AWS default event bus. When an AWS service in your account emits an event, it always goes to your accountâ€™s default event bus. >


In the other fields in this section, enter information specific to this target type, if any is needed. 


For many target types, EventBridge needs permissions to send events to the target. In these cases, EventBridge can create the IAM role needed for your rule to run: 
    To create an IAM role automatically, choose Create a new role for this specific resource
    To use an IAM role that you created before, choose Use existing role


(Optional) Choose Add target to add another target for this rule.


(Optional) Enter one or more tags for the rule. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon EventBridge Resources.


Choose Create.
