| Resource | Default Limit | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Event Publishing API requests  |  [PutEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchEvents/latest/APIReference/API_PutEvents.html) operations are limited based on AWS region\. See [PutEvents Quotas by Region](#putevents-limits)\. You can [request a quota increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudwatch-events)\. For instructions, see [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html)   | 
|  All other API requests  |  All EventBridge API other than `PutEvents` are limited to 50 requests per second by default\. You can [request a quota increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudwatch-events)\. For instructions, see [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html)   | 
|  Event buses  |  Up to 100 event buses per account\.  | 
|  Event buses \- other quotas  |  There is no restriction on the rate of events that can be received from AWS services or other AWS accounts\. If you send custom events to your event bus using the `PutEvents` API, the `PutEvents` [API quotas](#putevents-limits) apply\. Any events that are sent on to the targets of the rules in your account count against your invocations quota\.  The policy size of an event bus is limited to 10240 characters\. This policy size increases each time you grant access to another account\. You can see your current policy and its size by using the `DescribeEventBus` API\. You can [request a quota increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudwatch-events)\. For instructions, see [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html)\.   | 
|  Event pattern  |  2048 characters maximum\.  | 
|  Invocations  |  An invocation is an event matching a rule and being sent on to the rule’s targets\. Quotas vary by region\. See [Invocation Quotas by Region](#invocations-limits)\. You can [request a quota increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudwatch-events)\. For instructions, see [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html)\.  | 
|  [ListRuleNamesByTarget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchEvents/latest/APIReference/API_ListRuleNamesByTarget.html)  |  Up to 100 results per page for requests\.  | 
|  [ListRules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchEvents/latest/APIReference/API_ListRules.html)  |  Up to 100 results per page for requests\.  | 
|  [ListTargetsByRule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchEvents/latest/APIReference/API_ListTargetsByRule.html)  |  Up to 100 results per page for requests\.  | 
|  [PutTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchEvents/latest/APIReference/API_PutTargets.html)  |  10 entries per request\. Up to 5 targets per rule\.  | 
|  [RemoveTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchEvents/latest/APIReference/API_RemoveTargets.html)  |  10 entries per request\.  | 
|  Rules  |  300 per event bus\. You can [request a quota increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudwatch-events)\. For instructions, see [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html)\. Before requesting a quota increase, examine your rules\. You may have multiple rules each matching to very specific events\. Consider broadening their scope by using fewer identifiers in your [Events and Event Patterns in EventBridge](eventbridge-and-event-patterns.md)\. In addition, a rule can invoke several targets each time it matches an event\. Consider adding more targets to your rules\.  | 
| Systems Manager Run Command target | 1 target key and 1 target value Systems Manager Run Command does not currently support multiple target values\.  | 
|  Targets  |  Up to 5 targets per rule\.  |

## Invocation Quotas by Region<a name="invocations-limits"></a>

An invocation is an event matching a rule and being sent on to the rule’s targets\. If the invocation of a target fails due to a problem with the target service, account throttling, etc\., new attempts are made for up to 24 hours for a specific invocation\.

If you are receiving events from another account, each of those events that matches a rule in your account and is sent on to the rule’s targets counts against your account’s quota of invocations per second\.

After your reach the one of the following invocation quotas in your region invocations are throttled\. They still happen but they are delayed\.
