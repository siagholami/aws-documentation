Realtime Servers Client API (C#) Reference
Use the Realtime Client API to prepare your multiplayer game clients for use with Amazon GameLift Realtime Servers. For more on the integration process, see Get Started with Realtime Servers. The Client API contains a set of synchronous API calls and asynchronous callbacks that enable a game client to connect to a Realtime server and exchange messages and data with other game clients via the server. 
This API is defined in the following libraries: 
Client.cs 
 Synchronous Actions
 Asynchronous Callbacks
 Data Types
To set up the Realtime Client API
