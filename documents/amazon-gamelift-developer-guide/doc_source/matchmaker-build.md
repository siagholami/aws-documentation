# Setting Up Amazon GameLift FlexMatch Matchmakers<a name="matchmaker-build"></a>

A FlexMatch matchmaker process does the work of building a game match\. It manages the pool of matchmaking requests received, forms teams for a match, processes and selects players to find the best possible player groups, and initiates the process of placing and starting a game session for the match\. This topic describes the key aspects of a matchmaker and how to configure one customized for your game\. 

For a detailed description of how a FlexMatch matchmaker processes the matchmaking requests it receives, see [Matchmaking Process](gamelift-match.md#gamelift-match-howitworks)\.
