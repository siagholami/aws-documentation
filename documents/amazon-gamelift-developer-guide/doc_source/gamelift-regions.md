# Using Amazon GameLift in AWS Regions<a name="gamelift-regions"></a>

Amazon GameLift is available in multiple AWS regions\. For a complete list of AWS regions and endpoints, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#gamelift_region)\. A global AWS account allows you to work with resources in most regions\.

When using Amazon GameLift for resources in the China \(Beijing\) Region, which is operated by Sinnet, keep in mind that you need to have a separate AWS \(China\) account\. In addition, there are some differences in how Amazon GameLift is implemented, including how it handles cross\-region interactions\. For more information on using Amazon GameLift in the China \(Beijing\) Region, see these resources:
