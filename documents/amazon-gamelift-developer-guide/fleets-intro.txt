Setting Up Amazon GameLift Fleets
This section provides detailed help with designing, building, and managing your fleets. Start with Design a Amazon GameLift Fleet for Your Game to learn about the various options for creating a fleet. 
Fleets are your hosting resources in the form of a set of EC2 instances. To host game servers on Amazon GameLift, deploy a fleet with either a custom game server or Realtime Servers. The size of a fleet depends on the number of instances you give it, and you can adjust fleet size to meet player demand either manually or by auto-scaling. 
Most games in production require more than one fleet. You need multiple fleets if, for example, you want to host players in more than one region, or if you have two or more versions of your game server build or script (such as free and premium versions).

Once you have a fleet up and running, you can create a fleet alias, add the fleet to a game session queue, and manage fleet capacity.
