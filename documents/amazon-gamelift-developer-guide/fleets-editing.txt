Manage Fleet Records
Use the Amazon GameLift console or the AWS CLI to manage your existing fleets, including updating the fleet's attributes, port settings, and runtime configuration. You can also delete a fleet.
Update a Fleet
Use the Edit fleet page in the Amazon GameLift console to change a fleet's configuration. All fleet properties can be changed except for the build ID and the instance type. To change scaling settings, see Auto-Scale Fleet Capacity.
Note
An active fleet may be deployed with a build that has been deleted or is in an error state. This does not affect the fleet's status or ability to host game sessions. In this situation, you may see a Build status of Deleted or Error (if an error occurred while retrieving the build info). 

[ GameLift Console ]
To update a fleet configuration


Open the Amazon GameLift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/.


Choose Fleets from the menu bar to view a list of fleets, and click on the name of the fleet you want to update. A fleet must be in ACTIVE status before it can be edited.


On the Fleet detail page, under Actions, choose Edit fleet.


On the Edit fleet page, you can make the following updates (see Deploy a GameLift Fleet for a Custom Game Build for more detailed field descriptions):
    Change the fleet attributes such as Name and Description. 
    Add or remove Metric groups, which are are used in Amazon CloudWatch to track aggregated Amazon GameLift metrics for multiple fleets.
    Change how you want server processes to run and host game sessions by updating the Server process allocation (runtime configuration) and game session activation settings. 
    Update the  EC2 port settings used to connect to server processes on this fleet. 
    Update resource creation limit settings. 
     Turn game session protection on or off.


Click Submit to save your changes.



[ AWS CLI ]
Use the following AWS CLI commands to update a fleet:
 update-fleet-attributes
 update-fleet-port-settings
 update-runtime-configuration

Delete a Fleet
You can delete a fleet when it is no longer needed. Deleting a fleet permanently removes all data associated with game sessions and player sessions, as well as collected metric data. As an alternative, you can retain the fleet, disable auto-scaling, and manually scale the fleet to 0 instances.
Note
If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need to request authorization by calling CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization. You do not need to explicitly delete the VPC peering connection--this is done as part of the delete fleet process. 
You can use either the Amazon GameLift console or the AWS CLI tool to delete a fleet. 

[ GameLift Console ]
To delete a fleet


Open the Amazon GameLift console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/.


Choose Fleets from the menu bar to view a list of fleets, and click on the name of the fleet you want to delete. Only fleets in ACTIVE or ERROR status can be deleted.


On the Fleet detail page for your selected fleet, verify that the fleet has zero active instances. If the fleet still has instances, go to the Scaling tab and do the following: 
    Check the box Disable all scaling policies for the fleet. This action stops all auto-scaling, which would counteract your manual scaling settings.
    Manually adjust the desired instance count to "0".


It may take several minutes for the fleet to scale down. If any instances have active game sessions with game session protection, you'll need to either wait for the game sessions to end, or stop protection for the active game sessions (this can't be done in the Console, see UpdateGameSession).


Once the fleet is scaled down to zero active instances, you can delete the fleet. At the top of the Fleet detail page, under Actions, choose Terminate fleet.


In the Terminate fleet dialog box, confirm the deletion by typing the name of the fleet.


Click Delete.



[ AWS CLI ]
To delete a fleet
Get and install the AWS Command Line Interface tool.


In a command line window, call describe-fleet-capacity and verify that the fleet to be deleted has been scaled down to zero active instances. If the fleet still has active instances:


call stop-fleet-actions to disable auto-scaling. 


Call update-fleet-capacity and set the parameter desired-instances to "0". 


Wait for the fleet to scale down to zero active instances. This may take several minutes. If any instances have active game sessions with game session protection, you'll need to either wait for the game sessions to end, or stop protection for the active game sessions (see update-game-session).


Once the fleet is scaled down, call delete-fleet to delete the fleet.
