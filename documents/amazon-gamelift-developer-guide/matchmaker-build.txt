Setting Up Amazon GameLift FlexMatch Matchmakers
A FlexMatch matchmaker process does the work of building a game match. It manages the pool of matchmaking requests received, forms teams for a match, processes and selects players to find the best possible player groups, and initiates the process of placing and starting a game session for the match. This topic describes the key aspects of a matchmaker and how to configure one customized for your game. 
For a detailed description of how a FlexMatch matchmaker processes the matchmaking requests it receives, see Matchmaking Process.
