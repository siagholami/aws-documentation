Amazon GameLift Service API Reference (AWS SDK)
The Amazon GameLift Service API is packaged into the AWS SDK. Download the AWS SDK or view the Amazon GameLift API reference documentation. 
This page lists the available API actions based on functionality and tasks. The GameLift service API includes two main categories: (1) actions for starting game sessions and getting players into games, and (2) actions to manage your GameLift hosting resources.
Actions to Manage Games and Players
Call these API actions from your game client service to start new game sessions, request matchmaking, reserve player slots in active games, and work with game and player session data.
 Start new game sessions for one or more players. Use a game session placement to start a new game and place it with the best hosting resources available. Alternatively, create a new game session on one specific fleet.

   StopGameSessionPlacement – Cancel a placement request. 
   CreateGameSession – Start a new game session on a specific fleet. Available in GameLift Local. 
 Get players into game sessions with FlexMatch matchmaking. Group players into a match and start a new game session for them. Find new players for an existing game using match backfill.
   StartMatchmaking – Request matchmaking for one players or a group who want to play together. 
   DescribeMatchmaking – Get details on a matchmaking request, including status.
   AcceptMatch – For a match that requires player acceptance, register when a player accepts a proposed match.

Actions to Manage Game Hosting Resources
Use these API actions to configure hosting resources for your game, scale capacity to meet player demand, access performance and utilization metrics, and more. Most resource management functionality is available in the GameLift Console, but you can also make direct calls to the service using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) tool or the AWS SDK.
 Manage game builds. Work with builds of your custom game server, which are uploaded to the GameLift service and deployed on fleets.
