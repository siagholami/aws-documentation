IAM Policy Examples for Amazon GameLift
You can use the following examples to create policies and add the appropriate permissions to your IAM users or user groups.
Simple Policy for Administrators
This policy provides full administrative access to a user. Attach it to a user or user group to permit all Amazon GameLift actions on all Amazon GameLift resources (fleets, aliases, game sessions, player sessions, etc.).

"Statement":
  { 
    "Effect": "Allow", 
    "Action": "gamelift:*", 
    "Resource": "*" 
  }
}
Simple Policy for Players
This policy enables access only to functionality needed by players who are using a game client to connect to an Amazon GameLift-hosted game server. This policy allows a user to get game session information, create new game sessions, and join a game session.

    "Action": [ "gamelift:CreateGameSession", "gamelift:DescribeGameSessions", "gamelift:SearchGameSessions", "gamelift:CreatePlayerSession" ],
