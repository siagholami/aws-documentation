Configuring SSO to ADFS and AWS Management Portal for vCenter
You can configure single sign-on (SSO) between ADFS and the management portal. When a user requests access to AWS through the management portal, ADFS authenticates the user.
Note
If you have already set up a trust relationship with AWS, edit the NameId claim to match the configuration in step 11 (the incoming claim type is Windows account name, the outgoing claim type is Name Id, and Persistent Identifier is the outgoing name ID format). Then, continue with step 15.
To configure trust between AWS and ADFS

[ADFS 2.0] From the Start menu, open AD FS 2.0 Management.

[ADFS 3.0] From Server Manager, click Tools, and then select AD FS Management.

[ADFS 2.0] In the Actions pane, click Add Relying Party Trust.

[ADFS 3.0] Under AD FS\Trust Relationships, right-click Relying Party Trusts and then click Add Relying Party Trust.


On the Welcome page, click Start.


On the Select Data Source page, select Import data about the relying party published online or on a local network. Enter "https://signin.aws.amazon.com/static/saml-metadata.xml" as the federation metadata address, and then click Next.



On the Specify Display Name page, enter "AWS Management Portal for vCenter" as the display name, and then click Next.



On the Choose Issuance Authorization Rules page, select Permit all users to access this relying party, and then click Next.


On the Ready to Add Trust page, review your settings, and then click Next.


On the Finish page, select Open the Edit Claim Rules dialog for this relying party trust when the wizard closes, and then click Close.


In the Edit Claim Rules for AWS Management Portal for vCenter dialog box, on the Issuance Transform Rules tab, click Add Rule.


On the Select Rule Template page, select the Send Claims Using a Custom Role claim rule template from the list, and then click Next.


To configure the claim rule, enter NameId in Claim rule name, enter the following rule in Custom claim rule, and then click Finish.


c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname"] => 
   issue(Type = "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier", 
   Issuer = c.Issuer, OriginalIssuer = c.OriginalIssuer, Value = c.Value, ValueType = c.ValueType, 
   Properties["http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claimproperties/format"] = 
   "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent");
Use the Windows user name (domain\user) as the NameId claim. Ensure that these names are less than 32 characters long and are persistent identifiers.



Click Add Rule.


Select Send Claims Using a Custom Role, and then click Next.


To configure the claim rule, enter RoleSessionName in Claim rule name, enter the following rule in Custom claim rule, and then click Finish.


c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname", Issuer == "AD AUTHORITY"] 
   => issue(store = "Active Directory", types = ("https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/RoleSessionName"), 
   query = ";mail;{0}", param = c.Value);
Use the display name for the user with the SAML assertion. These names must be less than 32 characters long and contain only the following set of characters: [a-zA-Z_0-9=,.@-].
The user must have an email address set up in Active Directory.


Click Add Rule.


Select Send Claims Using a Custom Role, and then click Next.


To configure the claim rule, enter AmpRole in Claim rule name, enter the following rule in Custom claim rule, and then click Finish.


=> issue(Type="https://aws.amazon.com/SAML/Attributes/Role", Value = 
   "arn:aws:iam::account_id:saml-provider/provider_name,arn:aws:iam::account_id:role/saml_role");
This rule requires the ARNs of the SAML provider (arn:aws:iam::account_id:saml-provider/provider_name) and the SAML role (arn:aws:iam::account_id:role/saml_role). You can look up these ARNs using the AWS Management Portal for vCenter setup console.

Start and stop the ADFS service and test this configuration. AWS trusts the users authorized by the IdP to assume the SAML role. Therefore, be sure that your IdP authenticates and authorizes a user in your network before granting an assertion.
