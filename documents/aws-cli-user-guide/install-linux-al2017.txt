Prerequisites
You must have Python 2 version 2.7 or later, or Python 3 version 3.4 or later installed. For installation instructions, see the Downloading Python page in Python's Beginner Guide.
Important
AWS CLI version 1 no longer supports Python versions 2.6 and 3.3. All versions of the AWS CLI version 1 released after January 10th, 2020, starting with 1.17, require Python 2.7, Python 3.4, or a later version.
This change does not affect the Windows MSI installer version of the AWS CLI version 1 and the AWS CLI version 2.
For more information, see Using the AWS CLI version 1 with earlier versions of Python in this guide, and the deprecation announcement blog post.
Install or update the AWS CLI version 1 on Amazon Linux using pip
To install the latest version of the AWS CLI version 1 for the current user, use the following instructions.

We recommend that if you have Python version 3 or later installed that you use pip3. Use pip3 install to install or update to the latest version of the AWS CLI version 1. If you run the command from within a Python virtual environment (venv), you don't need to use the --user option. 

$ pip3 install --upgrade --user awscli


Ensure the folder that contains aws is part of your PATH variable.


Find your shell's profile script in your user directory. If you're not sure which shell you have, run echo $SHELL.
$ ls -a ~
  .  ..  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  Desktop  Documents  Downloads
   Bash – .bash_profile, .profile, or .bash_login
   Zsh – .zshrc
   Tcsh – .tcshrc, .cshrc or .login


Add an export command at the end of your profile script that's similar to the following example.
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
This command inserts the path, $HOME/.local/bin in this example, at the front of the existing $PATHvariable.


Reload the profile into your current session to put those changes into effect.
$ source ~/.bash_profile


To verify that you're running the new version, use the aws --version command.


$ aws --version
   aws-cli/1.18.134 Python/3.7.4 Linux/4.14.133-113.105.amzn2.x86_64 botocore/1.13
Uninstall the AWS CLI version 1 using pip
If you need to uninstall the AWS CLI, use pip uninstall.
