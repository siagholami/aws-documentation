Deleting your account
If you delete your AWS account in the AWS Management Console, your Amazon Chime accounts are automatically deleted. Alternatively, you can use the Amazon Chime console to delete an Amazon Chime Team or Enterprise account. 
Note
Users who aren't managed on a Team or Enterprise account can request to be deleted using the Amazon Chime Assistant "Delete me" command. For more information, see Using the Amazon Chime Assistant.
To delete a Team account


Open the Amazon Chime console at https://chime.aws.amazon.com/.


Select the account in the Account name column and select Account under Settings.


In the navigation pane, the Users page is displayed.


Select the users and choose User actions, Remove user.


In the navigation pane, choose Accounts, Account actions, and Delete account.


Confirm that you want to delete your account.


Amazon Chime deletes all user data when you delete your account. This includes termination of an AWS account, individual Amazon Chime accounts, or unmanaged Amazon Chime users. This excludes non-content data related to user accounts and Amazon Chime usage (Service Attributes covered under the Customer Agreement) that is generated by Amazon Chime.
To delete an Enterprise account


Remove the domains.
Note
When you remove a domain, the following occurs:
Users associated with the domain are immediately signed out of all devices and lose access to all contacts, chat conversations, and chat rooms.
Meetings scheduled by users from this domain no longer start.
Suspended users continue to be displayed as Suspended status on the Users and User detail pages and can't access their data. They can't create new Amazon Chime accounts with their email address.
Registered users are displayed as Released on the Users and User detail pages and can't access their data. They can create a new Amazon Chime account with their email address.
If you have an Active Directory account, and you remove a domain that is associated with a user’s primary email address, the user can't access Amazon Chime and their profile is deleted. If you remove a domain that is associated with a user’s secondary email address, they can't log in with that email address, but they retain access to their Amazon Chime contacts and data. 
If you have an Enterprise OpenID Connect (OIDC) account, and you remove a domain that is associated with a user’s primary email address, the user can no longer access Amazon Chime and their profile is deleted.
