Managing user phone numbers
You can use the Amazon Chime console to manage phone numbers for your Amazon Chime administrative account. For more information, see Managing phone numbers in Amazon Chime.
The following tasks describe how to assign phone numbers to users, unassign phone numbers from users, and change calling and SMS permissions for users from the user profiles in your Amazon Chime administrative account.
Note
When you change a user's Amazon Chime Business Calling phone number or phone number permissions, we recommend contacting the user with their new phone number or permissions information. Users must also sign out of their Amazon Chime account and sign back in again before they can access their new phone number or permissions features.
