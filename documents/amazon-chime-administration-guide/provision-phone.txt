To provision phone numbers


Open the Amazon Chime console at https://chime.aws.amazon.com/.


For Calling, choose Phone number management.


Choose Orders, Provision phone numbers.


Select Business Calling or Voice Connector, and choose Next.


Search for available phone numbers by country and other location options. Select the phone numbers that you want, then choose Provision.


The phone numbers display in your Orders and Pending lists while the provisioning occurs. When provisioning is complete, the phone numbers then appear in your Inventory. You can now assign the numbers to individual users. After you create Amazon Chime Voice Connectors, you can assign phone numbers to them as well.
