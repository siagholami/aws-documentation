Managing Amazon Chime Voice Connector groups
How an Amazon Chime Voice Connector group works
You can create an Amazon Chime Voice Connector group and add Amazon Chime Voice Connectors to it that are created in different AWS Regions. This allows incoming calls to fail over across Regions, which creates a fault-tolerant mechanism for fallback in case of availability events.
For example, an Amazon Chime Voice Connector group is created with two Amazon Chime Voice Connectors assigned to it. One Amazon Chime Voice Connector is in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, and the other Amazon Chime Voice Connector is in the US West (Oregon) Region.
An incoming call is placed to a phone number associated with the Amazon Chime Voice Connector in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. However, there is a connectivity issue in that Region, so the call is then routed through the US West (Oregon) Region.
Get started with an Amazon Chime Voice Connector group
To get started, first create Amazon Chime Voice Connectors in different AWS Regions. Then, create an Amazon Chime Voice Connector group and assign the Amazon Chime Voice Connectors to it. You can also provision phone numbers for your Amazon Chime Voice Connector group from your Amazon Chime Phone number management inventory. For more information, see Provisioning phone numbers.
