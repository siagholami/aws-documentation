Using roles to stream Amazon Chime Voice Connector media to Kinesis
Amazon Chime uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Amazon Chime. Service-linked roles are predefined by Amazon Chime and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. 
A service-linked role makes setting up Amazon Chime more efficient because you aren't required to manually add the necessary permissions. Amazon Chime defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only Amazon Chime can assume its roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy. The permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.
You can delete a service-linked role only after first deleting their related resources. This protects your Amazon Chime resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission to access the resources.
For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS services that work with IAM. Look for the services that have Yes in the Service-Linked Role column. Choose a Yes with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.
Service-linked role permissions for Amazon Chime Voice Connectors
Amazon Chime Voice Connectors use the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForAmazonChimeVoiceConnector – Allows Amazon Chime Voice Connectors to call AWS services on your behalf. For more information about how to start media streaming for your Amazon Chime Voice Connector, see Streaming Amazon Chime Voice Connector media to Kinesis.
The AWSServiceRoleForAmazonChimeVoiceConnector service-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:
 voiceconnector.chime.amazonaws.com
The role permissions policy allows Amazon Chime to complete the following actions on the specified resources:
 Action: chime:GetVoiceConnector* on all AWS resources
 Action: kinesisvideo:* on arn:aws:kinesisvideo:us-east-1:111122223333:stream/ChimeVoiceConnector-*
You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see Service-Linked Role Permissions in the IAM User Guide.
Creating a service-linked role for Amazon Chime Voice Connectors
You don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you start Kinesis media streaming for your Amazon Chime Voice Connector in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API, Amazon Chime creates the service-linked role for you. 
You can also use the IAM console to create a service-linked role with the Chime Voice Connector use case. In the AWS CLI or the AWS API, create a service-linked role with the voiceconnector.chime.amazonaws.com service name. For more information, see Creating a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide. If you delete this service-linked role, you can use this same process to create the role again.
Editing a service-linked role for Amazon Chime Voice Connectors
Amazon Chime does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonChimeVoiceConnector service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a service-linked role in the IAM User Guide.
Deleting a service-linked role for Amazon Chime Voice Connectors
If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role. That way you don’t have an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained. However, you must clean up your service-linked role before you can manually delete it.
Cleaning up a service-linked role
Before you can use IAM to delete a service-linked role, you must first delete any resources used by the role.
Note
If the Amazon Chime service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.
