# Managing user permissions and access<a name="manage-access"></a>

Manage which features your Amazon Chime users can access by assigning them Pro or Basic permissions\. Users with Basic permissions cannot host meetings, but they can attend meetings and use chat\. For more information about the features that users with Pro and Basic permissions can access, see [Plans and pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/pricing)\.

Manage who can sign into your Amazon Chime administrative account by inviting or suspending users\. Only Enterprise account administrators can suspend users\. Team account administrators can remove users from their accounts so that they are no longer paying for the userâ€™s permissions\. However, they can't suspend the user to prevent them from signing in\. For more information about the differences between Enterprise and Team accounts, see [Managing your Amazon Chime accounts](manage-chime-account.md)\.

As an Amazon Chime administrator, you can manage Pro and Basic permissions for the users in your Amazon Chime account\.

If Active Directory or Okta is configured for your Amazon Chime account, manage user permissions through their directory group membership\. If you do not have Active Directory or Okta configured, manage user permissions from the Amazon Chime console\.

### Team accounts and Enterprise Login with Amazon<a name="manage-team-lwa-permissions"></a>

To assign Pro permissions to a user, make them a member of an Active Directory or Okta group that you have assigned Pro permissions to\.

Users who don't have either Pro or Basic permissions aren't able to sign into Amazon Chime\.

**To invite users to an Enterprise account**
+ Send an invitation email to the users in your organization and instruct them to follow the steps in [Creating an Amazon Chime account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ug/chime-create-account.html) in the *Amazon Chime User Guide*\.
