# Changing personal meeting PINs<a name="change-PINs"></a>

A personal meeting PIN is a static ID generated when the user registers\. The PIN makes it easy for an Amazon Chime user to schedule meetings with other Amazon Chime users\. Using a personal meeting PIN means that meeting organizers don't have to remember meeting details for each new meeting that they schedule\.

If a user feels that their personal meeting PIN has been compromised, you can reset their PIN and generate a new ID\. After you update a personal meeting PIN, the user must update all meetings that were scheduled using the old personal meeting PIN\.
