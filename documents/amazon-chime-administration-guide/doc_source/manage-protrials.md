# Managing Pro trials<a name="manage-protrials"></a>

When a user accepts an Amazon Chime Team invitation or is added to an Enterprise account, their free trial ends and they have Pro permissions\. This enables them to continue to host meetings that are scheduled\. Changing a user’s permission tier to Basic prevents them from acting as a meeting host\. 

With Amazon Chime usage\-based pricing, you only pay for users that host meetings on the days that they host them\. Meeting attendees and chat users are not charged\. 

Pro users are considered Active Pro if they hosted a meeting that ended on a calendar day and at least one of the following occurred: 
+ The meeting was scheduled\.
+ The meeting included more than two attendees\.
+ The meeting had at least one recording event\.
+ The meeting included an attendee that dialed in\.
+ The meeting included an attendee that joined with H\.323 or SIP\.
