# Deploying the Amazon Chime Add\-In for Outlook<a name="deploy-addin"></a>

Amazon Chime provides two add\-ins for Microsoft Outlook: the Amazon Chime Add\-In for Outlook on Windows and the Amazon Chime Add\-In for Outlook\. These add\-ins offer the same scheduling features, but support different types of users\. Microsoft Office 365 subscribers and organizations using on\-premises Microsoft Exchange 2013 or later can use the Amazon Chime Add\-In for Outlook\. Windows users with an on\-premises Exchange server running Exchange Server 2010 or earlier and Outlook 2010 users must use the Amazon Chime Add\-in for Outlook on Windows\.

Windows users who do not have permissions to install the Amazon Chime Add\-in for Outlook should opt for the Amazon Chime Add\-in for Outlook on Windows\. 

For information about which add\-in is right for you and your organization, see [Choosing the Right Outlook Add\-In](https://answers.chime.aws/articles/663/choosing-the-right-outlook-add-in.html)\.

If you choose the Amazon Chime Add\-In for Outlook for your organization, you can deploy it to your users with centralized deployment\.
