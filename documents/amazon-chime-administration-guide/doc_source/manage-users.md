In the Amazon Chime console, under **Users**, you can view a list of all the users in your account and see their user details\. For more information, see [Viewing user details](user-details.md)\.

Administrators of accounts using **Login with Amazon** \(LWA\) also see options to manage permission tiers and remove users from the account\. These actions are managed through Active Directory for accounts where Active Directory is configured and Okta for accounts where Okta is configured\. For more information, see [Managing user permissions and access](manage-access.md)\.
