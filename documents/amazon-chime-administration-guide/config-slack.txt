Associate your workspace with an Amazon Chime Team account to manage your users' permissions. You can upgrade meeting hosts to Amazon Chime Pro so that they can start meetings with up to 250 attendees and 16 video tiles, and include phone numbers to dial in for audio. Assign users Amazon Chime Basic permissions so they can start one-on-one meetings or join Amazon Chime meetings without being charged for active host days.
