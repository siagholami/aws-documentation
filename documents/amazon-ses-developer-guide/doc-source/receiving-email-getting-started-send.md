# Step 4: Send a test email<a name="receiving-email-getting-started-send"></a>

Now that you've verified and configured your domain, you can send an email to test your domain's ability to receive email\.

To send a test email, use an email account that you know is capable of sending email, such as your personal email address\. Send a test message to any email address on your verified domain\. For example, if your domain is *example\.com*, you can send an email to *test@example\.com* or *abc123@example\.com* \(or any other address on the *example\.com* domain\)\.

**Note**  
You don't need to complete any additional steps to create individual email addresses on your domainâ€”Amazon SES receives every email that is sent to any address on the verified domain, and applies the receipt rule you created in [Step 3: Set up a receipt rule](receiving-email-getting-started-receipt-rule.md)\.
