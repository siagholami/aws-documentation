# Contents of event data that Amazon SES publishes to Kinesis Data Firehose<a name="event-publishing-retrieving-firehose-contents"></a>

Amazon SES publishes email sending event records to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose in JSON format\. When publishing events to Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon SES follows each JSON record with a newline character\.

The top\-level JSON object contains an `eventType` string, a `mail` object, and either a `Bounce`, `Complaint`, `Delivery`, `Send`, `Reject`, `Open`, `Click`, `Rendering Failure`, or `DeliveryDelay` object, depending on the type of event\.

You can find example records for all of these notification types in [Examples of event data that Amazon SES publishes to Kinesis Data Firehose](event-publishing-retrieving-firehose-examples.md)\.

## Top\-level JSON object<a name="event-publishing-retrieving-firehose-contents-top-level-json-object"></a>

## Mail object<a name="event-publishing-retrieving-firehose-contents-mail-object"></a>

Each email sending event record contains information about the original email in the `mail` object\. The JSON object that contains information about a `mail` object has the following fields\.


| Field Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `timestamp`  |  The date and time, in ISO8601 format \(*YYYY\-MM\-DDThh:mm:ss\.sZ*\), when the message was sent\.  | 
|  `messageId`  |  A unique ID that Amazon SES assigned to the message\. Amazon SES returned this value to you when you sent the message\.  This message ID was assigned by Amazon SES\. You can find the message ID of the original email in the `headers` and `commonHeaders` fields of the `mail` object\.   | 
|  `source`  |  The email address that the message was sent from \(the envelope MAIL FROM address\)\.  | 
|  `sourceArn`  |  The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the identity that was used to send the email\. In the case of sending authorization, the `sourceArn` is the ARN of the identity that the identity owner authorized the delegate sender to use to send the email\. For more information about sending authorization, see [Using sending authorization](sending-authorization.md)\.  | 
|  `sendingAccountId`  |  The AWS account ID of the account that was used to send the email\. In the case of sending authorization, the `sendingAccountId` is the delegate sender's account ID\.  |

|  `headers`  |  A list of the email's original headers\. Each header in the list has a `name` field and a `value` field\.  Any message ID within the `headers` field is from the original message that you passed to Amazon SES\. The message ID that Amazon SES subsequently assigned to the message is in the `messageId` field of the `mail` object\.   |

## Bounce object<a name="event-publishing-retrieving-firehose-contents-bounce-object"></a>

The JSON object that contains information about a `Bounce` event will always have the following fields\.

### Bounced recipients<a name="event-publishing-retrieving-firehose-contents-bounced-recipients"></a>

A bounce event may pertain to a single recipient or to multiple recipients\. The `bouncedRecipients` field holds a list of objects—one object per recipient to whom the bounce event pertains—and will always contain the following field\.


| Field Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `emailAddress`  |  The email address of the recipient\. If a DSN is available, this is the value of the `Final-Recipient` field from the DSN\.  |

|  `status`  |  The value of the `Status` field from the DSN\. This is the per\-recipient transport\-independent status code that indicates the delivery status of the message\.  | 
|  `diagnosticCode`  |  The status code issued by the reporting MTA\. This is the value of the `Diagnostic-Code` field from the DSN\. This field may be absent in the DSN \(and therefore also absent in the JSON\)\.  | 

### Bounce types<a name="event-publishing-retrieving-firehose-contents-bounce-types"></a>

Each bounce event will be of one of the types shown in the following table\.

The event publishing system only publishes hard bounces and soft bounces that will no longer be retried by Amazon SES\. When you receive bounces marked `Permanent`, you should remove the corresponding email addresses from your mailing list; you will not be able to send to them in the future\. `Transient` bounces are sent to you when a message has soft bounced several times, and Amazon SES has stopped trying to re\-deliver it\. You may be able to successfully resend to an address that initially resulted in a `Transient` bounce in the future\.


| bounceType | bounceSubType | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `Undetermined`  |  `Undetermined`  |  Amazon SES was unable to determine a specific bounce reason\.  | 
|  `Permanent`  |  `General`  |  Amazon SES received a general hard bounce\. If you receive this type of bounce, you should remove the recipient's email address from your mailing list\.  | 
|  `Permanent`  |  `NoEmail`  |  Amazon SES received a permanent hard bounce because the target email address does not exist\. If you receive this type of bounce, you should remove the recipient's email address from your mailing list\.  | 
|  `Permanent`  |  `Suppressed`  |  Amazon SES has suppressed sending to this address because it has a recent history of bouncing as an invalid address\. For information about how to remove an address from the suppression list, see [Using the Amazon SES global suppression list](sending-email-global-suppression-list.md)\.  | 
| Permanent | OnAccountSuppressionList | Amazon SES has suppressed sending to this address because it is on the [account\-level suppression list](sending-email-suppression-list.md)\. | 
|  `Transient`  |  `General`  |  Amazon SES received a general bounce\. You may be able to successfully send to this recipient in the future\.  | 
|  `Transient`  |  `MailboxFull`  |  Amazon SES received a mailbox full bounce\. You may be able to successfully send to this recipient in the future\.  | 
|  `Transient`  |  `MessageTooLarge`  |  Amazon SES received a message too large bounce\. You may be able to successfully send to this recipient if you reduce the size of the message\.  | 
|  `Transient`  |  `ContentRejected`  |  Amazon SES received a content rejected bounce\. You may be able to successfully send to this recipient if you change the content of the message\.  | 
|  `Transient`  |  `AttachmentRejected`  |  Amazon SES received an attachment rejected bounce\. You may be able to successfully send to this recipient if you remove or change the attachment\.  |

### Complained recipients<a name="event-publishing-retrieving-firehose-contents-complained-recipients"></a>

The `complainedRecipients` field contains a list of recipients that may have submitted the complaint\. 

**Important**  
Since most ISPs redact the email address of the recipient who submitted the complaint from their complaint notification, this list contains information about recipients who might have sent the complaint, based on the recipients of the original message and the ISP from which we received the complaint\. Amazon SES performs a lookup against the original message to determine this recipient list\.

JSON objects in this list contain the following field\.


| Field Name | Description |
