# Getting your AWS access keys<a name="get-aws-keys"></a>

After you've signed up for Amazon SES, you'll need to obtain your AWS access keys if you want to access Amazon SES through the Amazon SES API, whether by the Query \(HTTPS\) interface directly or indirectly through an [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/), the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), or the [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/)\. AWS access keys consist of an access key ID and a secret access key\.

For more information about the types of security keys that you can use in Amazon SES, see [Types of Amazon SES credentials](send-email-concepts-credentials.md)\. For information about obtaining AWS access keys, see [AWS security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.
