# Increasing your Amazon SES sending quotas<a name="manage-sending-quotas-request-increase"></a>

When your account is out of the sandbox and you're sending high\-quality production email, we might automatically increase the sending quotas for your account\. Often, we automatically increase these quotas before you actually need them to be increased\.

To qualify for automatic rate increases, all of the following statements have to be true:
+ **You send high\-quality content that your recipients want to receive** –Send content that recipients want and expect\. Stop sending email to customers who don't open your email\.
+ **You send actual production content** – Sending test messages to fake email addresses can have a negative effect on your bounce and complaint rates\. Also, sending messages only to internal recipients makes it difficult to determine if you're sending content that customers want to receive\. However, when you send your production messages to non\-internal recipients, we can accurately assess your email\-sending practices\.
+ **You send near your current quota** – To qualify for an automatic quota increase, your daily email volume should regularly approach the daily maximum for your account without exceeding it\.
+ **You have low bounce and complaint rates** – Minimize the number of bounces and complaints that you receive\. Having a high number of bounces and complaints can have a negative impact on your sending quotas\.

If your current sending quotas aren't adequate for your needs and we haven't automatically increased them, you can request an increase\.
