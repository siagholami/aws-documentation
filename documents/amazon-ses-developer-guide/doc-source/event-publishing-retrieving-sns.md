# Interpreting Amazon SES event data from Amazon SNS<a name="event-publishing-retrieving-sns"></a>

Amazon SES publishes email sending events to Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) as JSON records\. Amazon SNS then delivers notifications to the endpoints that are subscribed to the Amazon SNS topic associated with the event destination\. For information about setting up topics and subscriptions in Amazon SNS, see [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/GettingStarted.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*\.

For a description of the record contents and for example records, see the following sections\.
