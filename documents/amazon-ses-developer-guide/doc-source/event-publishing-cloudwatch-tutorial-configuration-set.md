# Step 1: Set up a Configuration Set<a name="event-publishing-cloudwatch-tutorial-configuration-set"></a>

To set up Amazon SES to publish your email sending events to Amazon CloudWatch, you first create a configuration set, and then you add a CloudWatch event destination to the configuration set\. This section shows how to accomplish those tasks\.

If you already have a configuration set, you can add a CloudWatch destination to your existing configuration set\. In this case, skip to [Adding a CloudWatch Event Destination](#event-publishing-cloudwatch-tutorial-configuration-set-add-destination)\.

Amazon SES sends the selected metrics to CloudWatch if the email contains this key\-value pair as a message tag\. When you view the metrics in CloudWatch, they're categorized by the key of the message tag\.

If you choose **Link Tag** as the value source, you can only send click events to CloudWatch\. You can use the **Link Tag** value source to determine which links in your emails are clicked most often\.

1. Choose **Save**\.
