# Integrating Amazon SES with Microsoft Windows Server IIS SMTP<a name="send-email-windows-server"></a>

You can configure Microsoft Windows Server's IIS SMTP server to send email through Amazon SES\. These instructions were written using Microsoft Windows Server 2012 on an Amazon EC2 instance\. You can use the same configuration on Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2\.

**Note**  
Windows Server is a third\-party application, and isn't developed or supported by Amazon Web Services\. The procedures in this section are provided for informational purposes only, and are subject to change without notice\.

**To integrate the Microsoft Windows Server IIS SMTP server with Amazon SES**

1. First, set up Microsoft Windows Server 2012 using the following instructions\.

   1. From the [Amazon EC2 management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home), launch a new Microsoft Windows Server 2012 Base Amazon EC2 instance\.

   1. Connect to the instance and log into it using Remote Desktop by following the instructions in [Getting Started with Amazon EC2 Windows Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/EC2Win_GetStarted.html)\.

   1. Launch the Server Manager Dashboard\.

   1. Install the **Web Server** role\. Be sure to include the **IIS 6 Management Compatibility tools** \(an option under the **Web Server** checkbox\)\.

   1. Install the **SMTP Server** feature\.

1. Next, configure the IIS SMTP service using the following instructions\.

   1. Return to the Server Manager Dashboard\.

   1. From the **Tools** menu, choose **Internet Information Services \(IIS\) 6\.0 Manager**\.

   1. Right\-click **SMTP Virtual Server \#1** and then select **Properties**\.

   1. On the **Access** tab, under **Relay Restrictions**, choose **Relay**\.

   1. In the **Relay Restrictions** dialog box, choose **Add**\.

   1. Under **Single Computer**, enter **127\.0\.0\.1** for the IP address\. You have now granted access for this server to relay email to Amazon SES through the IIS SMTP service\.

      In this procedure, we assume that your emails are generated on this server\. If the application that generates the email runs on a separate server, you need to grant relaying access for that server in IIS SMTP\.
**Note**  
To extend the SMTP relay to private subnets, for **Relay Restriction**, use **Single Computer** 127\.0\.0\.1 and **Group of Computers** 172\.1\.1\.0 \- 255\.255\.255\.0 \(in the netmask section\)\. For **Connection**, use **Single Computer** 127\.0\.0\.1 and **Group of Computers** 172\.1\.1\.0 \- 255\.255\.255\.0 \(in the netmask section\)\.

1. Finally, configure the server to send email through Amazon SES using the following instructions\.

   1. Return to the **SMTP Virtual Server \#1 Properties** dialog box and then choose the **Delivery** tab\.

   1. On the **Delivery** tab, choose **Outbound Security**\.

   1. Select **Basic Authentication** and then enter your Amazon SES SMTP username and password\. You can obtain these credentials from the Amazon SES console using the procedure in [Obtaining your Amazon SES SMTP credentials](smtp-credentials.md)\.
**Important**  
Your SMTP user name and password are not the same as your AWS access key ID and secret access key\. Do not attempt to use your AWS credentials to authenticate yourself against the SMTP endpoint\. For more information about credentials, see [Types of Amazon SES credentials](send-email-concepts-credentials.md)\.

   1. Ensure that **TLS encryption** is selected\.

   1. Return to the **Delivery** tab\.

   1. Choose **Outbound Connections**\.

   1. In the **Outbound Connections** dialog box, ensure that the port is 25 or 587\. 

   1. Choose **Advanced**\.

   1. For the **Smart host** name, enter the Amazon SES endpoint that you will use \(for example, *email\-smtp\.us\-west\-2\.amazonaws\.com*\)\. For a list of endpoint URLs for the AWS Regions where Amazon SES is available, see [Amazon Simple Email Service \(Amazon SES\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ses_region) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

   1. Return to the Server Manager Dashboard\.

   1. On the Server Manager Dashboard, right\-click **SMTP Virtual Server \#1** and then restart the service to pick up the new configuration\.

   1. Send an email through this server\. You can examine the message headers to confirm that it was delivered through Amazon SES\.
