# Sending email through Amazon SES from your application<a name="send-email-smtp-app"></a>

Many programming languages support sending email using SMTP\. This capability might be built into the programming language itself, or it might be available as an add\-on, plug\-in, or library\. You can take advantage of this capability by sending email through Amazon SES from within application programs that you write\.

For examples in C\# and Java, see [Send an email by accessing the Amazon SES SMTP interface programmatically](send-using-smtp-programmatically.md) in the Getting Started section\.
