# Use case examples<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases"></a>

The following examples outline some rules that you might set up to use Lambda function outcomes to control your mail flow\. For demonstration purposes, many of these examples use the S3 action as the outcome\.

## Use case 1: Drop spam across all domains<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-1"></a>

This example demonstrates a global rule that drops spam across all of your domains\. Rules 2 and 3 are included to show that you can apply domain\-specific rules after the spam is dropped over all the domains\.

### Rule 1<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-1-rule-1"></a>

*Recipient list: *Empty\. This rule will therefore apply to all recipients under all of your verified domains\.

 *Actions* 

1. Lambda action \(synchronous\) that returns `STOP_RULE_SET` if the email is spam\. Otherwise, it returns `CONTINUE`\. See the example Lambda function for dropping spam in [Lambda function examples](receiving-email-action-lambda-example-functions.md)\.

### Rule 2<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-1-rule-2"></a>

*Recipient list: *example1\.com

 *Actions* 

1. Any action\.

### Rule 3<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-1-rule-3"></a>

*Recipient list: *example2\.com

 *Actions* 

1. Any action\.

## Use case 2: Bounce spam across all domains<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-2"></a>

This example demonstrates a global rule that bounces spam across all of your domains\. Rules 2 and 3 are included to show that you can apply domain\-specific rules after the spam is bounced over all the domains\.

### Rule 1<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-2-rule-1"></a>

*Recipient list: *Empty\. This rule will therefore apply to all recipients under all of your verified domains\.

 *Actions* 

1. Lambda action \(synchronous\) that returns `CONTINUE` if the email is spam\. Otherwise, it returns `STOP_RULE`\.

1. Bounce action \("500 5\.6\.1\. Message content rejected"\)\.

1. Stop action\.

### Rule 2<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-2-rule-2"></a>

*Recipient list: *example1\.com

 *Actions* 

1. Any action

### Rule 3<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-2-rule-3"></a>

*Recipient list: *example2\.com

 *Actions* 

1. Any action

## Use case 3: Apply the most specific rule<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-3"></a>

This example demonstrates how you can use the Stop action to prevent emails from being processed by multiple rules\. In this example, you have one rule for a specific address, and another rule for all email addresses under the domain\. By using the Stop action, messages that match the rule for the specific email address are not processed by the more generic rule that applies to the domain\.

### Rule 1<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-3-rule-1"></a>

*Recipient list: *user@example\.com

 *Actions* 

1. Lambda action \(asynchronous\)\.

1. Stop action\.

### Rule 2<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-3-rule-2"></a>

*Recipient list: *example\.com

 *Actions* 

1. Any action\.

## Use case 4: Log mail events to CloudWatch<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-4"></a>

This example demonstrates how to keep an audit log of all mail going through your system before saving the mail to Amazon SES\.

### Rule 1<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-4-rule-1"></a>

*Recipient list: *example\.com

 *Actions* 

1. Lambda action \(asynchronous\) that writes the event object to a CloudWatch log\. The example Lambda functions in [Lambda function examples](receiving-email-action-lambda-example-functions.md) log to CloudWatch\.

1. S3 action\.

## Use case 5: Drops mail that fails DKIM<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-5"></a>

This example demonstrates how you can save all incoming email to an Amazon S3 bucket, but only send email that goes to a specific email address, and passes DKIM, to your automated email application\.

### Rule 1<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-5-rule-1"></a>

*Recipient list: *example\.com

 *Actions* 

1. S3 action\.

1. Lambda action \(synchronous\) that returns `STOP_RULE_SET` if the message fails DKIM\. Otherwise, it returns `CONTINUE`\.

### Rule 2<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-5-rule-2"></a>

*Recipient list: *support@example\.com

 *Actions* 

1. Lambda action \(asynchronous\) that triggers the automated application\.

## Use case 6: Filters mail based on subject line<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-6"></a>

This example demonstrates how you can drop all of a domain's incoming mail that contains the word "discount" in the subject line, and then process mail intended for an automated system one way, and process mail addressed to all other recipients in the domain a different way\.

### Rule 1<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-6-rule-1"></a>

*Recipient list: *example\.com

 *Actions* 

1. Lambda action \(synchronous\) that returns `STOP_RULE_SET` if the subject line contains the word "discount"\. Otherwise, it returns `CONTINUE`\.

### Rule 2<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-6-rule-2"></a>

*Recipient list: *support@example\.com

 *Actions* 

1. S3 action with bucket 1\.

1. Lambda action \(asynchronous\) that triggers the automated application\.

1. Stop action\.

### Rule 3<a name="receiving-email-action-lambda-example-use-cases-6-rule-3"></a>

*Recipient list: *example\.com

 *Actions* 

1. S3 action with bucket 2\.

1. Lambda action \(asynchronous\) that processes email for the rest of the domain\.
