# Prerequisites<a name="event-publishing-cloudwatch-tutorial-prerequisites"></a>

For this tutorial, you will need the following:
+ **An AWS account** – To access any web service that AWS offers, you must first create an AWS account at [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/)\.
+ **Verified email address** – To send emails using Amazon SES, you must verify your "From" address or domain to show that you own it\. If you are in the sandbox, you also must verify your "To" addresses\. You can verify email addresses or entire domains, but this tutorial requires a verified email address so that you can send an email from the Amazon SES console, which is the simplest way to send an email\. For information about how to verify an email address, see [Verifying email addresses in Amazon SES](verify-email-addresses.md)\.
