# Amazon SES notification problems<a name="troubleshoot-notifications"></a>

If you encounter a problem with bounce, complaint, or delivery notifications, review the possible causes and solutions below\.
+ **You receive bounce notifications via Amazon SNS, but you don't know which recipients the notifications correspond to**—In the future, to associate a bounce notification with a given recipient, you have the following options:
  + Since Amazon SES doesn't retain any custom message IDs that you have added, store a mapping between an identifier and the Amazon SES message ID that Amazon SES passes back to you when it accepts the email\.
  + In each call to Amazon SES, send to a single recipient, rather than sending a single message to multiple recipients\.
  + You can enable feedback forwarding via email, which will forward the full bounce message to you\.
+ **You receive complaint notifications via Amazon SNS or email feedback forwarding, but you don't know which recipients the notifications correspond to**—Some ISPs redact the complained recipient's email address before passing the complaint notification to Amazon SES\. To enable you to find the recipient's email address, your best option is to store your own mapping between an identifier and the Amazon SES message ID that Amazon SES passes back to you when it accepts the email\. Note that Amazon SES does not retain any custom message IDs that you add\.
+ **You want to set up notifications to go to an Amazon SNS topic you don't own**—The owner of that topic must configure an Amazon SNS access policy that allows your account to call the `SNS:Publish` action on their topic\. For information about how to control access to your Amazon SNS topic through the use of IAM policies, see [Managing Access to Your Amazon SNS Topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/AccessPolicyLanguage.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*\.
