This getting started tutorial provides step\-by\-step instructions for you to set up Amazon Simple Email Service \(Amazon SES\) and send an email\. First, review the information in [Before you begin with Amazon SES](send-email-getting-started-prerequisites.md)\. Then, send an email in one of the following ways\.

## Using the Amazon SES console<a name="using-the-console-intro"></a>

Use this method if you want to get started sending test emails through Amazon SES with minimal setup\. When you are ready to start your production email sending campaign, use one of the other sending methods and use the Amazon SES console primarily to monitor your sending activity\.

To start this tutorial, go to [Send an email using the Amazon SES console](send-an-email-from-console.md)\.

## Using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol \(SMTP\)<a name="using-smtp-intro"></a>

Use this method if you want to send email through the Amazon SES SMTP interface with or without programming as follows:
+ Enable an application to send email through Amazon SES by using a programming language that supports SMTP\. Examples are provided in C\#, Java, and PHP\. To start this tutorial, go to [Send an email by accessing the Amazon SES SMTP interface programmatically](send-using-smtp-programmatically.md)\.
+ Set up your mail server to forward mail to Amazon SES, or configure your email client or SMTP\-enabled software package to send email through Amazon SES\. Examples are provided for Postfix, Sendmail, and Exim mail servers\. To start this tutorial, go to [Configuring Your Existing Email Server or SMTP\-Enabled Application to Send Email Through Amazon SES](send-using-smtp-integrate.md)\.

For introductory information on both SMTP sending methods, see [Send an email through Amazon SES using SMTP](send-an-email-using-smtp.md)\.
