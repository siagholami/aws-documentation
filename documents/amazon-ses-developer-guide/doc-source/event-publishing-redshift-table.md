# Step 3: Create a Database Table<a name="event-publishing-redshift-table"></a>

After you connect to the initial database in Amazon Redshift, you typically use the initial database as the base for creating a new database\. However, in this simple tutorial, we create a table to hold your Amazon SES event publishing data directly within the initial database\.

For this tutorial, let's assume that we're interested in the following fields within the [email sending event records](event-publishing-retrieving-firehose-contents.md)\. All of these fields, except for `mail.tags.campaign`, are provided automatically by Amazon SES\. We introduce the `mail.tags.campaign` field when we send an email using `campaign` as a message tag in [Step 6: Send Emails](event-publishing-redshift-send-email.md)\.
+ `mail.messageId`
+ `eventType`
+ `mail.sendingAccountId`
+ `mail.timestamp`
+ `mail.destination`
+ `mail.tags.ses:configuration-set`
+ `mail.tags.campaign`

To access this information within your database, you must create a table\. The following procedure shows how to specify this information when you create the table in your database\.

**Note**  
We assume that SQL Workbench/J is currently open on your computer, and it is connected to your Amazon Redshift cluster, as described in [previous step](event-publishing-redshift-cluster-connect.md)\.

**To create a table using SQL Workbench/J**

1. In SQL Workbench/J, copy the following code and paste it into the **Statement 1** window\.

   ```
   create table ses (
       message_id varchar(200) not null,
       event_type varchar(20) not null,
       sending_account_id char(12),
       timestamp varchar(50),
       destination text,
       configuration_set text,
       campaign text
   );
   ```

1. Place the cursor within the statement \(somewhere before the semicolon\), and then choose the **Execute current statement** button, as shown in the following figure\.

1. In the **Messages** pane, verify that your table was successfully created\.
