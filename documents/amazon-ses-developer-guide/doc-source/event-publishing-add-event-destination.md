# Step 2: Add an event destination<a name="event-publishing-add-event-destination"></a>

Event destinations are places that you publish Amazon SES events to\. Each event destination that you set up belongs to one, and only one, configuration set\. When you set up an event destination with Amazon SES, you choose the AWS service destination, and you specify parameters associated with that destination\. 

When you set up an event destination, you can choose to send events to one of the following AWS services: Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, and Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\)\. The event destination that you choose depends on the level of detail you want about the events, and the way you want to receive the event information\. If you simply want a running total of each type of event \(for example, so that you can set an alarm when the total gets too high\), you can use CloudWatch\. If you want detailed event records that you can output to another service such as Amazon Elasticsearch Service or Amazon Redshift for analysis, you can use Kinesis Data Firehose\. If you want to receive notifications when certain events occur, you can use Amazon SNS\.
