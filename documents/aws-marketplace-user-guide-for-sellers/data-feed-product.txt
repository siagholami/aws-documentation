Product data feed
This data feed provides information about all products you've created as the seller of record and all products you're authorized to resell.
Product data is mutable. This means that when you change the value for one of the following fields, a new record is created in the data feed with a different value for valid_from field. For more information about the data feed history columns, see Historization of the data.
