Policies and permissions for AWS Marketplace sellers
AWS Marketplace has three managed policies you can use with AWS Marketplace Management Portal, or a number of permissions that you can use to create your own policy. 
Note
To learn about policies and permissions on AWS Data Exchange for data products, see Identity and Access Management in AWS Data Exchange in the AWS Data Exchange User Guide.

Note
 To enable a user to access the Manage Products page, you must use the AWSMarketplaceSellerProductsFullAccess or AWSMarketplaceSellerProductsReadOnly managed permissions. 
You can combine the preceding permissions into a single IAM policy to grant the permissions that you want. See the following examples.
Example 1: Permissions to access the Marketing and File Upload pages.
To grant permissions to both the Marketing page and the File Upload page, use a policy similar to the following example: 
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "aws-marketplace-management:viewMarketing",
      "aws-marketplace-management:uploadFiles"
    ],
    "Resource": ["*"]
  }]
}
Example 2: Permissions to create upgrades and renewals for private offers
To grant permissions to view and use the Agreements page to create upgrades and renewals for private offers, use a policy similar to the following example:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "aws-marketplace:SearchAgreements",
                "aws-marketplace:DescribeAgreement",
                "aws-marketplace:GetAgreementTerms"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws-marketplace:PartyType": "Proposer"
                },
                "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
                    "aws-marketplace:AgreementType": [
                        "PurchaseAgreement"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
Using IAM groups
Alternatively, you can create separate IAM groups for granting access to each individual page in the AWS Marketplace Management Portal. Users can belong to more than one group. So, if a user needs access to more than one page, you can add the user to all of the appropriate groups. For example, create one IAM group and grant that group permission to access the Marketing page, create another group and grant that group permission to access the File Upload page, and so on. If a user needs permission to access both the Marketing page and the File Upload page, add the user to both groups.
For more information about IAM users and groups, see Identities (Users, Groups, and Roles) in the IAM User Guide.
