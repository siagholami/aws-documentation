# Container\-based products<a name="container-based-products"></a>

AWS Marketplace supports software products that use Docker containers\. Container products consist of fulfillment options which are a set of container images and deployment templates that go together\. You submit at least one fulfillment option for your product, with up to a maximum of four\. For each fulfillment option, you provide a set of container images, usage instructions, and links to deployment templates for customers to launch that fulfillment option\.

AWS Marketplace buyers see the available fulfillment options on the published product detail pages they have visibility to\. Once they subscribe to the product and choose their preferred fulfillment option on the **Configure your product** page, they see links to the available deployment templates, container image URLs, as well as instructions for how to pull the individual container images\.

You can run paid container products on the orchestration services [Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/), [Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/), and [Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html)\. You can run Free and BYOL container products on any Docker\-compatible runtime\.
