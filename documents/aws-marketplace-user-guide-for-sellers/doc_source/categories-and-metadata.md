# Categories and metadata<a name="categories-and-metadata"></a>

Here are best practices and information for supplying product metadata\. AWS Marketplace revises product metadata solely for quality assurance and error correction\.

## Naming and describing your product<a name="naming-and-describing-your-product"></a>

The information that you provide about your product is visible to buyers\. Ensure that potential buyers have enough information to make informed decisions about buying your product\.

### Creating the product name<a name="optimizing-the-product-name-field"></a>

Keep the following guidelines in mind as you create the product name: 
+ Use title case \(capitalize the first letter of each important word\)
+ Ensure that a buyer can identify the product by the name alone
+ Use the name of the brand or manufacturer
+ Avoid descriptive data or hyperbole

Example product name: Smart Solution Load Balancer \- Premium Edition\.

### Writing the product description<a name="writing-the-product-description"></a>

The product description lists the product's features, benefits, and usage\. It can also provide other relevant, specific product information\. The description can be up to 350 characters long\. 

Keep the following guidelines in mind as you write the product description: 
+ Avoid unnecessary capitalization
+ Avoid unnecessary punctuation marks
+ Don't include redirect information
+ Check spelling and grammar
+ Include only critical, useful information

Example product solution: Smart Solution automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances\. It enables you to achieve even greater fault tolerance in your applications, providing the amount of load\-balancing capacity you need to respond to incoming application traffic\. Smart Solution detects unhealthy instances in a pool and automatically reroutes traffic to healthy instances until the unhealthy instances are restored\. You can enable Smart Solution in a single AWS availability zone or across multiple availability zones to ensure more consistent application performance\.

### Writing the product highlights<a name="writing-the-product-highlights"></a>

The product information page displays up to three product highlight bullet points\. Use these bullet points to briefly describe the product's primary selling points\.

Example product highlight: Projecting costs: With Smart Solution, you pay only for what you use\. You're charged for each hour or partial hour that Smart Solution is running\.

### Writing the release notes<a name="writing-the-release-notes"></a>

Each time you update an AMI product, you must provide a description of the changes in the release notes\. The release notes should contain specific information to help the user decide whether to install the update\. Use clear labels for the update, such as "Critical" for a security update or "Important" or "Optional" for other types of updates\.

### Writing the usage instructions<a name="writing-the-usage-instructions"></a>

Provide usage instructions that help ensure that the buyer can successfully configure and run the software\. The usage instructions you provide are shown during the AMI configuration process\.

To write effective usage instructions, follow these guidelines:
+ Write them with a new or moderately technical audfience\.
+ Don't assume that the user has prior experience with or extensive knowledge of the product, computer operating systems, engineering, or IT operations\.
+ Take the buyer from launching to using the product, including any configuration or special steps to get the application running\.

 Example usage insgtructions: 

1. Launch the product via 1\-Click\.

1. Use a web browser to access the application at https://<EC2\_Instance\_Public\_DNS>/index\.html\.

1. Sign in using the following credentials:
   + Username: user
   + Password: the instance\_id of the instance

### Writing the upgrade instructions<a name="writing-upgrade-instructions"></a>

Provide details on how buyer can upgrade from an earlier version of the product\. Include information on how to preserve data and settings when creating another instance\. If there is no upgrade path, edit this field to specifically mention that\. 

Example upgrade instructions:

1. Do \*\*\*\*, and then \*\*\*\*\.

1. Check that all plugins used by your project are compatible with version \*\.\*, by doing \*\*\*\. If they aren't compatible, do \*\*\*\.

1. Make a backup of your data, by doing \*\*\*\.

## Choosing categories and keywords<a name="choosing-categories-and-keywords"></a>

When you list your product, you can choose up to three software categories and corresponding subcategories for your product\. This helps buyers discover your product as they browse or search for products on AWS Marketplace\. Choose only categories that are relevant to your product; in most cases, only one category applies\. The product load form and the **Products** tab both contain a complete list of categories\. 

Categories aren't the same as keywords\. The categories and subcategories available are predefined for AWS Marketplace, and you decide which ones apply to your product by selecting them from a list during the product request process\. Keywords aren't predefined, but are created during the process\. You don't need to add the category as a keyword\. 

### Creating search keywords<a name="creating-search-keywords"></a>

During the product request process, you can enter up to three keywords \(single words or phrases\) to help buyers discover your product through site searches\. The keywords field can contain a maximum of 250 characters\. 

The following tips can help you to create a relevant set of search keywords:
+ Use relevant terms\.
+ Don't use the names of products published by other sellers or use other sellers' names\.
+ Choose keywords from your buyer's vocabularyâ€”that is, words and phrases that buyers are likely to use when thinking about your type of product\.
+ Create keywords based on specific features in your product\.
+ Don't use the product title as a keyword\. The product title is already indexed in searches\.

 **Note**: Keywords aren't the same as software categories\. Keywords are more specific terms that are related to your product\.
