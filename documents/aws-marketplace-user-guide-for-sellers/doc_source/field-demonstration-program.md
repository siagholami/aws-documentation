# AWS Marketplace Field Demonstration Program<a name="field-demonstration-program"></a>

The AWS Marketplace Field Demonstration Program \(FDP\) allows internally approved AWS employees to use some Independent Software Vendor \(ISV\) solutions through AWS Marketplace at no charge\. Examples of approved AWS employees may include solutions architects, and sales and marketing professionals\. The FDP allows these employees to demonstrate product capabilities for education and potential inclusion in customer workloads\.

The FDP includes only products that ISVs contractually agreed to make available at no charge to the AWS field team for educational and demonstration purposes\. The following product types are supported:
+ [Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\)](ami-products.md) 
+ [Containers](container-based-products.md) 
+ [Machine learning algorithms and model packages \(Amazon SageMaker\)](machine-learning-products.md) 
+ [Data sets \(AWS Data Exchange\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/what-is.html)

As an ISV, you're automatically enrolled in this program when you sign up as an AWS Marketplace seller\. To opt out, submit a support request to the [Managed Catalog Operations \(MCO\) team](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/)\.

To view information about product usage under this program, see the [AWS field demonstration usage](monthly-billed-revenue-report.md#section-3-aws-field-demonstration-usage) section of the [Monthly billed revenue report](monthly-billed-revenue-report.md)\.
