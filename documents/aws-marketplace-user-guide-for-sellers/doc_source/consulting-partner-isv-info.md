# ISV setup<a name="consulting-partner-isv-info"></a>

An ISV can extend a one\-time discount price to a consulting partner for the purpose of a specific resale to a designated buyer\. This percentage gets added to the recurring discount to create the total discount off the product price, and becomes the price for a specific transaction\.

The following procedure outlines how ISVs can create an opportunity for a consulting partner\.

**To create an opportunity for a consulting partner**

1. Sign into the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/)\.

1. Choose the **Partners** tab, and then choose **Create opportunity**\.

1. Fill out the partner and product information, including the additional discount on top of the existing contract discount for the consulting partner\.
**Note**  
The information the ISV puts in the **Opportunity name** and **Opportunity description** will be visible to consulting partners in their seller reports\.

Once created, opportunities can't have their dates extended, however an ISV can revoke an opportunity and recreate it at any time\. When an ISV revokes an opportunity, new offers can't make use of that discount\. But any offers already created are unaffected and they retain their opportunity discount\.
