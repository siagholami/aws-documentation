# Refunds<a name="refunds"></a>

 All paid products, regardless of pricing model, must have a stated refund policy for software charges\. The policy must include the terms of the refund as well as a method of contacting the seller to request a refund\. While the details of the refund policy are up to you, we encourage you to offer customers some manner of refund for usage of the product\. You must comply with your posted refund policies\.

## Refund request types<a name="refund-requests"></a>

Customers can request different kinds of refunds for AWS Marketplace products\. If a customer requests a software refund directly from AWS, we instruct them to contact you using your posted support contact information for the product in question\. Refunds of any AWS infrastructure charges are up to the discretion of AWS and are handled independently of software refunds\. 

 If you use the AWS Marketplace Tax Calculation Service, customers might contact you to request a tax\-only refund\. If a customer requests a tax\-only refund, you can, at your discretion, grant either a tax\-only refund or a full software refund plus tax\. 

## Refund approvals<a name="refund-approval"></a>

Most software refunds must be approved by you through the [Refund Request Form](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/support/refund-request), and will be processed and issued upon your direction by AWS\. Special cases where your approval is not needed exist for the following product types:
+ Pro\-rated subscription cancellations
+ Usage\-based pricing
+ Free trials

In these cases you agree that AWS can initiate and process refunds without approval or direction from you\. These kinds of refunds are processed automatically and require no action on your part\. For more information, see the following related topics:
+ [Annual products](pricing.md#annual-products)
+ [Refund policy](#refund-policy)

## Refund process<a name="refund-process"></a>

You can initiate refunds for your product software usage by submitting a [Refund Request Form](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/support/refund-request)\. Once received by the AWS Marketplace Buyer Support Team, a related support case will be created in the [AWS Support Center Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?), with the refund status noted in the subject line\. Refund related support is facilitated directly through these cases\. For more information, see [Accessing AWS Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/getting-started.html#accessing-support)\.

   + The customer’s email address that is associated with their AWS account\. 
   + The customer’s AWS account number of the account used to subscribe to your product\. Remind your customer that if they are the payer of an organization, they need to provide you with the AWS account ID for the linked account subscribed to your product\.

1. An outbound case will be created in the [AWS Support Center Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?) with status information on the refund request\. The subject line will contain one of the following: 
   + **Completed** – The refund was processed and no further action is required\.
   + **Pending** – The refund will be processed once the current billing cycle ends\.
   + **Action Required** – The request could not be processed, and we need additional information from you\. You can respond directly to the support case, however you will also need to submit a new refund request form\.

1. Once a refund is successfully processed, it will reflect on the customer’s account within 24\-48 hours\. However, it can take up to 5 business days for the funds to appear in the customer’s financial account\.

### Refund policy<a name="refund-policy"></a>

The following list outlines the AWS Marketplace refund policy:
+ If you list your software as a free trial product, AWS can issue refunds on your behalf for software charges accruing within seven days of a conversion from a free trial to a paid subscription\. Refunds issued in connection with free trial conversions require no action on your part\. By enabling a free trial on a product, you are agreeing to this policy\. 
+ If you meter the usage of your software using the AWS Marketplace Metering Service, AWS can issue refunds on your behalf for software charges resulting from software metering errors\. If these errors are common across multiple customers, AWS reserves the right to determine an appropriate refund for each customer and apply it directly to each customer\. Refunds issued in connection with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service must be confirmed with the seller once, but does not require the seller to confirm each individual refund\. By using the AWS Marketplace Metering Service with a product, you are agreeing to this policy\. 
+ All refunds for private offers must be authorized by the respective seller before AWS can process them\.
