# Search engine optimization<a name="search-engine-optimization"></a>

The AWS Marketplace website ranks the results of search queries using search\-optimization techniques similar to those used across the industry\. By understanding how AWS Marketplace ranks and returns search results, you can create product details optimized for the AWS Marketplace search engine\. We recommend taking this guidance into consideration when you create your product detail pages\.

## Keywords<a name="keywords"></a>

During the product creation process, you can submit up to three keywords \(single words or phrases\) to help customers discover your product through site searches\. The keywords text box can contain up to 250 characters\. Use the following tips to create search keywords:
+ Use terms that are relevant so that customers can easily find your products\.
+ Choose keywords from your customers' vocabularyâ€”that is, words and phrases that they're likely to use when thinking about your type of product\.
+ Create keywords based on specific features in your product\.
+ Don't include the product title in the terms that you submit\. The product title is already indexed in the search\.

**Note**  
Keywords aren't the same as software categories\. Keywords are more specific terms that are related to your product\.

## Software categories<a name="software-categories"></a>

When you list your product, you can choose up to three software categories and corresponding subcategories for your product\. This helps customers discover your product as they browse or search the products on AWS Marketplace\. Choose only categories that are relevant to your product\. In most cases, only one category applies\. Both the product load form and the **Products** pages contain a complete list of categories\.

**Note**  
Categories aren't the same as keywords\. The available categories and subcategories are predefined for AWS Marketplace\. You decide which of them apply to your product by choosing them from a list\. Keywords aren't predefined, but are created during the process\.

## Highlights section<a name="highlights-section"></a>

The product details page displays up to three product highlights as bullet points\. Customers can search for products by highlights, so include highlights when you create a product\. A highlight should describe the product's primary selling points in brief and informative language\. For example: "Projecting costs: With AnyCompany's Smart Solution, you pay only for what you use\. You're charged for each hour or partial hour that Smart Solution is running\."

## Short description<a name="short-description"></a>

The product description lists the product's features, benefits, and usage instructions, along with other relevant and specific product information\. Keep the following guidelines in mind as you create the product description:
+ Avoid unnecessary capitalization and punctuation marks
+ Don't include redirect information
+ Check spelling and grammar
+ Include only critical and useful information

## Example<a name="example"></a>

AnyCompany's Smart Solution automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances\. It enables you to improve fault tolerance in your applications by seamlessly providing the load balancing capacity that you need to respond to incoming application traffic\. Smart Solution detects unhealthy instances in a pool and automatically reroutes traffic to healthy instances until the unhealthy instances have been restored\. Customers can enable Smart Solution in a single AWS Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones to enable more consistent application performance\.

The AWS Marketplace Managed Catalog Operations team helps redirect queries with similar\-sounding words or words with similar meanings: for example, when customers search for *automobile* when you expect them to search for *car*****\.
