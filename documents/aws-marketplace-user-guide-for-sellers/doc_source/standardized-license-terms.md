# Standardized license terms<a name="standardized-license-terms"></a>

As you go through the process of [preparing your product](product-preparation.md), you need to determine what to include in the end user license agreement \(EULA\) for your product\. You can create and customize your own EULAs, or you can use the standardized license terms that AWS Marketplace offers, which help speed up transactions and simplify procurement\.

AWS Marketplace offers the following options for providing standardized license terms for your product listings:
+ [Standard Contract for AWS Marketplace \(SCMP\)](#standard-contracts) – These license terms are intended to meet the fundamental requirements of buyer and seller\. 

  This option is available to all AWS Marketplace sellers and is accessible to all buyers\.
+ [Enterprise Contract for AWS Marketplace \(ECMP\)](#enterprise-contracts) – These license terms are intended to meet the more stringent requirements of enterprise buyers\. 

  This option is availble for all AWS Marketplace sellers to enroll in, and it's accessible only to enrolled enterprise buyers\. When you enroll as a seller in the ECMP program, you can still offer SCMP to non\-enterprise buyers\.

You are responsible for determining whether these documents meet your specific requirements\. These documents should not be construed as legal advice for any particular facts or circumstances\.

## Standard Contract for AWS Marketplace \(SCMP\)<a name="standard-contracts"></a>

SCMP is a standardized set of license terms that govern usage and define obligations of buyers and sellers\. AWS Marketplace sellers can offer SCMP as the EULA for public product listings\. Buyers can search for, buy, and quickly deploy software from sellers that offer the terms of the standard contract\. For [private offers](private-offers-overview.md), you can amend the SCMP to address custom transaction requirements as agreed upon by both parties\.

### Getting started with SCMP<a name="standard-contracts-sign-up"></a>

## Enterprise Contract for AWS Marketplace \(ECMP\)<a name="enterprise-contracts"></a>

Like SCMP, ECMP is standardized set of license terms that govern usage and define obligations of buyers and sellers\. For [private offers](private-offers-overview.md), you can amend the ECMP to address custom transaction requirements as agreed upon by both parties\.

The differences between ECMP and SCMP are as follows:
+ ECMP is designed to address the more stringent requirements of large enterprises\.
+ To offer the ECMP on your listings, you must enroll in the program\.
+ You can offer ECMP as the EULA on public product listings and private offers *only* to enrolled enterprise buyers\.

After enrolling in the ECMP program, you can still offer SCMP as your public EULA to address license requirements of non\-enterprise customers\.
