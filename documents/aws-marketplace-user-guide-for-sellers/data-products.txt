Data products
AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to securely exchange file-based data sets in the AWS Cloud. As a provider, AWS Data Exchange eliminates the need to build and maintain any data delivery, entitlement, or billing technology. Providers in AWS Data Exchange have a secure, transparent, and reliable channel to reach AWS customers and grant existing customers their subscriptions more efficiently. The process for becoming an AWS Data Exchange provider requires a few steps to determine eligibility.
A data product has the following parts:
 Product details – This information helps potential subscribers understand what the product is. This includes a name, descriptions (both short and long), a logo image, and support contact information. Product details are filled out by providers.
 Product offer(s) – In order to make a product available on AWS Data Exchange, providers must define a public offer. This includes the prices and durations, data subscription agreement, refund policy, and the option to create custom offers.
 Data set(s) – A product can contain one or more data sets. A data set is a dynamic set of file-based data content. Data sets are dynamic and are versioned using revisions. Each revision can contain multiple assets.
