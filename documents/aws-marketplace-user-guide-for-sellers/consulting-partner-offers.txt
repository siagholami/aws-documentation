Consulting partner private offers
AWS Marketplace consulting partner private offers allow consulting partners to resell independent software vendors' (ISVs) product on AWS Marketplace. The consulting partner and ISV establish an agreement to resell one or more of the ISV's products, and then they extend a private offer to the buyer for that product.
Each consulting partner private offer is visible only to a single buyer, with customized pricing and unique commercial terms to meet that buyer's needs. When creating a private offer, you start from a wholesale cost set by the ISV. Then you mark up that price to create the buyer's offer price. The wholesale cost is determined in one of two ways:
 Recurring discount – An ISV authorizes the consulting partner to resell their product or products at an agreed-to discount from their list price. The discount is expressed as a percentage off the list price. This discount allows the consulting partner to continue to resell the product without further price negotiation with the ISV.
 Non-recurring opportunity discount – The discount that the ISV gives you is intended to be used only with a specific buyer. 
In both cases, after the buyer pays for the private offer, AWS Marketplace uses the standard process to distribute the funds to the consulting partner and the ISV based on the agreed-to percentages.
