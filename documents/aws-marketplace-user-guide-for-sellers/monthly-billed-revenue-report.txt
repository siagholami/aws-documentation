Monthly billed revenue report
The monthly billed revenue report provides you authoritative information about billed revenue every month for accounting and other financial reporting purposes. This report shows the total amounts that AWS bills to customers for hourly, annual, or monthly usage of your products. The report has four sections: billed amounts for hourly usage and monthly fees, variable-length subscriptions, field demonstration usage, and flexible payments. 
Important
The amounts in this report reflect only revenue that we billed to customers, not amounts that we collected.
This report is available on the AWS Marketplace Management Portal under the Reports tab. If you're enrolled in the AWS Marketplace commerce analytics service, you can use API calls to pull down sections of this report. For more information, see AWS Marketplace Commerce Analytics Service.
