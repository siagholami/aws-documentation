# Platforms supported by the AWS SDK for \.NET<a name="net-dg-supported-platforms"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET provides distinct groups of assemblies for developers to target different platforms\. However, not all SDK functionality is the same on each of these platforms\. This topic describes the differences in support for each platform\.

## \.NET Core<a name="net-core"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET supports applications written for \.NET Core\. AWS service clients only support asynchronous calling patterns in \.NET core\. This also affects many of the high level abstractions built on top of service clients like Amazon S3â€™s `TransferUtility` which will only support asynchronous calls in the \.NET Core environment\.

## \.NET Standard 2\.0<a name="net-standard-2"></a>

Non\-Framework variations of the AWS SDK for \.NET comply with [\.NET Standard 2\.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard)\.

## \.NET Framework 4\.5<a name="net-dg-platform-diff-netfx45"></a>

\(For full information on \.NET Framework 4\.5 support, see [version 3](../../v3/developer-guide/welcome.html) of the AWS SDK for \.NET Developer Guide\.\)

This version of the AWS SDK for \.NET is compiled against \.NET Framework 4\.5 and runs in the \.NET 4\.0 runtime\. AWS service clients support synchronous and asynchronous calling patterns and use the [async and await](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/hh191443(v=vs.140)) keywords introduced in [C\# 5\.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29#Versions)\.

## \.NET Framework 3\.5<a name="net-dg-platform-diff-winrt"></a>

\(***Legacy***: Support for \.NET Framework 3\.5 is legacy\. For full information on \.NET Framework 3\.5 support, see [version 3](../../v3/developer-guide/welcome.html) of the AWS SDK for \.NET Developer Guide\.\)

## Portable Class Library and Xamarin<a name="portable-class-library"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET also contains a Portable Class Library implementation\. The Portable Class Library implementation can target multiple platforms, including Universal Windows Platform \(UWP\) and Xamarin on iOS and Android\. See the [AWS Mobile SDK for \.NET and Xamarin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforxamarin/developerguide/Welcome.html) for more details\. AWS service clients only support asynchronous calling patterns\.

## Unity support<a name="unity-support"></a>

For information about Unity support, see [Special considerations for Unity support](unity-special.md)\.
