# Working with AWS services in the AWS SDK for \.NET<a name="tutorials-examples"></a>

The following sections show examples of how you can use the AWS SDK for \.NET to work with AWS services\.

If you're new to the AWS SDK for \.NET, you might want to check out the [Quick start](quick-start.md) topic first\. It gives you an introduction to the SDK\.

**Note**  
The examples in this section are *asynchronous* and work with \.NET Core and ASP\.NET Core, and also \.NET Framework 4\.5 or later \(although \.NET Core is preferred\)\.  
If you're looking for *synchronous* \.NET Framework examples, see [version 3](../../v3/developer-guide/tutorials-examples.html) of the guide instead\.

You can find more code examples in the [AWS Code Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/dotnet) and the [awslabs repository](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-net-samples) on GitHub\.

Before you begin, be sure you have [set up your environment](net-dg-setup.md)\. Also review the information in [Setting up your project](net-dg-config.md) and [SDK features](net-dg-sdk-features.md)\.
