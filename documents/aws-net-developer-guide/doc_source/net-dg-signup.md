# Create an AWS account<a name="net-dg-signup"></a>

To use the AWS SDK for \.NET to access AWS services, you need an AWS account and AWS credentials\.

1. **Create an account\.**

   To create an AWS account, see [How do I create and activate a new Amazon Web Services account?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account)

1. **Create an administrative user\.**

   Avoid using your root user account \(the initial account you create\) to access the management console and services\. Instead, create an administrative user account, as explained in [Creating your first IAM admin user and group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html)\.

   After you create the administrative user account and record the login details, **sign out of your root user account** and sign back in using the administrative account\.

If you need to close your AWS account, see [Closing an account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/close-account.html)\.
