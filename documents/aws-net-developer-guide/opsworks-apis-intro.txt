Programming AWS OpsWorks to Work with stacks and applications
The AWS SDK for .NET supports AWS OpsWorks, which provides a simple and flexible way to create and manage stacks and applications. With AWS OpsWorks, you can provision AWS resources, manage their configuration, deploy applications to those resources, and monitor their health. For more information, see the OpsWorks product page and the AWS OpsWorks User Guide.
