Working with AWS services in the AWS SDK for .NET
The following sections show examples of how you can use the AWS SDK for .NET to work with AWS services.
If you're new to the AWS SDK for .NET, you might want to check out the Quick start topic first. It gives you an introduction to the SDK.
Note
The examples in this section are asynchronous and work with .NET Core and ASP.NET Core, and also .NET Framework 4.5 or later (although .NET Core is preferred).
If you're looking for synchronous .NET Framework examples, see version 3 of the guide instead.
You can find more code examples in the AWS Code Examples Repository and the awslabs repository on GitHub.
Before you begin, be sure you have set up your environment. Also review the information in Setting up your project and SDK features.
