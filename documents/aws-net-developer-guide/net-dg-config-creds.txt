Configure AWS credentials
After you create an AWS account and create the required user accounts, you can manage credentials for those user accounts. You need these credentials to perform many of the tasks and examples in this guide.
The following is a high-level process for credential management and use.


Create the credentials you need:
    You can create credentials when you're creating a user account. See User accounts for an example.
    You can also create credentials for an existing user account. See Managing access keys for IAM users.


Store the credentials (for example, in the shared AWS credentials file or the SDK Store).


Configure your project so that your application can find the credentials.


The following topics provide information you can use to determine how to manage and use credentials in your environment.
