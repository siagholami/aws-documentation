Launching a Gateway
You can launch any of the three storage gateways on the appliance—file gateway, volume gateway (cached), or tape gateway.
To launch a gateway on your hardware appliance


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home.


Choose Hardware.


For Actions, choose Launch Gateway.


For Gateway Type, choose File Gateway, Tape Gateway, or Volume Gateway (Cached).


For Gateway name, enter a name for your gateway. Names can be 255 characters long and can't include a slash character. 


Choose Launch gateway.


The Storage Gateway software for your chosen gateway type installs on the appliance. It can take up to 5–10 minutes for a gateway to show up as online in the console.
To assign a static IP address to your installed gateway, you next configure the gateway's network interfaces so your applications can use it.
