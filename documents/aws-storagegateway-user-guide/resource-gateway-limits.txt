Note
You can configure one or more local drives for your cache and upload buffer, up to the maximum capacity.
When adding cache or upload buffer to an existing gateway, it's important to create new disks in your host (hypervisor or Amazon EC2 instance). Don't change the size of existing disks if the disks have been previously allocated as either a cache or upload buffer.
