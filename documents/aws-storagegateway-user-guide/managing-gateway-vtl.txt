Adding Virtual Tapes
You can add tapes in your tape gateway when you need them. For information about how to create tapes, see Creating Tapes. 
After your tape is created, information about your tape is displayed in the columns and in the Details tab of your tape library. For information about tape gateway tape quotas, see AWS Storage Gateway quotas.
You can create additional tapes directly in a preselected pool that represents the storage that you want the tapes to be archived in. 
To create tapes directly in a selected pool


Open the AWS Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home.


In the navigation pane, choose the Tape Library, and then choose Pools to see the available pools.


Choose the pool that presents the storage class that you want the tapes to be archived in when the tapes are ejected from the back application. You can see details about the pool in the Details tab.


Choose Create tapes to open the Create tapes dialog box.


For Gateway, choose a gateway. The tape is created for this gateway.


For Number of tapes, choose the number of tapes that you want to create. For more information about tape quotas, see AWS Storage Gateway quotas.


For Capacity, enter the size of the virtual tape that you want to create. Tapes must be larger than 100 GiB. For information about capacity quotas, see AWS Storage Gateway quotas.


For Barcode prefix, enter the prefix that you want to prepend to the barcode of your virtual tapes.
Note
Virtual tapes are uniquely identified by a barcode, and you can add a prefix to the barcode. The prefix is optional, but you can use it to help identify your virtual tapes. The prefix must be uppercase letters (A–Z) and must be one to four characters long.


The pool that you chose in step 2 is shown in the Pool list. This pool represents the storage class in which your tape is stored when it is ejected by your backup software. 


Choose Create tapes.


In the navigation pane, choose the Tape Library tab, and then choose Tapes to see your tapes.



Glacier Pool—archives the tape in GLACIER. When your backup software ejects the tape, it is automatically archived in GLACIER. You use GLACIER for more active archives where you can retrieve the tapes typically within 3-5 hours. For detailed information, see What Is Amazon S3 Glacier? 
Deep Archive Pool—archives the tape in DEEP_ARCHIVE. When your backup software ejects the tape, the tape is automatically archived in DEEP_ARCHIVE. You use DEEP_ARCHIVE for long-term data retention and digital preservation where data is accessed once or twice a year. You can retrieve tapes archived in DEEP_ARCHIVE typically within 12 hours. For detailed information, see GLACIER Storage Class.
If you archive a tape in GLACIER, you can move it to DEEP_ARCHIVE later. For more information, see Moving Your Tape from Glacier to Deep Archive Storage Class.
Note
Tapes created before March 27, 2019, are archived directly in Amazon S3 Glacier when your backup software ejects it.
Managing Automatic Tape Creation
The tape gateway automatically creates new virtual tapes to maintain the minimum number of available tapes that you configure. It then makes these new tapes available for import by the backup application so that your backup jobs can run without interruption. Automatic tape creation removes the need for custom scripting in addition to the manual process for creating new virtual tapes. 
To change or delete automatic tape creation


Open the AWS Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home.


In the navigation pane, choose the Gateways tab.


Choose the gateway that you need to manage automatic tape creation for. 


In the Actions menu, choose Configure tape auto-create. 


To delete an automatic tape creation policy on a gateway, choose the X to the right of the policy you want to delete.


To remove automatic tape creation on a gateway, delete all of the automatic tape creation policies for that gateway.
Choose Save to confirm deletion of tape auto-create policies for the selected tape gateway.
Note
Deleting a tape auto-creation policy from a gateway cannot be undone.

To change the automatic tape creation policies for a tape gateway, choose Configure tape auto-create and modify settings here.


For Minimum number of tapes, enter the minimum number of virtual tapes that should be available on the tape gateway at all times. The valid range for this value is a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10. 


For Capacity, enter the size, in bytes of the virtual tape capacity. The valid range for this value is a minimum of 100 GiB and a maximum of 5 TiB. 


For Barcode prefix, enter the prefix that you want to prepend to the barcode of your virtual tapes.
Note
Virtual tapes are uniquely identified by a barcode, and you can add a prefix to the barcode. The prefix is optional, but you can use it to help identify your virtual tapes. The prefix must be uppercase letters (A–Z) and must be one to four characters long.


For Pool, choose Glacier Pool or Deep Archive Pool. This pool represents the storage class in which your tapes are stored when they are ejected by your backup software. 


Choose Glacier Pool if you want to archive the tapes in GLACIER. When your backup software ejects the tapes, they are automatically archived in GLACIER. You use S3 Glacier for more active archives where you can retrieve a tape typically within 3-5 hours. For detailed information, see Storage Classes for Archiving Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
Choose Deep Archive Pool if you want to archive the tapes in DEEP_ARCHIVE. When your backup software ejects the tape, the tape is automatically archived in DEEP_ARCHIVE. You use DEEP_ARCHIVE for long-term data retention and digital preservation where data is accessed once or twice a year. You can retrieve a tape archived in DEEP_ARCHIVE typically within 12 hours. For detailed information, see Storage Classes for Archiving Objects in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.
If you archive tapes in GLACIER, you can move them to DEEP_ARCHIVE later. For more information, see Moving Your Tape from Glacier to Deep Archive Storage Class.

In the navigation pane, choose the Tape Library tab, and then choose Tapes to see your tapes.


The status of available virtual tapes is initially set to CREATING when the tapes are being created. After the tapes are created, their status changes to AVAILABLE. For more information, see Managing Your Tape Gateway.
For more information about enabling automatic tape creation, see Creating Tapes Automatically.
Archiving Virtual Tapes
You can archive your tapes to Amazon S3 Glacier or DEEP_ARCHIVE. When you create a tape, you choose the archive pool that you want to use to archive your tape. 
You choose Glacier Pool if you want to archive the tape in S3 Glacier. When your backup software ejects the tape, it is automatically archived in S3 Glacier. You use S3 Glacier for more active archives where the data is regularly retrieved and needed in minutes. For detailed information, see Storage Classes for Archiving Objects 
You choose Deep Archive Pool if you want to archive the tape in DEEP_ARCHIVE. When your backup software ejects the tape, the tape is automatically archived in DEEP_ARCHIVE. You use DEEP_ARCHIVE for long-term data retention and digital preservation at a very low cost. Data in S3 Glacier DEEP_ARCHIVE is not retrieved often or is rarely retrieved. For detailed information, see Storage Classes for Archiving Objects.
Note
Any tape created before March 27, 2019, are archived directly in S3 Glacier when your backup software ejects it.
When your backup software ejects a tape, it is automatically archived in the pool that you chose when you created the tape. The process for ejecting a tape varies depending on your backup software. Some backup software requires that you export tapes after they are ejected before archiving can begin. For information about supported backup software, see Using Your Backup Software to Test Your Gateway Setup.
Moving Your Tape from Glacier to Deep Archive Storage Class
Move your tapes from GLACIER to DEEP_ARCHIVE for long-term data retention and digital preservation at a very low cost. You use DEEP_ARCHIVE for long-term data retention and digital preservation where the data is accessed once or twice a year. For detailed information, see Storage Classes for Archiving Objects.
To move a tape from GLACIER to DEEP_ARCHIVE


In the left navigation pane, choose Tape Library and choose Tapes to open the tape library.


Choose the tape or tapes you want to move to DEEP_ARCHIVE. You can see the pool that this tape is associated with in the Pool column.


For Actions, choose Assign tape to pool.


In the Assign tape to pool dialog box, verify the tape ID for the tape you are moving and choose the confirmation box. 
Note
If a tape has been ejected by the backup application and archived in DEEP_ARCHIVE you can't move it back to GLACIER. There's a charge for moving your tapes from GLACIER to DEEP_ARCHIVE. In addition, if you move tapes from GLACIER to DEEP_ARCHIVE prior to 90 days, there is an early deletion fee for GLACIER.


After the tape is moved, choose the tape and see details about the tape in the Details tab.


Retrieving Archived Tapes
To access data stored on an archived virtual tape, you must first retrieve the tape that you want to your tape gateway. Your tape gateway provides one virtual tape library (VTL) for each gateway. You only can restore a tape to a tape gateway.
If you have multiple tape gateways in an AWS Region, you can retrieve a tape to only one gateway.
The retrieved tape is write-protected; you can only read the data on the tape.
Important
If you archive a tape in GLACIER, you can retrieve the tape typically within 3-5 hours. If you archive the tape in DEEP_ARCHIVE, you can retrieve it typically within 12 hours.
Note
There is a charge for retrieving tapes from archive. For detailed pricing information, see AWS Storage Gateway Pricing.
To retrieve an archived tape to your gateway


Open the AWS Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Tapes. To display all virtual tapes that have been archived by all your gateways, use search. 


Choose the virtual tape you want to retrieve, and choose Retrieve Tape for Actions. 
Note
The status of the virtual tape that you want to retrieve must be ARCHIVED.


In the Retrieve tape dialog box, for Barcode, verify that the barcode identifies the virtual tape you want to retrieve.


For Gateway, choose the gateway that you want to retrieve the archived tape to, and then choose Retrieve tape.


The status of the tape changes from ARCHIVED to RETRIEVING. At this point, your data is being moved from the virtual tape shelf (backed by GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE) to the virtual tape library (backed by Amazon S3). After all the data is moved, the status of the virtual tape in the archive changes to RETRIEVED. 
Note
Retrieved virtual tapes are read-only.
Viewing Tape Usage
When you write data to a tape, you can view the amount of data stored on the tape in the AWS Storage Gateway Management Console. The Details tab for each tape shows the tape usage information.
To view the amount of data stored on a tape


Open the AWS Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Tapes and select the tape that you are interested in.


Choose the Details tab.


The following fields provide information about the tape:
    Size: The total capacity of the selected tape.
    Used: The size of data written to the tape by your backup application. 
Note
This value is not available for tapes created before May 13, 2015.


Deleting Tapes
You can delete virtual tapes from your tape gateway by using the AWS Storage Gateway console.
Note
If the tape you want to delete from your tape gateway has a status of RETRIEVED, you must first eject the tape using your backup application before deleting the tape. For instructions on how to eject a tape using the Symantec NetBackup software, see Archiving the Tape. After the tape is ejected, the tape status changes back to ARCHIVED. You can then delete the tape. 
Make copies of your data before you delete your tapes. After you delete a tape, you can't get it back.
To delete a virtual tape
Warning
This procedure permanently deletes the selected virtual tape.


Open the AWS Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Tapes. 


Choose the virtual tape that you want to delete. 


For Actions, choose Delete tape. A confirmation box appears, as shown following.



Make sure that the tape listed is the tape you intend to delete, select the confirmation check box, and then choose Delete.


After the tape is deleted, it disappears from the tape gateway.
Disabling Your Tape Gateway
You disable a tape gateway if the tape gateway has failed and you want to recover the tapes from the failed gateway to another gateway. 
To recover the tapes, you must first disable the failed gateway. Disabling a tape gateway locks down the virtual tapes in that gateway. That is, any data that you might write to these tapes after disabling the gateway isn't sent to AWS. You can only disable a gateway on the Storage Gateway console if the gateway is no longer connected to AWS. If the gateway is connected to AWS, you can't disable the tape gateway. 
You disable a tape gateway as part of data recovery. For more information about recovering tapes, see You Need to Recover a Virtual Tape from a Malfunctioning Tape Gateway. 
To disable your gateway


Open the AWS Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Gateways, and then choose the failed gateway.


Choose the Details tab for the gateway to display the disable gateway message.


Choose Create recovery tapes.


Choose Disable gateway.


Understanding Tape Status
Each tape has an associated status that tells you at a glance what the health of the tape is. Most of the time, the status indicates that the tape is functioning normally and that no action is needed on your part. In some cases, the status indicates a problem with the tape that might require action on your part. You can find information following to help you decide when you need to act.
