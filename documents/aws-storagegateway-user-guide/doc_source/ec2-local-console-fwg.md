## Logging In to Your Amazon EC2 Gateway Local Console<a name="EC2_MaintenanceConsoleWindow-fgw"></a>

You can connect to your Amazon EC2 instance by using a Secure Shell \(SSH\) client\. For detailed information, see [Connect to Your Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*\. To connect this way, you need the SSH key pair that you specified when you launched your instance\. For information about Amazon EC2 key pairs, see [Amazon EC2 Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide\.*<a name="EC2_MaintenanceConsoleWindowMenu-fgw"></a>

**To log in to the gateway local console**

1. Log in to your local console\. If you are connecting to your EC2 instance from a Windows computer, log in as *admin*\.

1. After you log in, you see the **AWS Appliance Activation \- Configuration** main menu, as shown in the following screenshot\.

[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/ec2-local-console-fwg.html)

To shut down the gateway, enter **0**\. 

To exit the configuration session, enter **x** to exit the menu\. 

## Routing Your Gateway Deployed on EC2 Through an HTTP Proxy<a name="EC2_MaintenanceRoutingProxy-fgw"></a>

AWS Storage Gateway supports the configuration of a Socket Secure version 5 \(SOCKS5\) proxy between your gateway deployed on Amazon EC2 and AWS\.

If your gateway must use a proxy server to communicate to the internet, then you need to configure the HTTP proxy settings for your gateway\. You do this by specifying an IP address and port number for the host running your proxy\. After you do so, AWS Storage Gateway routes all HTTPS traffic through your proxy server\. 

**To route your gateway internet traffic through a local proxy server**

1. Log in to your gateway's local console\. For instructions, see [Logging In to Your Amazon EC2 Gateway Local Console](#EC2_MaintenanceConsoleWindow-fgw)\.

1. On the **AWS Appliance Activation \- Configuration** main menu, enter **1** to begin configuring the HTTP proxy\.

## Configuring Your Gateway Network Settings<a name="EC2-MaintenanceConfiguringStaticIP-fgw"></a>

You can view and configure your Domain Name Server \(DNS\) settings through the local console\.

**To configure your gateway to use static IP addresses**

1. Log in to your gateway's local console\. For instructions, see [Logging In to Your Amazon EC2 Gateway Local Console](#EC2_MaintenanceConsoleWindow-fgw)\.

1. On the **AWS Appliance Activation \- Configuration** main menu, enter **2** to begin configuring your DNS server\.

## Testing Your Gateway Connectivity to the Internet<a name="EC2_MaintenanceTestGatewayConnectivity-fgw"></a>

You can use your gateway's local console to test your internet connection\. This test can be useful when you are troubleshooting network issues with your gateway\.

**To test your gateway's connection to the internet**

1. Log in to your gateway's local console\. For instructions, see [Logging In to Your Amazon EC2 Gateway Local Console](#EC2_MaintenanceConsoleWindow-fgw)\.

1. In the **AWS Storage Gateway Configuration** main menu, enter **3** to begin testing network connectivity\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/images/local-console-file-ec2-0.png)

   The console displays the available AWS Regions\. 

1. Choose option **1** for Storage Gateway\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/images/local-console-file-3.png)

   The console displays the available AWS Regions for Storage Gateway\.

1. Choose the AWS Region that you want to test\. For example, us\-east\-2\. For supported AWS Regions and a list of AWS service endpoints you can use with Storage Gateway, see [AWS Storage Gateway Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sg.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

   Each endpoint in the AWS Region that you choose displays either a **\[PASSED\]** or **\[FAILED\]** message, as shown following\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/ec2-local-console-fwg.html)

## Viewing Your Gateway System Resource Status<a name="EC2_system-resource-check-fgw"></a>

When your gateway starts, it checks its virtual CPU cores, root volume size, and RAM\. It then determines whether these system resources are sufficient for your gateway to function properly\. You can view the results of this check on the gateway's local console\.

**To view the status of a system resource check**

1. Log in to your gateway's local console\. For instructions, see [Logging In to Your Amazon EC2 Gateway Local Console](#EC2_MaintenanceConsoleWindow-fgw)\.

1. In the **AWS Storage Gateway Configuration** main menu, enter **4** to view the results of a system resource check\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/images/local-console-file-ec2-0.png)

   The console displays an **\[OK**\], **\[WARNING\]**, or **\[FAIL\]** message for each resource as described in the table following\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/ec2-local-console-fwg.html)

   The console also displays the number of errors and warnings next to the resource check menu option\.

## Running Storage Gateway Commands on the Local Console<a name="EC2_MaintenanceGatewayConsole-fgw"></a>

The AWS Storage Gateway console helps provide a secure environment for configuring and diagnosing issues with your gateway\. Using the console commands, you can perform maintenance tasks such as saving routing tables or connecting to AWS Support\. 

**To run a configuration or diagnostic command**

1. Log in to your gateway's local console\. For instructions, see [Logging In to Your Amazon EC2 Gateway Local Console](#EC2_MaintenanceConsoleWindow-fgw)\.

1. In the **AWS Appliance Activation Configuration** main menu, enter **5** for **Gateway Console**\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/images/local-console-file-ec2-0.png)

1. In the command prompt, enter **h**, and then press the **Return** key\.

   The console displays the **AVAILABLE COMMANDS** menu with the available commands\. After the menu, a gateway console prompt appears, as shown in the following screenshot\.
