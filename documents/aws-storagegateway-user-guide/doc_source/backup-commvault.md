# Testing Your Setup by Using Commvault<a name="backup-commvault"></a>

You can back up your data to virtual tapes, archive the tapes, and manage your virtual tape library \(VTL\) devices by using Commvault version 11\. In this topic, you can find basic documentation on how to configure the Commvault backup application for a tape gateway, perform a backup archive, and retrieve your data from archived tapes\. For detailed information about how to use Commvault, see the [Commvault documentation](http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=getting_started/c_quick_start_overview.htm) on the Commvault website\.

## Configuring Commvault to Work with VTL Devices<a name="commvault-configure-software"></a>

After you connect the VTL devices to the Windows client, you configure Commvault to recognize them\. For information about how to connect VTL devices to the Windows client, see [Connecting Your VTL Devices to a Windows client](initiator-connection-common.md#ConfiguringiSCSIClient-vtl)\. 

The Commvault backup application doesn't automatically recognize VTL devices\. You must manually add devices to expose them to the Commvault backup application and then discover the devices\. 

**To configure Commvault**

1. In the CommCell console main menu, choose **Storage**, and then choose** Expert Storage Configuration** to open the **Select MediaAgents** dialog box\.  
![\[Commvault menus\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/images/CommvaultHome2.png)

1. Choose the available media agent you want to use, choose **Add**, and then choose **OK**\.

1. In the **Expert Storage Configuration** dialog box, choose **Start**, and then choose **Detect/Configure Devices**\.

1. Leave the **Device Type** options selected, choose **Exhaustive Detection**, and then choose **OK**\.

1. In the **Confirm Exhaustive Detection** confirmation box, choose **Yes**\.

1. In the **Device Selection** dialog box, choose your library and all its drives, and then choose **OK**\. Wait for your devices to be detected, and then choose **Close** to close the log report\.

1. Right\-click your library, choose **Configure**, and then choose **Yes**\. Close the configuration dialog box\.

1. In the **Does this library have a barcode reader?** dialog box, choose **Yes**, and then for device type, choose **IBM ULTRIUM V5**\.

1. In the CommCell browser, choose **Storage Resources**, and then choose **Libraries** to see your tape library\.  
![\[CommCell browser\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/images/CommCellBrowser2.png)

1. To see your tapes in your library, open the context \(right\-click\) menu for your library, and then choose **Discover Media**, **Media location**, **Media Library**\.

1. To mount your tapes, open the context \(right\-click\) menu for your media, and then choose **Load**\.

## Creating a Storage Policy and a Subclient<a name="commvault-prepare-tapes"></a>

Every backup and restore job is associated with a storage policy and a subclient policy\. 

A storage policy maps the original location of the data to your media\.

**To create a storage policy**

1. In the CommCell browser, choose **Policies**\.

1. Open the context \(right\-click\) menu for **Storage Policies**, and then choose **New Storage Policy**\.

1. In the Create Storage Policy wizard, choose **Data Protection and Archiving**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. Type a name for **Storage Policy Name**, and then choose **Incremental Storage Policy**\. To associate this storage policy with incremental loads, choose one of the options\. Otherwise, leave the options unchecked, and then choose **Next**\.

1. In the **Do you want to Use Global Deduplication Policy?** dialog box, choose your **Deduplication** preference, and then choose **Next**\.

1. From **Library for Primary Copy**, choose your VTL library, and then choose **Next**\.

1. Verify that your media agent settings are correct, and then choose **Next**\.

1. Verify that your scratch pool settings are correct, and then choose **Next**\.

1. Configure your retention policies in **iData Agent Backup data**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. Review the encryption settings, and then choose **Next**\.

1. To see your storage policy, choose **Storage Policies**\.

You create a subclient policy and associate it with your storage policy\. A subclient policy enables you to configure similar file system clients from a central template, so that you don't have to set up many similar file systems manually\.

**To create a subclient policy**

1. In the CommCell browser, choose **Client Computers**, and then choose your client computer\. Choose **File System**, and then choose **defaultBackupSet**\.

1. Right\-click **defaultBackupSet**, choose **All Tasks**, and then choose **New Subclient**\.

1. In the **Subclient** properties box, type a name in **SubClient Name**, and then choose **OK**\.

1. Choose **Browse**, navigate to the files that you want to back up, choose **Add**, and then close the dialog box\.

1. In the **Subclient** property box, choose the **Storage Device** tab, choose a storage policy from **Storage policy**, and then choose **OK**\.

1. In the **Backup Schedule** window that appears, associate the new subclient with a backup schedule\. 

1. Choose **Do Not Schedule** for one time or on\-demand backups, and then choose **OK**\.

   You should now see your subclient in the **defaultBackupSet** tab\.

## Backing Up Data to a Tape in Commvault<a name="commvault-backup-data"></a>

You create a backup job and write data to a virtual tape by using the same procedures you use with physical tapes\. For detailed information about how to back up data, see the [Commvault documentation](https://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=features/backup/c_backup_overview.htm)\. 

## Archiving a Tape in Commvault<a name="commvault-archive-tape"></a>

You start the archiving process by ejecting the tape\. When you archive a tape, tape gateway moves the tape from the tape library to offline storage\. Before you eject and archive a tape, you might want to first check the content on the tape\. 

**To archive a tape**

1. In the CommCell browser, choose **Storage Resources**, **Libraries**, and then choose **Your library**\. Choose **Media By Location**, and then choose **Media In Library**\.

1. Open the context \(right\-click\) menu for the tape you want to archive, choose **All Tasks**, choose **Export**, and then choose **OK**\.

The archiving process can take some time to complete\. The initial status of the tape appears as **IN TRANSIT TO VTS**\. When archiving starts, the status changes to **ARCHIVING**\. When archiving is completed, the tape is no longer listed in the VTL\.

In the Commvault software, verify that the tape is no longer in the storage slot\.

In the navigation pane of the Storage Gateway console, choose **Tapes**\. Verify that your archived tape's status is **ARCHIVED**\. 

## Restoring Data from a Tape<a name="commvault-restore-data"></a>

You can restore data from a tape that has never been archived and retrieved, or from a tape that has been archived and retrieved\. For tapes that have never been archived and retrieved \(nonretrieved tapes\), you have two options to restore the data:
+ Restore by subclient
+ Restore by job ID

**To restore data from a nonretrieved tape by subclient**

1. In the CommCell browser, choose **Client Computers**, and then choose your client computer\. Choose **File System**, and then choose **defaultBackupSet\.**

1. In the **Catalog Media** dialog box, choose **Catalog only**, and then choose **OK**\.

1. Choose **CommCell Home**, and then choose **Job Controller** to monitor the status of your restore job\.

1. After the job succeeds, open the context \(right\-click\) menu for your tape, choose **View**, and then choose **View Catalog Contents**\. Take note of the **Job ID** value for use later\.

1. Choose **Recatalog/Merge**\. Make sure that **Merge only** is chosen in the **Catalog Media** dialog box\.

1. Choose **Home**, and then choose **Job Controller** to monitor the status of your restore job\.
