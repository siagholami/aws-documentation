# Using AWS Direct Connect with AWS Storage Gateway<a name="using-dx"></a>

AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to the AWS Cloud\. By using AWS Direct Connect with AWS Storage Gateway, you can create a connection for high\-throughput workload needs, providing a dedicated network connection between your on\-premises gateway and AWS\. 

Storage Gateway uses public endpoints\. With an AWS Direct Connect connection in place, you can create a public virtual interface to allow traffic to be routed to the Storage Gateway endpoints\. The public virtual interface bypasses internet service providers in your network path\. The Storage Gateway service public endpoint can be in the same AWS Region as the AWS Direct Connect location, or it can be in a different AWS Region\. 

The following illustration shows an example of how AWS Direct Connect works with Storage Gateway\.
