## Removing a Disk from a Gateway Hosted on Linux KVM<a name="remove-disk-KVM"></a>

To detach a disk from your gateway hosted on Linux Kernel\-based Virtual Machine \(KVM\) hypervisor, you can use a `virsh` command similar to the one following\. 

```
$ virsh detach-disk domain_name /device/path
```

For more details about managing KVM disks, see documentation of your Linux distribution\.
