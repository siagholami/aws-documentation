## Accessing the Gateway Local Console with Linux KVM<a name="MaintenanceConsoleWindowKVM-common"></a>

There are different ways to configure virtual machines running on KVM, depending on the Linux distribution being used\. Instructions for accessing KVM configuration options from the command line follow\. Instructions might differ depending on your KVM implementation\.

**To access your gateway's local console with KVM**

1. Use the following command to list the VMs that are currently available in KVM\. 

   ```
   # virsh list
   ```

   You can choose available VMs by `Id`\.

**To access your gateway's local console with VMware ESXi**

1. In the VMware vSphere client, select your gateway VM\.

1. Make sure that the gateway is turned on\.
**Note**  
If your gateway VM is turned on, a green arrow icon appears with the VM icon, as shown in the following screenshot\. If your gateway VM is not turned on, you can turn it on by choosing the green **Power On** icon on the **Toolbar** menu\.

**To access your gateway's local console \(Microsoft Hyper\-V\)**

1. In the **Virtual Machines** list of the Microsoft Hyper\-V Manager, select your gateway VM\.

1. Make sure that the gateway is turned on\.
**Note**  
If your gateway VM is turned on, `Running` is displayed as the **State** of the VM, as shown in the following screenshot\. If your gateway VM is not turned on, you can turn it on by choosing **Start** in the **Actions** pane\.
