## Connecting Your VTL Devices<a name="GettingStartedAccessTapesVTL"></a>

Following, you can find instructions about how to connect your virtual tape library \(VTL\) devices to your Microsoft Windows or Red Hat Enterprise Linux \(RHEL\) client\.

### Connecting to a Microsoft Windows Client<a name="iscsi-vtl-windows"></a>

The following procedure shows a summary of the steps that you follow to connect to a Windows client\.

**To connect your VTL devices to a Windows client**

1. Start iscsicpl\.exe\.
**Note**  
You must have administrator rights on the client computer to run the iSCSI initiator\.

1. Start the Microsoft iSCSI initiator service\.

1. In the **iSCSI Initiator Properties** dialog box, choose the **Discovery** tab, and then choose the **Discover Portal** button\.

1. Provide the IP address of your tape gateway for **IP address or DNS name**\.

1. Choose the **Targets** tab, and then choose **Refresh**\. All 10 tape drives and the medium changer appear in the **Discovered targets** box\. The status for the targets is **Inactive**\.

1. Choose the first device and connect it\. You connect the devices one at a time\. 

1. Connect all of the targets\.

On a Windows client, the driver provider for the tape drive must be Microsoft\. Use the following procedure to verify the driver provider, and update the driver and provider if necessary:

**To verify and update the driver and provider**

1. On your Windows client, start Device Manager\.

1. Expand **Tape drives**, open the context \(right\-click\) menu for a tape drive, and choose **Properties**\.

1. In the **Driver** tab of the **Device Properties** dialog box, verify **Driver Provider** is Microsoft\.

1. If **Driver Provider** is not Microsoft, set the value as follows:

   1. Choose **Update Driver**\.

   1. In the **Update Driver Software** dialog box, choose **Browse my computer for driver software**\.

   1. In the **Update Driver Software** dialog box, choose **Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer**\.

   1. Choose **LTO Tape drive** and choose **Next**\. 

1. Choose **Close** to close the **Update Driver Software** window, and verify that the **Driver Provider** value is now set to Microsoft\.

1.  Repeat the steps to update driver and provider for all the tape drives\.

### Connecting to a Linux Client<a name="iscsi-vtl-linux"></a>

The following procedure shows a summary of the steps that you follow to connect to an RHEL client\.

**To connect a Linux client to VTL devices**

1. Install the iscsi\-initiator\-utils RPM package\.

   You can use the following command to install the package\.

   ```
   sudo yum install iscsi-initiator-utils
   ```

1. Make sure that the iSCSI daemon is running\.

   For RHEL 5 or 6, use the following command\.

   ```
   sudo /etc/init.d/iscsi status
   ```

   For RHEL 7, use the following command\.

   ```
   sudo service iscsid status
   ```

1. Discover the volume or VTL device targets defined for a gateway\. Use the following discovery command\.

   ```
   sudo /sbin/iscsiadm --mode discovery --type sendtargets --portal [GATEWAY_IP]:3260
   ```

   The output of the discovery command looks like the following example output\.

   For volume gateways: `[GATEWAY_IP]:3260, 1 iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume `

   For tape gateways: `iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:[GATEWAY_IP]-tapedrive-01`

1. Connect to a target\. 

   Make sure to specify the correct *\[GATEWAY\_IP\]* and IQN in the connect command\.

   Use the following command\.

   ```
   sudo /sbin/iscsiadm --mode node --targetname iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:[ISCSI_TARGET_NAME] --portal [GATEWAY_IP]:3260,1 --login
   ```

1. Verify that the volume is attached to the client machine \(the initiator\)\. To do so, use the following command\.

   ```
   ls -l /dev/disk/by-path
   ```

   The output of the command should look like the following example output\.

   `lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 9 Apr 16 19:31 ip-[GATEWAY_IP]:3260-iscsi-iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume-lun-0 -> ../../sda`

   We highly recommend that after you set up your initiator you customize your iSCSI settings as discussed in [Customizing Your Linux iSCSI Settings](initiator-connection-common.md#CustomizeLinuxiSCSISettings)\.
