# Accessing AWS Storage Gateway<a name="WhatIsAPIIntro"></a>

You can use the [AWS Storage Gateway Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home) to perform various gateway configuration and management tasks\. The Getting Started section and various other sections of this guide use the console to illustrate gateway functionality\.

Additionally, you can use the AWS Storage Gateway API to programmatically configure and manage your gateways\. For more information about the API, see [API Reference for AWS Storage Gateway](AWSStorageGatewayAPI.md)\. 

You can also use the AWS SDKs to develop applications that interact with AWS Storage Gateway\. The AWS SDKs for Java, \.NET, and PHP wrap the underlying AWS Storage Gateway API to simplify your programming tasks\. For information about downloading the SDK libraries, see [Sample Code Libraries](http://aws.amazon.com/code)\.
