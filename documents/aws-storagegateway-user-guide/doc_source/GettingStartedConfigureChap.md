# Configuring CHAP Authentication for Your Volumes<a name="GettingStartedConfigureChap"></a>

In AWS Storage Gateway, your iSCSI initiators connect to your volumes as iSCSI targets\. Storage Gateway uses Challenge\-Handshake Authentication Protocol \(CHAP\) to authenticate iSCSI and initiator connections\. CHAP provides protection against playback attacks by requiring authentication to access storage volume targets\. For each volume target, you can define one or more CHAP credentials\. You can view and edit these credentials for the different initiators in the Configure CHAP credentials dialog box\.

**To configure CHAP credentials**

1. In the AWS Storage Gateway Console, choose **Volumes** and select the volume for which you want to configure CHAP credentials\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **Configure CHAP authentication**\.

1. For **Initiator name**, type the name of your initiator\. The name must be at least 1 character and at most 255 characters long\.

1. For **Initiator secret**, provide the secret phrase you want to used to authenticate your iSCSI initiator\. The initiator secret phrase must be at least 12 characters and at most 16 characters long\.

1. For **Target secret**, provide the secret phrase you want used to authenticate your target for mutual CHAP\. The target secret phrase must be at least 12 characters and at most 16 characters long\.

1. Choose **Save** to save your entries\. 

To view or update CHAP credentials, you must have the necessary IAM role permissions to that allows you to perform that operation\.
