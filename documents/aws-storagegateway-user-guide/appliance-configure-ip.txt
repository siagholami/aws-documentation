Configuring an IP Address for the Gateway
To assign a static IP address to a gateway installed on your hardware appliance, configure the IP address from the local console of that gateway. Your applications (such as your NFS or SMB client, your iSCSI initiator, and so on) connect to this IP address. You can access the gateway local console from the hardware appliance console.
