Synchronizing Your Gateway VM Time
For a gateway deployed on VMware ESXi, setting the hypervisor host time and synchronizing the VM time to the host is sufficient to avoid time drift. For more information, see Synchronizing VM Time with Host Time. For a gateway deployed on Microsoft Hyper-V, you should periodically check your VM's time using the procedure described following. 
To view and synchronize the time of a hypervisor gateway VM to a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server


Log in to your gateway's local console:
    For more information on logging in to the VMware ESXi local console, see Accessing the Gateway Local Console with VMware ESXi.
    For more information on logging in to the Microsoft Hyper-V local console, see Access the Gateway Local Console with Microsoft Hyper-V.
    For more information on logging in to the local console for Linux Kernel-based Virtuam Machine (KVM), see Accessing the Gateway Local Console with Linux KVM.


On the AWS Storage Gateway Configuration main menu, enter 4 for System Time Management.



On the System Time Management menu, enter 1 for View and Synchronize System Time.



If the result indicates that you should synchronize your VM's time to the NTP time, enter y. Otherwise, enter n.


If you enter y to synchronize, the synchronization might take a few moments.
The following screenshot shows a VM that doesn't require time synchronization.
