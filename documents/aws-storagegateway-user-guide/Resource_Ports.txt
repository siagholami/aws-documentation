Port Requirements
AWS Storage Gateway requires the following ports for its operation. Some ports are common to all gateway types and are required by all gateway types. Other ports are required by specific gateway types. In this section, you can find an illustration of the required ports and a list of the ports required by each gateway type.
File Gateways
The following illustration shows the ports to open for file gateways' operation.

Volume Gateways and Tape Gateways
The following illustration shows the ports to open for volume gateways' and tape gateways' operation.

The following ports are common to all gateway types and are required by all gateway types.

How Used




Storage Gateway VM
AWS
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
443 (HTTPS)
For communication from an AWS Storage Gateway VM to an AWS service endpoint. For information about service endpoints, see Allowing AWS Storage Gateway access through firewalls and routers.


Your web browser
Storage Gateway VM
TCP
80 (HTTP)
By local systems to obtain the Storage Gateway activation key. Port 80 is used only during activation of a Storage Gateway appliance.  A Storage Gateway VM doesn't require port 80 to be publicly accessible. The required level of access to port 80 depends on your network configuration. If you activate your gateway from the AWS Storage Gateway Management Console, the host from which you connect to the console must have access to your gateway’s port 80.


Storage Gateway VM
Domain Name Service (DNS) server
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)/UDP
53 (DNS)
For communication between a Storage Gateway VM and the DNS server.


Storage Gateway VM
AWS
TCP
22 (Support channel)
Allows AWS Support to access your gateway to help you with troubleshooting gateway issues. You don't need this port open for the normal operation of your gateway, but it is required for troubleshooting.


Storage Gateway VM
Network Time Protocol (NTP) server
UDP
123 (NTP)
Used by local systems to synchronize VM time to the host time. A Storage Gateway VM is configured to use the following NTP servers: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


AWS Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) proxy
TCP
8080 (HTTP)
Required briefly for activation.



The following table lists the required ports that must be opened for a file gateway using either the Network File System (NFS) or Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. These port rules are part of your security group definition.
