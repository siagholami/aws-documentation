Support for cached volumes and introduction of API Version 2012-06-30
In this release, AWS Storage Gateway introduces support for cached volumes. Cached volumes minimize the need to scale your on-premises storage infrastructure, while still providing your applications with low-latency access to their active data. You can create storage volumes up to 32 TiB in size and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises application servers. Data written to your cached volumes is stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), with only a cache of recently written and recently read data stored locally on your on-premises storage hardware. Cached volumes allow you to utilize Amazon S3 for data where higher retrieval latencies are acceptable, such as for older, infrequently accessed data, while maintaining storage on-premises for data where low-latency access is required. In this release, AWS Storage Gateway also introduces a new API version that, in addition to supporting the current operations, provides new operations to support cached volumes. For more information on the two AWS Storage Gateway solutions, see How AWS Storage Gateway Works (Architecture). You can also try a test setup. For instructions, see Creating a Tape Gateway.
