Managing Gateway Updates Using the AWS Storage Gateway Console
AWS Storage Gateway periodically releases important software updates for your gateway. Either you can manually apply updates on the AWS Storage Gateway Management Console, or the updates are automatically applied during the configured maintenance schedule. Although Storage Gateway checks for updates every minute, it only goes through maintenance and restarts if there are updates. 
Before any update is applied to your gateway, AWS notifies you with a message on the Storage Gateway console and your AWS Personal Health Dashboard. For more information, see AWS Personal Health Dashboard. The VM doesn't reboot, but the gateway is unavailable for a short period while it's being updated and restarted.
When you deploy and activate your gateway, a default weekly maintenance schedule is set. You can modify the maintenance schedule at any time. When updates are available, the Details tab displays a maintenance message. You can see the date and time that the last successful update was applied to your gateway on the Details tab.
Important
You can minimize the chance of any disruption to your applications due to the gateway restart by increasing the timeouts of your iSCSI initiator. For more information about increasing iSCSI initiator timeouts for Windows and Linux, see Customizing Your Windows iSCSI Settings and Customizing Your Linux iSCSI Settings.
To modify the maintenance schedule


Open the AWS Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home.


On the navigation pane, choose Gateways, and choose the gateway that you want to modify the update schedule for.


For Actions, choose Edit maintenance window to pen the Edit maintenance start time dialog box.


For Schedule, choose Weekly or Monthly to schedule updates.


If you choose Weekly, modify the values for Day of the week and Time.


If you choose Monthly, modify the values for Day of the month and Time. If you choose this option and you get an error, it means your gateway is an older version and has not been upgraded to a newer version yet.
Note
The day of the month component of the maintenance start time is represented as an ordinal number from 1 to 28, where 1 represents the first day of the month and 28 represents the last day of the month.
Your maintenance start time appears on the Details tab for the gateway next time that you open the Details tab.
