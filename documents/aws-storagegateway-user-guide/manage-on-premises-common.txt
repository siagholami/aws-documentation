Logging in to the Local Console Using Default Credentials
When the VM is ready for you to log in, the login screen is displayed. If this is your first time logging in to the local console, you use the default user name and password to log in. These default login credentials give you access to menus where you can configure gateway network settings and change the password from the local console. Storage Gateway enables you to set your own password from the AWS Storage Gateway console instead of changing the password from the local console. You don't need to know the default password to set a new password. For more information, see Setting the Local Console Password from the Storage Gateway Console.

To log in to the gateway's local console
 If this is your first time logging in to the local console, log in to the VM with the default credentials. The default user name is admin and the password is password.
Otherwise, use your credentials to log in.
Note
If your volume or tape gateway has not been updated to a newer version yet, the user name is sguser and the password is sgpassword. If you reset your password and your gateway is updated to a newer version, your the user name will change to admin but the password will be maintained.
After you log in, you see the Storage Gateway Configuration main menu, as shown in the following screenshot.

Note
We recommend changing the default password. You do this by running the passwd command from the local console menu (item 5 on the main menu). For information about how to run the command, see Running Storage Gateway Commands on the Local Console. You can also set your own password from the AWS Storage Gateway console. For more information, see Setting the Local Console Password from the Storage Gateway Console.

Setting the Local Console Password from the Storage Gateway Console
When you log in to the local console for the first time, you log in to the VM with the default credentials— The user name is admin and the password is password. We recommend that you always set a new password immediately after you create your new gateway. You can set this password from the AWS Storage Gateway console rather than the local console if you want. You don't need to know the default password to set a new password.
To set the local console password on the Storage Gateway console


Open the AWS Storage Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home.


On the navigation pane, choose Gateways then choose the gateway for which you want to set a new password.


For Actions, choose Set Local Console Password.


In the Set Local Console Password dialog box, type a new password, confirm the password and then choose Save. Your new password replaces the default password. AWS Storage Gateway does not save the password but rather safely transmits it to the VM.
Note
The password can consist of any character on the keyboard and can be 1 to 512 characters long.


Routing Your On-Premises Gateway Through a Proxy
Volume gateways and tape gateways support configuration of a Socket Secure version 5 (SOCKS5) proxy between your on-premises gateway and AWS. File gateways support configuration of an HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) proxy. 
Note
The only proxy configurations AWS Storage Gateway supports are SOCKS5 and HTTP.
If your gateway must use a proxy server to communicate to the internet, then you need to configure the SOCKS or HTTP proxy settings for your gateway. You do this by specifying an IP address and port number for the host running your proxy. After you do so, AWS Storage Gateway routes all HTTP traffic through your proxy server. For information about network requirements for your gateway, see Network and firewall requirements.
The following procedure shows you how to configure SOCKS proxy for volume gateway and tape gateway. For instructions on how to configure HTTP proxy for file gateway, see To configure an HTTP proxy for a file gateway.

[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
For information about network and firewall requirements, see Network and firewall requirements.
Synchronizing Your Gateway VM Time
After your gateway is deployed and running, in some scenarios the gateway VM's time can drift. For example, if there is a prolonged network outage and your hypervisor host and gateway do not get time updates, then the gateway VM's time will be different from the true time. When there is a time drift, a discrepancy occurs between the stated times when operations such as snapshots occur and the actual times that the operations occur.
For a gateway deployed on VMware ESXi, setting the hypervisor host time and synchronizing the VM time to the host is sufficient to avoid time drift. For more information, see Synchronizing VM Time with Host Time. 
For a gateway deployed on Microsoft Hyper-V, you should periodically check your VM's time. For more information, see Synchronizing Your Gateway VM Time.
Running Storage Gateway Commands on the Local Console
The AWS Storage Gateway console helps provide a secure environment for configuring and diagnosing issues with your gateway. Using the console commands, you can perform maintenance tasks such as saving routing tables or connecting to AWS Support.
To run a configuration or diagnostic command

Configuring Network Adapters for Your Gateway
By default, AWS Storage Gateway is configured to use the E1000 network adapter type, but you can reconfigure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 (10 GbE) network adapter. You can also configure Storage Gateway so it can be accessed by more than one IP address. You do this by configuring your gateway to use more than one network adapter.

Configuring Your Gateway to Use the VMXNET3 Network Adapter
AWS Storage Gateway supports the E1000 network adapter type in both VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor hosts. However, the VMXNET3 (10 GbE) network adapter type is supported in VMware ESXi hypervisor only. If your gateway is hosted on a VMware ESXi hypervisor, you can reconfigure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 (10 GbE) adapter type. For more information on this adapter, see the VMware website.
Important
To select VMXNET3, your guest operating system type must be Other Linux64. 
Following are the steps you take to configure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 adapter: 


Remove the default E1000 adapter.


Add the VMXNET3 adapter.


Restart your gateway.


Configure the adapter for the network.


Details on how to perform each step follow.
To remove the default E1000 adapter and configure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 adapter


In VMware, open the context (right-click) menu for your gateway and choose Edit Settings.


In the Virtual Machine Properties window, choose the Hardware tab.


For Hardware, choose Network adapter. Notice that the current adapter is E1000 in the Adapter Type section. You will replace this adapter with the VMXNET3 adapter.



Choose the E1000 network adapter, and then choose Remove. In this example, the E1000 network adapter is Network adapter 1. 
Note
Although you can run the E1000 and VMXNET3 network adapters in your gateway at the same time, we don't recommend doing so because it can cause network problems.


Choose Add to open the Add Hardware wizard.


Choose Ethernet Adapter, and then choose Next.


In the Network Type wizard, select VMXNET3 for Adapter Type, and then choose Next.


In the Virtual Machine properties wizard, verify in the Adapter Type section that Current Adapter is set to VMXNET3, and then choose OK.


In the VMware VSphere client, shut down your gateway.


In the VMware VSphere client, restart your gateway.


After your gateway restarts, reconfigure the adapter you just added to make sure that network connectivity to the internet is established. 
To configure the adapter for the network


In the VSphere client, choose the Console tab to start the local console. You will use the default login credentials to log in to the gateway's local console for this configuration task. For information about how to log in using the default credentials, see Logging in to the Local Console Using Default Credentials.




At the prompt, type 2 to select Network Configuration, and then press Enter to open the network configuration menu.


At the prompt, type 4 to select Reset to DHCP, and then type y (for yes) at the prompt to reset the adapter you just added to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). You can type 5 to set all adapters to DHCP.


At the Enter the adapter prompt, type eth0, and then press Enter to continue. The only adapter available is eth0.



If your gateway is already activated, you must shut it down and restart it from the AWS Storage Gateway Management Console. After the gateway restarts, you must test network connectivity to the internet. For information about how to test network connectivity, see Testing Your Gateway Connection to the Internet.
Configuring Your Gateway for Multiple NICs
If you configure your gateway to use multiple network adapters (NICs), it can be accessed by more than one IP address. You might want to do this in the following situations:
 *Maximizing throughput – You might want to maximize throughput to a gateway when network adapters are a bottleneck.
 Application separation – You might need to separate how your applications write to a gateway's volumes. For example, you might choose to have a critical storage application exclusively use one particular adapter defined for your gateway.
 Network constraints* – Your application environment might require that you keep your iSCSI targets and the initiators that connect to them in an isolated network that is different from the network by which the gateway communicates with AWS.
In a typical multiple-adapter use case, one adapter is configured as the route by which the gateway communicates with AWS (that is, as the default gateway). Except for this one adapter, initiators must be in the same subnet as the adapter that contains the iSCSI targets to which they connect. Otherwise, communication with the intended targets might not be possible. If a target is configured on the same adapter that is used for communication with AWS, then iSCSI traffic for that target and AWS traffic will flow through the same adapter.
When you configure one adapter to connect to the AWS Storage gateway console and then add a second adapter, storage gateway automatically configures the route table to use the second adapter as the preferred route. For instructions on how to configure multiple-adapters, see the following sections.
