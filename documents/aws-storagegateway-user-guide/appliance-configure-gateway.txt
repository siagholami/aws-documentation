Configuring Your Gateway
After your hardware appliance has been activated and configured, your appliance appears in the console. Now you can create the type of gateway that you want. Continue the installation for your gateway type at the one of the configure local disks sections:
 For file gateway, see: Configuring local disks.
 For tape gateway, see: Configuring Local Disks.
 For volume gateway, see: Configuring Local Disks.
