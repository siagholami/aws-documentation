Point
The X and Y coordinates of a point on a document page. The X and Y values that are returned are ratios of the overall document page size. For example, if the input document is 700 x 200 and the operation returns X=0.5 and Y=0.25, then the point is at the (350,50) pixel coordinate on the document page.
An array of Point objects, Polygon, is returned as part of the Geometry object that's returned in a Block object. A Polygon object represents a fine-grained polygon around detected text, a key-value pair, a table, a table cell, or a selection element.
