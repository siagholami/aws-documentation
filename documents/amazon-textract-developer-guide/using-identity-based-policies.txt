Permissions Required to Use the Amazon Textract Console
Amazon Textract doesn't require any additional permissions when you're working with the Amazon Textract console.
AWS Managed (Predefined) Policies for Amazon Textract
AWS addresses many common use cases by providing standalone IAM policies that are created and administered by AWS. These AWS managed policies grant necessary permissions for common use cases so that you can avoid having to investigate what permissions are needed. For more information, see AWS Managed Policies in the IAM User Guide. 
The following AWS managed policies, which you can attach to users in your account, are specific to Amazon Textract:
 AmazonTextractFullAccess – Grants full access to Amazon Textract.
 AmazonTextractServiceRole – Allows Amazon Textract to call Amazon SNS services on your behalf.
Note
You can review these permissions policies by signing in to the IAM console and searching for specific policies there.
These policies work when you're using AWS SDKs or the AWS CLI.
You can also create your own custom IAM policies to allow permissions for Amazon Textract actions and resources. You can attach these custom policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions.
