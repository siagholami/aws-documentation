Amazon Textract API Permissions: Actions, Permissions, and Resources Reference
When you're setting up access control and writing a permissions policy that you can attach to an IAM identity (identity-based policies), you can use the following as a reference (for more information, see Access Control). The table list includes each Amazon Textract API operation, the corresponding actions for which you can grant permissions to perform the action, and the AWS resource that you can grant the permissions for. You specify the actions in the policy's Action field, and you specify the resource value in the policy's Resource field. 
You can use AWS-wide condition keys in your Amazon Textract policies to express conditions. For a complete list of AWS-wide keys, see Available Keys in the IAM User Guide. 
Note
To specify an action, use the textract prefix followed by the API operation name (for example, textract:DetectDocumentText).
