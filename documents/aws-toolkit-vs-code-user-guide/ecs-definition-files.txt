Using IntelliSense for Amazon ECS task-definition files
One of the things that you might do when working with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is to create task definitions, as described in Creating a Task Definition from the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. When you install the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, the installation includes IntelliSense functionality for Amazon ECS task-definition files.
Prerequisites

Be sure your system meets the prerequisites specified in Installing the Toolkit for VS Code.

Use IntelliSense in Amazon ECS task-definition files
The following example shows you how you can take advantage of IntelliSense in Amazon ECS task-definition files.

Create a JSON file for your Amazon ECS task definition. The file's name must have ecs-task-def.json at the end, but can have additional characters at the beginning.

For this example, create a file named my-ecs-task-def.json


Open the file in a VS Code editor and enter the initial curly braces.


Enter the letter "c" as if you wanted to add cpu to the definition. Observe the IntelliSense dialog that opens, which is similar to the following.
