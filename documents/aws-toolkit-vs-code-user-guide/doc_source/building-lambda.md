# Working with AWS Lambda Functions<a name="building-lambda"></a>

The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code provides support for [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions\. Using the Toolkit for VS Code, you can author code for Lambda functions that are part of [serverless applications](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/)\. In addition, you can invoke Lambda functions either locally or on AWS\.

Lambda is a fully managed compute service that runs your code in response to events generated by custom code or from various AWS services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\), and Amazon Cognito\.
