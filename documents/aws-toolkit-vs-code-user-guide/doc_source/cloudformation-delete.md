# Deleting an AWS CloudFormation stack<a name="cloudformation-delete"></a>

You can use the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code to delete AWS CloudFormation stacks\.

## Prerequisites<a name="cloudformation-delete-prereq"></a>
+ Be sure your system meets the the prerequisites specified in [Installing the Toolkit for VS Code](setup-toolkit.md#setup-prereq)\.
+ Ensure that the credentials you configured in [Establishing credentials](establish-credentials.md) include appropriate read/write access to the AWS CloudFormation service\. If in the **AWS Explorer**, under **CloudFormation**, you see a message similar to "Error loading CloudFormation resources", check the permissions attached to those credentials\. Changes that you make to permissions will take a few minutes to affect the **AWS Explorer** in VS Code\.
