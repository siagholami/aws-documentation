# Using AWS\-supported credentials<a name="aws-credentials"></a>

AWS credentials can be provided to the AWS Toolkit for VS Code by using your *shared AWS conÔ¨Åg file* or your *shared AWS credentials file*\. The methods for using these files are the same as those for the AWS CLI\. For general information about how to use these files, see [Configuration and Credential Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.
