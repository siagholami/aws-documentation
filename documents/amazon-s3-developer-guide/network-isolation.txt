Infrastructure security in Amazon S3
As a managed service, Amazon S3 is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes whitepaper.
Access to Amazon S3 via the network is through AWS published APIs. Clients must support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE). Additionally, requests must be signed using AWS Signature V4 or AWS Signature V2, requiring valid credentials to be provided.
These APIs are callable from any network location. However, Amazon S3 does support resource-based access policies, which can include restrictions based on the source IP address. You can also use Amazon S3 bucket policies to control access to buckets from specific Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints, or specific VPCs. Effectively, this isolates network access to a given Amazon S3 bucket from only the specific VPC within the AWS network. For more information, see Example Bucket Policies for VPC Endpoints for Amazon S3.
