Downloading objects in Requester Pays buckets
Because requesters are charged for downloading data from Requester Pays buckets, the requests must contain a special parameter, x-amz-request-payer, which confirms that the requester knows he or she will be charged for the download. To access objects in Requester Pays buckets, requests must include one of the following.
 For GET, HEAD, and POST requests, include x-amz-request-payer : requester in the header
 For signed URLs, include x-amz-request-payer=requester in the request
If the request succeeds and the requester is charged, the response includes the header x-amz-request-charged:requester. If x-amz-request-payer is not in the request, Amazon S3 returns a 403 error and charges the bucket owner for the request.
Note
Bucket owners do not need to add x-amz-request-payer to their requests.
Ensure that you have included x-amz-request-payer and its value in your signature calculation. For more information, see Constructing the CanonicalizedAmzHeaders Element.
To download objects from a Requester Pays bucket
  Use a GET request to download an object from a Requester Pays bucket, as shown in the following request.
1. GET / [destinationObject] HTTP/1.1
  2. Host: [BucketName].s3.amazonaws.com
  3. x-amz-request-payer : requester
  4. Date: Wed, 01 Mar 2009 12:00:00 GMT
  5. Authorization: AWS [Signature]
If the GET request succeeds and the requester is charged, the response includes x-amz-request-charged:requester.
Amazon S3 can return an Access Denied error for requests that try to get objects from a Requester Pays bucket. For more information, see Error Responses.
