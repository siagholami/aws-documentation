Specifying Server-Side Encryption Using the REST API
At the time of object creation—that is, when you are uploading a new object or making a copy of an existing object—you can specify if you want Amazon S3 to encrypt your data by adding the x-amz-server-side-encryption header to the request. Set the value of the header to the encryption algorithm AES256 that Amazon S3 supports. Amazon S3 confirms that your object is stored using server-side encryption by returning the response header x-amz-server-side-encryption. 
The following REST upload APIs accept the x-amz-server-side-encryption request header.
 PUT Object
 PUT Object - Copy
 POST Object
 Initiate Multipart Upload
When uploading large objects using the multipart upload API, you can specify server-side encryption by adding the x-amz-server-side-encryption header to the Initiate Multipart Upload request. When you are copying an existing object, regardless of whether the source object is encrypted or not, the destination object is not encrypted unless you explicitly request server-side encryption.
The response headers of the following REST APIs return the x-amz-server-side-encryption header when an object is stored using server-side encryption. 
 PUT Object
 PUT Object - Copy
 POST Object
 Initiate Multipart Upload
 Upload Part
 Upload Part - Copy
 Complete Multipart Upload
 Get Object
 Head Object
Note
Encryption request headers should not be sent for GET requests and HEAD requests if your object uses SSE-S3 or you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.
