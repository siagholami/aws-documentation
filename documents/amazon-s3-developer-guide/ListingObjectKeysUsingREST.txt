Listing Keys Using the REST API
You can use the AWS SDK to list the object keys in a bucket. However, if your application requires it, you can send REST requests directly. You can send a GET request to return some or all of the objects in a bucket or you can use selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a bucket. For more information, go to GET Bucket (List Objects) Version 2.
