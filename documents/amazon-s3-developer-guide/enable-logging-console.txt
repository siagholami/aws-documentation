Enabling logging using the console
For information about enabling Amazon S3 server access logging in the AWS Management Console, see  How Do I Enable Server Access Logging for an S3 Bucket? in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide. 
When you enable logging on a bucket, the console both enables logging on the source bucket and adds a grant in the target bucket's access control list (ACL) granting write permission to the Log Delivery group. 
For information about how to enable logging programmatically, see Enabling logging programmatically.
For information about the log record format, including the list of fields and their descriptions, see Amazon S3 Server Access Log Format.
