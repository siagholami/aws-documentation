Using the AWS Java SDK for multipart upload (high-level API)
Topics
 Upload a file
 Stop multipart uploads
 Track multipart upload progress
The AWS SDK for Java exposes a high-level API, called TransferManager, that simplifies multipart uploads (see Uploading objects using multipart upload API). You can upload data from a file or a stream. You can also set advanced options, such as the part size you want to use for the multipart upload, or the number of concurrent threads you want to use when uploading the parts. You can also set optional object properties, the storage class, or the ACL. You use the PutObjectRequest and the TransferManagerConfiguration classes to set these advanced options. 
When possible, TransferManager attempts to use multiple threads to upload multiple parts of a single upload at once. When dealing with large content sizes and high bandwidth, this can increase throughput significantly.
In addition to file-upload functionality, the TransferManager class enables you to stop an in-progress multipart upload. An upload is considered to be in progress after you initiate it and until you complete or stop it. The TransferManager stops all in-progress multipart uploads on a specified bucket that were initiated before a specified date and time.
