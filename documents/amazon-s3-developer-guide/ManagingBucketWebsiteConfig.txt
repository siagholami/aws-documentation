Programmatically configuring a bucket as a static website
To host a static website on Amazon S3, you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload your website content to the bucket. You can also use the AWS SDKs to create, update, and delete the website configuration programmatically. The SDKs provide wrapper classes around the Amazon S3 REST API. If your application requires it, you can send REST API requests directly from your application.
