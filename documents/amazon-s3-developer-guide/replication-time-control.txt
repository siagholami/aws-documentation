Meet compliance requirements using S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC)
S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) helps you meet compliance or business requirements for data replication and provides visibility into Amazon S3 replication times. S3 RTC replicates most objects that you upload to Amazon S3 in seconds, and 99.99 percent of those objects within 15 minutes. 
S3 RTC includes replication metrics, with which you can monitor the total number of S3 API operations that are pending replication, the total size of objects pending replication, and the maximum replication time to the destination Region.
With S3 RTC, Amazon S3 events can notify you in the rare instance when objects do not replicate within 15 minutes and when those objects replicate successfully to their destination Region. Amazon S3 events are available through Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, or AWS Lambda. For more information, see  Configuring Amazon S3 event notifications.

 Best practices and guidelines for S3 RTC
Enabling S3 Replication Time Control
You can start using S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) with a new or existing replication rule. You can choose to apply your replication rule to an entire S3 bucket, or to Amazon S3 objects with a specific prefix or tag. When you enable S3 RTC, replication metrics are also enabled on your replication rule. 
Replication configurations with S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) specified are written in the latest XML V2. XML V2 replication configurations are those that contain the Filter element for rules. In V2 replication configurations, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate delete markers. Therefore, you must set the DeleteMarkerReplication element to Disabled.
Note
 Replication metrics are billed at the same rate as Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics. For information, see Amazon CloudWatch pricing. 
You can configure Replication Time Control using the Amazon S3 console, the Amazon S3 API, the AWS SDKs, and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
For more information about creating a rule with S3 RTC, see Replication walkthroughs: S3 RTC configuration.
Replication metrics overview
Replication rules with S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) enabled publishes replication metrics. With replication metrics, you can monitor the total number of S3 API operations that are pending replication, the total size of objects pending replication, and the maximum replication time to the destination Region. You can then monitor each dataset that you replicate separately.
Replication metrics are available within 15 minutes of enabling S3 RTC. Replication metrics are available through the Amazon S3 console, the Amazon S3 API, the AWS SDKs, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and Amazon CloudWatch. For more information, see Monitoring metrics with Amazon CloudWatch.
For more information about finding replication metrics via the Amazon S3 console, see How do I view replication metrics in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide.
Using Amazon S3 event notifications to track replication objects
You can track replication time for objects that did not replicate within 15 minutes by monitoring specific event notifications that S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) publishes. These events are published when an object that was eligible for replication using S3 RTC didn't replicate within 15 minutes, and when that object replicates to the destination Region. 
Replication events are available within 15 minutes of enabling S3 RTC. Amazon S3 events are available through Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, or AWS Lambda. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 event notifications.
