Using MFA delete
If a bucket's versioning configuration is MFA Deleteâ€“enabled, the bucket owner must include the x-amz-mfa request header in requests to permanently delete an object version or change the versioning state of the bucket. Requests that include x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS. The header's value is the concatenation of your authentication device's serial number, a space, and the authentication code displayed on it. If you do not include this request header, the request fails.
For more information about authentication devices, see https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/.
