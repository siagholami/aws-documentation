Example 2: Configuring replication when the source and destination buckets are owned by different accounts
Setting up replication when source and destination buckets are owned by different AWS accounts is similar to setting replication when both buckets are owned by the same account. The only difference is that the destination bucket owner must grant the source bucket owner permission to replicate objects by adding a bucket policy. 
To configure replication when the source and destination buckets are owned by different AWS accounts


In this example, you create source and destination buckets in two different AWS accounts. You need to have two credential profiles set for the AWS CLI (in this example, we use acctA and acctB for profile names). For more information about setting credential profiles, see Named Profiles in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. 


Follow the step-by-step instructions in Example 1: Configuring for buckets in the same account with the following changes:
    For all AWS CLI commands related to source bucket activities (for creating the source bucket, enabling versioning, and creating the IAM role), use the acctA profile. Use the acctB profile to create the destination bucket. 
    Make sure that the permissions policy specifies the source and destination buckets that you created for this example.


In the console, add the following bucket policy on the destination bucket to allow the owner of the source bucket to replicate objects. Be sure to edit the policy by providing the AWS account ID of the source bucket owner and the destination bucket name.


{
      "Version":"2008-10-17",
      "Id":"",
      "Statement":[
         {
            "Sid":"1",
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Principal":{
               "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::source-bucket-acct-ID:source-acct-IAM-role"
            },
            "Action":["s3:ReplicateObject", "s3:ReplicateDelete"],
            "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::destination/*"
         },
         {
            "Sid":"2",
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Principal":{
               "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::source-bucket-acct-ID:source-acct-IAM-role"
            },
            "Action":["s3:GetBucketVersioning", "s3:PutBucketVersioning"],
            "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::destination"
         }
      ]
   }
Choose the bucket and add the bucket policy. For instructions, see How Do I Add an S3 Bucket Policy? in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide.
