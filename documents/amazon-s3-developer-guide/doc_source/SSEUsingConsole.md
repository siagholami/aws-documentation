When uploading an object using the AWS Management Console, you can specify server\-side encryption\. For an example of how to upload an object, see [Uploading S3 Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/upload-objects.html)\. 

When you copy an object using the AWS Management Console, the console copies the object as is\. That is, if the copy source is encrypted, the target object is encrypted\.The console also allows you to add encryption to an object\.
