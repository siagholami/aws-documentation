It assumes that you are already following the instructions for [Using the AWS SDK for PHP and Running PHP Examples](UsingTheMPphpAPI.md) and have the AWS SDK for PHP properly installed\.

The following PHP example shows how to stop an in\-progress multipart upload using the `abortMultipartUpload()` method\. For information about running the PHP examples in this guide, see [Running PHP Examples](UsingTheMPphpAPI.md#running-php-samples)\.

```
 require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Aws\S3\S3Client;

$bucket = '*** Your Bucket Name ***';
$keyname = '*** Your Object Key ***';
$uploadId = '*** Upload ID of upload to Abort ***';

$s3 = new S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-east-1'
]);

// Abort the multipart upload.
$s3->abortMultipartUpload([
    'Bucket'   => $bucket,
    'Key'      => $keyname,
    'UploadId' => $uploadId,
]);
```
