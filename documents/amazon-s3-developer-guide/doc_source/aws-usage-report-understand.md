**Notes:**

1. If you terminate a transfer before completion, the amount of data that is transferred might exceed the amount of data that your application receives\. This discrepancy can occur because a transfer termination request cannot be executed instantaneously, and some amount of data might be in transit pending execution of the termination request\. This data in transit is billed as data transferred âout\.â

1. For more information on the byte\-hours unit, see [Converting Usage Byte\-Hours to Billed GB\-Months](#aws-usage-report-understand-converting-byte-hours)\.

1. When objects that are archived to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class before the minimum storage commitment has passed, which is 90 days for S3 Glacier or 180\-days for S3 Glacier Deep Archive, there is a prorated charge per gigabyte for the remaining days\.

1. For objects that are in INTELLIGENT\_TIERING, STANDARD\_IA, or ONEZONE\_IA storage, when they are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class prior to 30 days, there is a prorated charge per gigabyte for the remaining days\.

1. For small objects \(smaller than 128 KB\) that are in STANDARD\_IA or ONEZONE\_IA storage, when they are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class prior to 30 days, there is a prorated charge per gigabyte for the remaining days\.

1. There is no minimum billable object size for objects in the INTELLIGENT\_TIERING storage class, but objects that are smaller than 128 KB are not eligible for auto\-tiering and are always charged at the rate for the INTELLIGENT\_TIERING frequent access tier\. 

## Tracking Operations in Your Usage Reports<a name="aws-usage-report-understand-operations"></a>

Operations describe the action taken on your AWS object or bucket by the specified usage type\. Operations are indicated by self\-explanatory codes, such as `PutObject` or `ListBucket`\. To see which actions on your bucket generated a specific type of usage, use these codes\. When you create a usage report, you can choose to include **All Operations**, or a specific operation, for example, **GetObject**, to report on\.

## Converting Usage Byte\-Hours to Billed GB\-Months<a name="aws-usage-report-understand-converting-byte-hours"></a>

The volume of storage that we bill you for each month is based on the average amount of storage you used throughout the month\. You are billed for all of the object data and metadata stored in buckets that you created under your AWS account\. For more information about metadata, see [Object key and metadata](UsingMetadata.md)\. 

We measure your storage usage in TimedStorage\-ByteHrs, which are totaled up at the end of the month to generate your monthly charges\. The usage report reports your storage usage in byte\-hours and the billing reports report storage usage in GB\-months\. To correlate your usage report to your billing reports, you need to convert byte\-hours into GB\-months\.

For example, if you store 100 GB \(107,374,182,400 bytes\) of STANDARD Amazon S3 storage data in your bucket for the first 15 days in March, and 100 TB \(109,951,162,777,600 bytes\) of STANDARD Amazon S3 storage data for the final 16 days in March, you will have used 42,259,901,212,262,400 byte\-hours\.

First, calculate the total byte\-hour usage:

```
[107,374,182,400 bytes x 15 days x (24 hours/day)] 
    + [109,951,162,777,600 bytes x 16 days x (24 hours/day)]
    = 42,259,901,212,262,400 byte-hours
```

Then convert the byte\-hours to GB\-Months:

```
42,259,901,212,262,400 byte-hours/1,073,741,824 bytes per GB/24 hours per day
     /31 days in March 
     =52,900 GB-Months
```
