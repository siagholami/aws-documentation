# Performance Design Patterns for Amazon S3<a name="optimizing-performance-design-patterns"></a>

When designing applications to upload and retrieve objects from Amazon S3, use our best practices design patterns for achieving the best performance for your application\. We also offer [Performance Guidelines](optimizing-performance-guidelines.md) for you to consider when planning your application architecture\.

To optimize performance, you can use the following design patterns\.

## Using Caching for Frequently Accessed Content<a name="optimizing-performance-caching"></a>

Many applications that store data in Amazon S3 serve a “working set” of data that is repeatedly requested by users\. If a workload is sending repeated GET requests for a common set of objects, you can use a cache such as [Amazon CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/index.html), [Amazon ElastiCache](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/index.html), or [AWS Elemental MediaStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/index.html) to optimize performance\. Successful cache adoption can result in low latency and high data transfer rates\. Applications that use caching also send fewer direct requests to Amazon S3, which can help reduce request costs\.

Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network \(CDN\) that transparently caches data from Amazon S3 in a large set of geographically distributed points of presence \(PoPs\)\. When objects might be accessed from multiple Regions, or over the internet, CloudFront allows data to be cached close to the users that are accessing the objects\. This can result in high performance delivery of popular Amazon S3 content\. For information about CloudFront, see the [Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/)\.

Amazon ElastiCache is a managed, in\-memory cache\. With ElastiCache, you can provision Amazon EC2 instances that cache objects in memory\. This caching results in orders of magnitude reduction in GET latency and substantial increases in download throughput\. To use ElastiCache, you modify application logic to both populate the cache with hot objects and check the cache for hot objects before requesting them from Amazon S3\. For examples of using ElastiCache to improve Amazon S3 GET performance, see the blog post [Turbocharge Amazon S3 with Amazon ElastiCache for Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/turbocharge-amazon-s3-with-amazon-elasticache-for-redis/)\.

AWS Elemental MediaStore is a caching and content distribution system specifically built for video workflows and media delivery from Amazon S3\. MediaStore provides end\-to\-end storage APIs specifically for video, and is recommended for performance\-sensitive video workloads\. For information about MediaStore, see the [AWS Elemental MediaStore User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/)\. 

## Timeouts and Retries for Latency\-Sensitive Applications<a name="optimizing-performance-timeouts-retries"></a>

There are certain situations where an application receives a response from Amazon S3 indicating that a retry is necessary\. Amazon S3 maps bucket and object names to the object data associated with them\. If an application generates high request rates \(typically sustained rates of over 5,000 requests per second to a small number of objects\), it might receive HTTP 503 *slowdown* responses\. If these errors occur, each AWS SDK implements automatic retry logic using exponential backoff\. If you are not using an AWS SDK, you should implement retry logic when receiving the HTTP 503 error\. For information about back\-off techniques, see [Error Retries and Exponential Backoff in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/api-retries.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

Amazon S3 automatically scales in response to sustained new request rates, dynamically optimizing performance\. While Amazon S3 is internally optimizing for a new request rate, you will receive HTTP 503 request responses temporarily until the optimization completes\. After Amazon S3 internally optimizes performance for the new request rate, all requests are generally served without retries\. 

For latency\-sensitive applications, Amazon S3 advises tracking and aggressively retrying slower operations\. When you retry a request, we recommend using a new connection to Amazon S3 and performing a fresh DNS lookup\. 

When you make large variably sized requests \(for example, more than 128 MB\), we advise tracking the throughput being achieved and retrying the slowest 5 percent of the requests\. When you make smaller requests \(for example, less than 512 KB\), where median latencies are often in the tens of milliseconds range, a good guideline is to retry a GET or PUT operation after 2 seconds\. If additional retries are needed, the best practice is to back off\. For example, we recommend issuing one retry after 2 seconds and a second retry after an additional 4 seconds\.

If your application makes fixed\-size requests to Amazon S3, you should expect more consistent response times for each of these requests\. In this case, a simple strategy is to identify the slowest 1 percent of requests and to retry them\. Even a single retry is frequently effective at reducing latency\.

If you are using AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) for server\-side encryption, see [Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* for information about the request rates that are supported for your use case\.

## Horizontal Scaling and Request Parallelization for High Throughput<a name="optimizing-performance-parallelization"></a>

Amazon S3 is a very large distributed system\. To help you take advantage of its scale, we encourage you to horizontally scale parallel requests to the Amazon S3 service endpoints\. In addition to distributing the requests within Amazon S3, this type of scaling approach helps distribute the load over multiple paths through the network\.

For high\-throughput transfers, Amazon S3 advises using applications that use multiple connections to GET or PUT data in parallel\. For example, this is supported by [Amazon S3 Transfer Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/examples-s3-transfermanager.html) in the AWS Java SDK, and most of the other AWS SDKs provide similar constructs\. For some applications, you can achieve parallel connections by launching multiple requests concurrently in different application threads, or in different application instances\. The best approach to take depends on your application and the structure of the objects that you are accessing\.

You can use the AWS SDKs to issue GET and PUT requests directly rather than employing the management of transfers in the AWS SDK\. This approach lets you tune your workload more directly, while still benefiting from the SDK’s support for retries and its handling of any HTTP 503 responses that might occur\. As a general rule, when you download large objects within a Region from Amazon S3 to [Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/index.html), we suggest making concurrent requests for byte ranges of an object at the granularity of 8–16 MB\. Make one concurrent request for each 85–90 MB/s of desired network throughput\. To saturate a 10 Gb/s network interface card \(NIC\), you might use about 15 concurrent requests over separate connections\. You can scale up the concurrent requests over more connections to saturate faster NICs, such as 25 Gb/s or 100 Gb/s NICs\. 

Measuring performance is important when you tune the number of requests to issue concurrently\. We recommend starting with a single request at a time\. Measure the network bandwidth being achieved and the use of other resources that your application uses in processing the data\. You can then identify the bottleneck resource \(that is, the resource with the highest usage\), and hence the number of requests that are likely to be useful\. For example, if processing one request at a time leads to a CPU usage of 25 percent, it suggests that up to four concurrent requests can be accommodated\. Measurement is essential, and it is worth confirming resource use as the request rate is increased\. 

If your application issues requests directly to Amazon S3 using the REST API, we recommend using a pool of HTTP connections and re\-using each connection for a series of requests\. Avoiding per\-request connection setup removes the need to perform TCP slow\-start and Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) handshakes on each request\. For information about using the REST API, see the [Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/)\.

Finally, it’s worth paying attention to DNS and double\-checking that requests are being spread over a wide pool of Amazon S3 IP addresses\. DNS queries for Amazon S3 cycle through a large list of IP endpoints\. But caching resolvers or application code that reuses a single IP address do not benefit from address diversity and the load balancing that follows from it\. Network utility tools such as the `netstat` command line tool can show the IP addresses being used for communication with Amazon S3, and we provide guidelines for DNS configurations to use\. For more information about these guidelines, see [DNS considerations](DNSConsiderations.md)\.

## Using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to Accelerate Geographically Disparate Data Transfers<a name="optimizing-performance-acceleration"></a>

[Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration](transfer-acceleration.md) is effective at minimizing or eliminating the latency caused by geographic distance between globally dispersed clients and a regional application using Amazon S3\. Transfer Acceleration uses the globally distributed edge locations in CloudFront for data transport\. The AWS edge network has points of presence in more than 50 locations\. Today, it is used to distribute content through CloudFront and to provide rapid responses to DNS queries made to [Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/index.html)\. 

The edge network also helps to accelerate data transfers into and out of Amazon S3\. It is ideal for applications that transfer data across or between continents, have a fast internet connection, use large objects, or have a lot of content to upload\. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path\. In general, the farther away you are from an Amazon S3 Region, the higher the speed improvement you can expect from using Transfer Acceleration\. 

You can set up Transfer Acceleration on new or existing buckets\. You can use a separate Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration endpoint to use the AWS edge locations\. The best way to test whether Transfer Acceleration helps client request performance is to use the [Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration Speed Comparison tool](https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html)\. Network configurations and conditions vary from time to time and from location to location\. So you are charged only for transfers where Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can potentially improve your upload performance\. For information about using Transfer Acceleration with different AWS SDKs, see [Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration Examples](transfer-acceleration-examples.md)\.
