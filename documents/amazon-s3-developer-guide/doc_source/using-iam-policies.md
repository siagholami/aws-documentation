Bucket policies and user policies are two access policy options available for granting permission to your Amazon S3 resources\. Both use JSON\-based access policy language\. 

The topics in this section describe the key policy language elements, with emphasis on Amazon S3â€“specific details, and provide example bucket and user policies\.

**Important**  
Bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size\.  
We recommend that you first review the introductory topics that explain the basic concepts and options available for you to manage access to your Amazon S3 resources\.
