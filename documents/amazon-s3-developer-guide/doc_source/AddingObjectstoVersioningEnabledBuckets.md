# Adding objects to versioning\-enabled buckets<a name="AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets"></a>

Once you enable versioning on a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically adds a unique version ID to every object stored \(using `PUT`, `POST`, or `COPY`\) in the bucket\. 

The following figure shows that Amazon S3 adds a unique version ID to an object when it is added to a versioning\-enabled bucket\.

 For instructions, see [How Do I Upload an Object to an S3 Bucket? ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/upload-objects.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide*\. 

## Using the AWS SDKs<a name="add-obj-versioning-enabled-bucket-sdk"></a>

For examples of uploading objects using the AWS SDKs for Java, \.NET, and PHP, see [Uploading objects](UploadingObjects.md)\. The examples for uploading objects in nonversioned and versioning\-enabled buckets are the same, although in the case of versioning\-enabled buckets, Amazon S3 assigns a version number\. Otherwise, the version number is null\. 

For information about using other AWS SDKs, see [Sample Code and Libraries](https://aws.amazon.com/code/)\.

**Adding objects to versioning\-enabled buckets**  

|  |  | 
| --- |--- |
| 1 | Enable versioning on a bucket using a PUT Bucket versioning request\. For more information, see [PUT Bucket versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTVersioningStatus.html)\. | 
| 2 | Send a PUT, POST, or COPY request to store an object in the bucket\. | 

When you add an object to a versioning\-enabled bucket, Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the object in the `x-amz-version-id` response header, for example:

```
1. x-amz-version-id: 3/L4kqtJlcpXroDTDmJ+rmSpXd3dIbrHY
```

**Note**  
Normal Amazon S3 rates apply for every version of an object stored and transferred\. Each version of an object is the entire object; it is not just a diff from the previous version\. Thus, if you have three versions of an object stored, you are charged for three objects\. 

**Note**  
The version ID values that Amazon S3 assigns are URL safe \(can be included as part of a URI\)\.
