# List multipart uploads using the low\-level AWS SDK for PHP API<a name="LLlistMPuploadsPHP"></a>

This topic shows how to use the low\-level API classes from version 3 of the AWS SDK for PHP to list all in\-progress multipart uploads on a bucket\. It assumes that you are already following the instructions for [Using the AWS SDK for PHP and Running PHP Examples](UsingTheMPphpAPI.md) and have the AWS SDK for PHP properly installed\. 

The following PHP example demonstrates listing all in\-progress multipart uploads on a bucket\.

```
 require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Aws\S3\S3Client;

$bucket = '*** Your Bucket Name ***';

$s3 = new S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-east-1'
]);

// Retrieve a list of the current multipart uploads.
$result = $s3->listMultipartUploads([
    'Bucket' => $bucket
]);

// Write the list of uploads to the page.
print_r($result->toArray());
```
