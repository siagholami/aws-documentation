# Example walkthroughs \- hosting websites on Amazon S3<a name="hosting-websites-on-s3-examples"></a>

This section provides two examples\. In the first example, you configure a bucket for website hosting, upload a sample index document, and test the website using the Amazon S3 website endpoint for the bucket\. The second example shows how you can use your own domain, such as `example.com`, instead of the Amazon S3 bucket website endpoint, and serve content from an Amazon S3 bucket configured as a website\. The example also shows how Amazon S3 offers the root domain support\.
