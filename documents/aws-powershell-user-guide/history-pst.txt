AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell 1.1.1.0
Collection output from cmdlets is always enumerated to the PowerShell pipeline. Automatic support for pageable service calls. New $AWSHistory shell variable collects service responses and optionally service requests. AWSRegion instances use Region field instead of SystemName to aid pipelining. Remove-S3Bucket supports a -DeleteObjects switch option. Fixed usability issue with Set-AWSCredentials. Initialize-AWSDefaults reports from where it obtained credentials and region data. Stop-EC2Instance accepts Amazon.EC2.Model.Reservation instances as input. Generic List parameter types replaced with array types (T[]). Cmdlets that delete or terminate resources prompt for confirmation prior to deletion. Write-S3Object supports in-line text content to upload to Amazon S3.

AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell 1.0.1.0
The install location of the Tools for Windows PowerShell module has changed so that environments using Windows PowerShell version 3 can take advantage of auto-loading. The module and supporting files are now installed to an AWSPowerShell subfolder beneath AWS ToolsPowerShell. Files from previous versions that exist in the AWS ToolsPowerShell folder are automatically removed by the installer. The PSModulePath for Windows PowerShell (all versions) is updated in this release to contain the parent folder of the module (AWS ToolsPowerShell). For systems with Windows PowerShell version 2, the Start Menu shortcut Windows PowerShell for AWS is updated to import the module from the new location and then run Initialize-AWSDefaults. For systems with Windows PowerShell version 3, the Start Menu shortcut Windows PowerShell for AWS is updated to remove the Import-Module command, leaving just Initialize-AWSDefaults. If you edited your PowerShell profile to perform an Import-Module of the AWSPowerShell.psd1 file, you will need to update it to point to the file's new location (or, if using PowerShell version 3, remove the Import-Module statement as it is no longer needed). As a result of these changes, the Tools for Windows PowerShell module is now listed as an available module when executing Get-Module -ListAvailable. In addition, for users of Windows PowerShell version 3, the execution of any cmdlet exported by the module will automatically load the module in the current PowerShell shell without needing to use Import-Module first. This enables interactive use of the cmdlets on a system with an execution policy that disallows script execution.
