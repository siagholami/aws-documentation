Viewing a Service Quota
Service Quotas makes it easy to look up the value of a particular quota, also referred to as a limit. You can also look up all quotas for a particular service.
To view the quotas for a service


Open the Service Quotas console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/.


In the navigation pane, choose AWS services.


Select a service from the list, or type the name of the service in the search field. For each quota, the console displays its name, applied value, default value, and whether the quota is adjustable. If the applied value is not available, the console displays a dash.


To view additional information about a quota, such as its description and Amazon Resource Name (ARN), choose the quota name.
