**Note**  
Since the AWS CDK is always evolving, some of the code presented in these videos may not work quite the same way it did when the video was recorded\. This is especially true for modules that were under active development at the time\. It's also possible that we've since added a better way to achieve the same result\. Consult this Developer Guide and the [AWS CDK API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html) for up\-to\-date information\.
