AWS Cloud9 creates an associated Amazon EC2 instance and manages that instance's lifecycle (for example, start, stop, and terminate).
You use an existing cloud compute instance or your own server. You manage that instance's or server's lifecycle.


The instance runs on Amazon Linux or Ubuntu Server.
You can use any cloud compute instance that runs Linux, or your own server running Linux.


AWS Cloud9 automatically sets up the instance to start working with AWS Cloud9.
You must manually configure the instance or your own server to work with AWS Cloud9.


AWS Cloud9 automatically sets up the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) on the instance for you to start using.
If you want to use the AWS CLI on the instance or your own server, you must set it up yourself.


The instance has access to hundreds of useful packages, with some common packages already installed and configured, such as Git, Docker, Node.js, and Python.
You might need to download, install, and configure additional packages to complete common tasks.


You maintain the instance, for example by periodically applying system updates.
You maintain the instance or your own server.


When you delete the environment, AWS Cloud9 automatically terminates the associated instance.
When you delete the environment, the instance or your own server remains.
