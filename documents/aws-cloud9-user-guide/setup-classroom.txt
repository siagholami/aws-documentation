  Next Steps 
Step 1: Create an AWS Account and Apply for AWS Educate
In this step, you create an AWS account. Then you apply for AWS Educate. During the application process, you provide AWS Educate with your AWS account ID.
If you already have an AWS account, skip ahead to step 5 of this procedure to apply for AWS Educate. If you're not sure whether your department or institution already has an existing AWS account for you, or whether you should create a new one on your own, check with your department's or institution's AWS account administrator.
If you are already a member of AWS Educate, skip ahead to Step 2: Set Up Your Virtual Classroom for AWS Cloud9.


Go to https://aws.amazon.com.


Choose Sign In to the Console.


Choose Create a new AWS account.


Complete the process by following the on-screen directions. This includes giving AWS your email address and credit card information. You must also use your phone to enter a code that AWS gives you.


After you finish creating the account, AWS sends you a confirmation email. Do not go past this step in this procedure until you get this confirmation.


Go to the Apply for AWS Educate website, at https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/apply/.


Choose Apply for AWS Educate for Educators.


On the Tell us about yourself page, follow the on-screen instructions. This includes giving AWS Educate information such as the educational institution that you work for and your email address there. Leave Promo Code blank.

On the Choose one of the following page, select Click here to enter an AWS Account ID, and then choose Next.


In the box next to Click here to enter an AWS Account ID, enter your AWS account ID, and then choose Next. (To get your AWS account ID, see Finding Your AWS Account ID in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.)


AWS will send you an email with the title Email Verification - AWS Educate Application. Choose the link in that email to confirm your email address, review the AWS Educate program terms and conditions, and complete the application process.


After you complete the application process, AWS will send you an email with the title Thank You for Applying for AWS Educate. This email includes details such as how to check the status of your application and how to contact AWS Educate support with any questions.


After AWS Educate approves your application, AWS will send you an email with the title AWS Educate Application Approved. Note that the approval process might take a few days. Do not go past this step in this procedure until you get this approval.
After you get the approval email, follow the instructions in the email to set your AWS Educate Educator Collaboration Portal (ECP) password, and then sign in to your AWS Educate ECP. After you set your AWS Educate ECP password, store that password in a secure location. The approval email contains information about AWS promotional credit that you can apply to your AWS account. AWS promotional credit can help offset the cost of your individual use of qualifying AWS services, some of which can be used by or with AWS Cloud9. To apply AWS promotional credit to your AWS account, do the following:


With your AWS Educate ECP already open, choose AWS Account.
Note
To return to your AWS Educate ECP, go to the AWS Educate Site Login website, at https://www.awseducate.com/signin/. Enter the email address and password that you used when you initially signed in to your AWS Educate ECP, and then choose Sign In.


In the AWS navigation bar, choose My Account, Billing & Cost Management.


Enter the email address for your AWS account, and then choose Next.
Note
If an email address is already displayed and it's the wrong one, choose Sign in to a different account. Enter the correct email address, and then choose Next.


Enter the password for your AWS account, and then choose Sign in.
Important
Enter the password for your AWS account, not your password for your AWS Educate ECP.


Choose Credits.


For Promo Code, enter the Credit Code from the approval email.


Complete the Security Check, and then choose Redeem.


To see the list of AWS services that qualify for this credit, choose See complete list.
Note
AWS Cloud9 isn't in this list of qualifying AWS services, because there is no additional charge for AWS Cloud9. Instead, AWS automatically applies this credit toward qualifying AWS service usage, some of which can be used by or with AWS Cloud9. For more information, see AWS Cloud9 Pricing.


Step 2: Set Up Your Virtual Classroom for AWS Cloud9
In this step, you use your AWS Educate Educator Collaboration Portal (ECP) to set up a virtual classroom for your students to use AWS Cloud9.


With your AWS Educate ECP already open, choose Classrooms & Credits.
Note

For Upload a List of Email Addresses, choose Next.


Follow the on-screen instructions to download the email address upload template, fill in the template, and then upload your completed template.


After you upload your completed template, choose Submit.
