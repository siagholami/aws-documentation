Identity and access management in AWS Cloud9
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) service that helps an administrator securely control access to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to use resources in AWS services. IAM is an AWS service that you can use with no additional charge.
To use AWS Cloud9 to access AWS, you need an AWS account and AWS credentials. To increase the security of your AWS account, we recommend that you use an IAM user to provide access credentials instead of using your AWS account credentials.
For details about working with IAM, see AWS Identity and Access Management.
For an overview of IAM users and why they are important for the security of your account, see AWS Security Credentials in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
AWS Cloud9 follows the shared responsibility model through the specific Amazon Web Services (AWS) services it supports. For AWS service security information, see the AWS service security documentation page and AWS services that are in scope of AWS compliance efforts by compliance program.
