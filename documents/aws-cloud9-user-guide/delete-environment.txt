Warning
When you delete an environment, AWS Cloud9 deletes the environment permanently. This includes permanently deleting all related settings, user data, and uncommitted code. Deleted environments cannot be recovered.


Sign in to the AWS Cloud9 console as follows:
    If you're the only individual using your AWS account or you are an IAM user in a single AWS account, go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/.
    If your organization uses AWS Single Sign-On (SSO), see your AWS account administrator for sign-in instructions.
    If you're using an AWS Educate Starter Account, see Step 2: Sign in to the AWS Cloud9 Console in Individual Student Signup.
    If you're a student in a classroom, see your instructor for sign-in instructions.


In the top navigation bar, choose the AWS Region where the environment is located.



In the list of environments, for the environment you want to delete, do one of the following.
    Choose the title of the card for the environment. Then choose Delete on the next page.

    Select the card for the environment, and then choose the Delete button.



In the Delete dialog box, type Delete, and then choose Delete.
    EC2 environment
AWS Cloud9 also terminates the Amazon EC2 instance that was connected to that environment.
Note
If account deletion fails, a banner is displayed at the top of the console webpage. Additionally, the card for the environment, if it exists, indicates that environment deletion failed.
    SSH environment
If the environment was connected to an Amazon EC2 instance, AWS Cloud9 doesn't terminate that instance. If you don't terminate that instance later, your AWS account might continue to have ongoing charges for Amazon EC2 related to that instance.


If the environment was an SSH environment, AWS Cloud9 leaves behind a hidden subdirectory on the cloud compute instance or your own server that was connected to that environment. You can now safely delete that subdirectory if you want to. The subdirectory is named .c9. It is located in the Environment path directory that you specified when you created the environment.


If your environment is not displayed in the console, try doing one or more of the following actions to try to display it.
    In the side navigation bar, choose one or more of the following.
      Choose Your environments to display all environments that your AWS entity owns within the selected AWS Region and AWS account.
      Choose Shared with you to display all environments your AWS entity has been invited to within the selected AWS Region and AWS account.
      Choose Account environments to display all environments within the selected AWS Region and AWS account that your AWS entity has permissions to display.

    Choose the previous arrow, next arrow, or page number button to display more environments in the current scope.

    If you think you should be a member of an environment, but the environment is not displayed in the Shared with you list, check with the environment owner.
    In the top navigation bar, choose a different AWS Region.
