Step 6: Run the Function in Production
(Previous step: Step 5: Run or Debug the API Locally)
In this step, you use the IDE to run the function in Lambda itself.
AWS Cloud9 deployed the function to Lambda during Step 2: Create the Lambda Function and API. However, AWS Cloud9 deployed the function before you made the changes in Step 3: Add Code to the Function. That original function was very basic, taking no payload and returning no response. So, you must first deploy your changes to Lambda, and then you can run the deployed function there.


In the Lambda pane of the AWS Resources window, expand Local Functions, expand the MyDateTimeApplication Lambda folder, right-click the myDateTimeFunction Lambda icon, and then choose Deploy.


After the deployment finishes, right-click the myDateTimeFunction Lambda icon, and then choose Run, Run Remote.
Note
You can also do this by choosing the API Gateway (local) list on the run tab from the previous step, and then choosing Lambda (remote).


In the Payload pane on the run tab, be sure one of the payloads from Step 4.1: Run the Function Locally is visible. If it isn't there, add it.


Choose Run, and see the results in the Response area. These should be the same results as in Step 4.1: Run the Function Locally.
