Working with themes in the AWS Cloud9 Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
A theme defines your overall IDE colors. This applies across each AWS Cloud9 development environment associated with your IAM user. As you make changes to your theme, AWS Cloud9 pushes those changes to the cloud, and associates them with your IAM user. AWS Cloud9 also continually scans the cloud for changes to the theme associated with your IAM user, and applies those changes to your current environment.

To change your theme across each environment of yours, in the Themes pane, change the settings you want. To change portions of your theme by using code, choose the your stylesheet link.

You can change the following kinds of overall theme settings on the Preferences tab in the Themes pane.

Theme overrides
Important
AWS Cloud9 no longer supports the feature that allowed users to override IDE themes by updating the styles.css file. Users can continue to view, edit, and save the styles.css file using the editor, but no theme overrides are applied when the AWS Cloud9 IDE loads. 
 If AWS Cloud9 detects that the styles.css file has been modified, the following message is displayed in the IDE:
Support for theme overrides has been discontinued. The contents of this styles.css file will no longer be applied on loading the AWS Cloud9 IDE.
If you need to use style sheets to define themes for the IDE, please contact us directly.
