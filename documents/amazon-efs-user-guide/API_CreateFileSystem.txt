CreateFileSystem
Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller's AWS account with the specified creation token, this operation does the following:
 Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state creating.
 Returns with the description of the created file system.
Otherwise, this operation returns a FileSystemAlreadyExists error with the ID of the existing file system.
Note
For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the creation token.
The idempotent operation allows you to retry a CreateFileSystem call without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file system, the client can learn of its existence from the FileSystemAlreadyExists error.
Note
The CreateFileSystem call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still creating. You can check the file system creation status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which among other things returns the file system state.
This operation also takes an optional PerformanceMode parameter that you choose for your file system. We recommend generalPurpose performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created. For more information, see Amazon EFS: Performance Modes.
After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state to available, at which point you can create one or more mount targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see CreateMountTarget. You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC by using the mount target. For more information, see Amazon EFS: How it Works. 
This operation requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem action.

URI Request Parameters
The request does not use any URI parameters.
Request Body
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 CreationToken  
A string of up to 64 ASCII characters. Amazon EFS uses this to ensure idempotent creation.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
Pattern: . 
Required: Yes
 Encrypted  
A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying CreateFileSystem:KmsKeyId for an existing AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). If you don't specify a CMK, then the default CMK for Amazon EFS, /aws/elasticfilesystem, is used to protect the encrypted file system. 
Type: Boolean
Required: No
 KmsKeyId  
The ID of the AWS KMS CMK to be used to protect the encrypted file system. This parameter is only required if you want to use a nondefault CMK. If this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for Amazon EFS is used. This ID can be in one of the following formats:
 Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
 ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
 Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example alias/projectKey1.
 Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1.
If KmsKeyId is specified, the CreateFileSystem:Encrypted parameter must be set to true.
EFS accepts only symmetric CMKs. You cannot use asymmetric CMKs with EFS file systems.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 2048.
Pattern: ^([0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}|alias/[a-zA-Z0-9/_-]|(arn:aws[-a-z]*:kms:[a-z0-9-]:\d{12}:((key/[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12})|(alias/[a-zA-Z0-9/_-]))))$ 
Required: No
 PerformanceMode  
The performance mode of the file system. We recommend generalPurpose performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created.
Type: String
Valid Values:generalPurpose | maxIO 
Required: No
 ProvisionedThroughputInMibps  
The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file system that you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required if ThroughputMode is set to provisioned. The upper limit for throughput is 1024 MiB/s. You can get this limit increased by contacting AWS Support. For more information, see Amazon EFS Limits That You Can Increase in the Amazon EFS User Guide. 
Type: Double
Valid Range: Minimum value of 1.0.
Required: No
 Tags  
A value that specifies to create one or more tags associated with the file system. Each tag is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file system on creation by including a "Key":"Name","Value":"{value}" key-value pair.
Type: Array of Tag objects
Required: No
 ThroughputMode  
The throughput mode for the file system to be created. There are two throughput modes to choose from for your file system: bursting and provisioned. If you set ThroughputMode to provisioned, you must also set a value for ProvisionedThroughPutInMibps. You can decrease your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes as long as it’s been more than 24 hours since the last decrease or throughput mode change. For more, see Specifying Throughput with Provisioned Mode in the Amazon EFS User Guide. 
Type: String
Valid Values:bursting | provisioned 
Required: No

Errors
BadRequest 
Returned if the request is malformed or contains an error such as an invalid parameter value or a missing required parameter.

HTTP Status Code: 503
InternalServerError 
Returned if an error occurred on the server side.
HTTP Status Code: 500
ThroughputLimitExceeded 
Returned if the throughput mode or amount of provisioned throughput can't be changed because the throughput limit of 1024 MiB/s has been reached.
HTTP Status Code: 400
