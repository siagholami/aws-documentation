Managing file system tags
You can include file system tags when you create your Amazon EFS file system. You can also create new tags, update values of existing tags, or delete tags associated with a file system anytime after it is created. 
Using the console
The console lists existing tags associated with a file system. You can add new tags, change values of existing tags, or delete existing tags.
To add tags, change tag values, or delete tags (console)


Open the Amazon Elastic File System console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/.


Choose File systems.


Choose the file system that you want to manage tags for.


On the File system details page, choose Tags.


To edit existing tags or create new tags, choose Manage tags.


In the Manage tags dialog box, you can do the following:
    Edit a tag value - Choose the tag value, edit the value, and then choose Save.
    Add a new tag - Choose Add tag, enter the key-value pair, and choose Save.
    Remove an existing tag - Choose Remove tag next to the tag you want to delete. Then choose Save, or choose Undo to revert the deletion.



Using the CLI
The AWS CLI commands for managing tags, and the equivalent Amazon EFS API actions, are listed in the following table.

To create file system tags (AWS CLI)
 Create tags by using the Amazon EFS https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/efs/tag-resource.html CLI command (the corresponding API operation is TagResource). The following example command creates a new Department tag that has a value of Business Intelligence to the file system.
$  aws efs tag-resource \
  --resource-id File-System-Id \
  --tags Key=Department,Value="Business Intelligence" \
  --region aws-region \
If the command is successful, the AWS CLI doesn't provide a response.
To create an access point tag
 You can create a tag for an EFS access point using the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/efs/tag-resource.html CLI command.
$  aws efs tag-resource \
  --resource-id Access-Point-Id \
  --tags Key=AccessTeam,Value="Data_Lake" \
  --region aws-region \
To retrieve all tags associated with a file system
 Retrieve a list of tags associated with a file system by using the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/efs/list-tags-for-resource.html CLI command (the corresponding API operation is ListTagsForResource), as shown following.
$  aws efs list-tags-for-resource \
  --resource-id File-System-Id \
  --region aws-region \
Amazon EFS returns these descriptions as JSON. The following is an example of tags returned by the DescribeTags operation. It shows a file system as having three tags.
{
      "Tags": [
         {
            "Key": "Name",
            "Value": "Test File System"            
         },
         {
            "Key": "developer",
            "Value": "rhoward"
         },
         {
            "Key": "Department",
            "Value": "Business Intelligence"
         }
      ]
  }
To delete one or more tags associated with an EFS resource
 Delete a file system's tags using the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/efs/untag-resource.html CLI command (the corresponding API operation is UntagResource). The following command removes the tag keys test1 and test2 from the tag list of the specified file system. You specify the key of each tag that you want to delete in the request.
$ aws efs untag-resource\
  --resource-id fs-c5a1446c \
  --tag-keys "test1" "test2" \
  --region us-west-2 \
If the command is successful, the AWS CLI doesn't provide a response.
To delete, or untag, an EFS access point
 Delete an EFS access point's tag using the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/efs/untag-resource.html CLI command (the corresponding API operation is UntagResource) as follows.
$  aws efs untag-resource \
  --resource-id Access-Point-Id \
  --tags Key=AccessTeam,Value="Data_Lake" \
  --region us-west-2 \
