Creating file system policies
You can create a file system policy using the Amazon EFS console or using the AWS CLI. You can also create a file system policy programmatically using AWS SDKs or the Amazon EFS API directly. To learn more about file system policies and see examples, see Using IAM to Control NFS Access to Amazon EFS.
Creating a file system policy (console)


Open the Amazon Elastic File System console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/.


Choose File Systems.


On the File systems page, choose the file system that you want to edit or create a file system policy for. The details page for that file system is displayed.


Choose File system policy, then choose Edit. The File system policy page appears.



In Policy options, you can choose any combination of the following preconfigured policies:
    Prevent root access by default
    Enforce read-only access by default
    Enforce in-transit encryption for all clients


If you choose a preconfigured policy, the policy JSON object is displayed in the Policy editor panel.

Use the Policy editor to customize a preconfigured policy or to create your own policy. When you use the editor, the preconfigured policy options become unavailable. To undo your policy changes, choose Clear.

When you clear the editor, the preconfigured policies become available once again.

After you complete editing or creating the policy, choose Save. The details page for the file system is displayed, showing the policy in File system policy.

Creating a file system policy (CLI)
In the following example, the put-file-system-policy CLI command creates a file system policy that allows all IAM principals read-only access to the EFS file system. The equivalent API command is PutFileSystemPolicy.
aws efs put-file-system-policy --file-system-id fs-01234567 --policy '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "1",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "elasticfilesystem:ClientMount"
            ],
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            }
        }                                                                                                 
    ]
}'
{
    "FileSystemId": "fs-01234567",
    "Policy": "{
    "Version" : "2012-10-17",
    "Id" : "1",
    "Statement" : [
        {
           "Sid" : "efs-statement-7c8d8687-1c94-4fdc-98b7-111122223333",
           "Effect" : "Allow",
           "Principal" : {
              "AWS" : "*"
           },
           "Action" : [ 
              "elasticfilesystem:ClientMount" 
           ],
           "Resource" : "arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-east-2:111122223333:file-system/fs-01234567"
           } 
        ]
    }
}
