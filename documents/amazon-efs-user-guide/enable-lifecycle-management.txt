Using lifecycle management
Lifecycle management is automatically enabled with a 30 days since last access policy when you create an Amazon EFS file system using the service recommended settings. For more information, see Step 1: Create Your Amazon EFS File System.
If you create a new file system with customized settings, you can enable Lifecycle management in Step 1 of the configuration wizard. For more information, see Step 1: Configure file system settings.
You can start, stop, and modify lifecycle management using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, described as follows.
