DescribeLifecycleConfiguration
Returns the current LifecycleConfiguration object for the specified Amazon EFS file system. EFS lifecycle management uses the LifecycleConfiguration object to identify which files to move to the EFS Infrequent Access (IA) storage class. For a file system without a LifecycleConfiguration object, the call returns an empty array in the response.
This operation requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:DescribeLifecycleConfiguration operation.
