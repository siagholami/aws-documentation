Deleting an Amazon EFS file system
File system deletion is a destructive action that you can't undo. You lose the file system and any data you have in it. Any data that you delete from a file system is gone, and you can't restore the data. When users delete data from a file system, that data is immediately rendered unusable. EFS force-overwrites the data in an eventual manner.
Important
You should always unmount a file system before you delete it.
Using the Console
To delete a file system


Open the Amazon Elastic File System console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/.


Select the file system that you want to delete in the File systems page.


Choose Delete.


In the Delete file system dialog box, enter the file system id shown, and choose Confirm to confirm the delete.



The console simplifies the file system deletion for you. First it deletes the associated mount targets, and then it deletes the file system.
Using the CLI
Before you can use the AWS CLI command to delete a file system, you must delete all of the mount targets and access points created for the file system. 
For example AWS CLI commands, see Step 4: Clean Up.
