# Hyperparameter Tuning with Amazon SageMaker RL<a name="sagemaker-rl-tuning"></a>

You can run a hyperparameter tuning job to optimize hyperparameters for Amazon SageMaker RL\. The Roboschool example in the sample notebooks at [https://github\.com/awslabs/amazon\-sagemaker\-examples/tree/master/'reinforcement\-learning](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/reinforcement_learning) shows how you can do this with RL Coach\. The launcher script shows how you can abstract parameters from the Coach preset file and optimize them\.
