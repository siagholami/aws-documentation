# How Image Classification Works<a name="IC-HowItWorks"></a>

The image classification algorithm takes an image as input and classifies it into one of the output categories\. Deep learning has revolutionized the image classification domain and has achieved great performance\. Various deep learning networks such as ResNet \[1\], DenseNet, inception, and so on, have been developed to be highly accurate for image classification\. At the same time, there have been efforts to collect labeled image data that are essential for training these networks\. ImageNet\[2\] is one such large dataset that has more than 11 million images with about 11,000 categories\. Once a network is trained with ImageNet data, it can then be used to generalize with other datasets as well, by simple re\-adjustment or fine\-tuning\. In this transfer learning approach, a network is initialized with weights \(in this example, trained on ImageNet\), which can be later fine\-tuned for an image classification task in a different dataset\. 

Image classification in Amazon SageMaker can be run in two modes: full training and transfer learning\. In full training mode, the network is initialized with random weights and trained on user data from scratch\. In transfer learning mode, the network is initialized with pre\-trained weights and just the top fully connected layer is initialized with random weights\. Then, the whole network is fine\-tuned with new data\. In this mode, training can be achieved even with a smaller dataset\. This is because the network is already trained and therefore can be used in cases without sufficient training data\.
