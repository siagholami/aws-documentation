Create a Labeling Job
You can create a labeling job in the Amazon SageMaker console and by using an AWS SDK in your preferred language to run CreateLabelingJob. After a labeling job has been created, you can track worker metrics (for private workforces) and your labeling job status using CloudWatch.
After you have chosen your task type, use the topics on this page to learn how to create a labeling job. If you are a new Ground Truth user, we recommend that you start by walking through the demo in Getting started.
