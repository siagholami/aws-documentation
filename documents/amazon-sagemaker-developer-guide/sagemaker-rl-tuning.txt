Hyperparameter Tuning with Amazon SageMaker RL
You can run a hyperparameter tuning job to optimize hyperparameters for Amazon SageMaker RL. The Roboschool example in the sample notebooks at https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/'reinforcement-learning shows how you can do this with RL Coach. The launcher script shows how you can abstract parameters from the Coach preset file and optimize them.
