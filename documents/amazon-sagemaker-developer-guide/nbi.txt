Use Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances
An Amazon SageMaker notebook instance is a machine learning (ML) compute instance running the Jupyter Notebook App. SageMaker manages creating the instance and related resources. Use Jupyter notebooks in your notebook instance to prepare and process data, write code to train models, deploy models to SageMaker hosting, and test or validate your models.
SageMaker also provides sample notebooks that contain complete code walkthroughs. These walkthroughs show how to use SageMaker to perform common machine learning tasks. For more information, see Example Notebooks.
