Use Your Own Inference Code
You can use Amazon SageMaker to interact with Docker containers and run your own inference code in one of two ways:
 To use your own inference code with a persistent endpoint to get one prediction at a time, use SageMaker hosting services.
 To use your own inference code to get predictions for an entire dataset, use SageMaker batch transform.
