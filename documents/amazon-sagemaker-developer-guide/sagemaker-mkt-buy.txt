Use Algorithm and Model Package Resources
You can create algorithms and model packages as resources in your Amazon SageMaker account, and you can find and subscribe to algorithms and model packages on AWS Marketplace.
Use algorithms to:
 Run training jobs. For information, see Use an Algorithm to Run a Training Job.
 Run hyperparameter tuning jobs. For information, see Use an Algorithm to Run a Hyperparameter Tuning Job.
 Create model packages. After you use an algorithm resource to run a training job or a hyperparameter tuning job, you can use the model artifacts that these jobs output along with the algorithm to create a model package. For information, see Create a Model Package Resource.
Note
If you subscribe to an algorithm on AWS Marketplace, you must create a model package before you can use it to get inferences by creating hosted endpoint or running a batch transform job.

Use model packages to:
 Create models that you can use to get real-time inference or run batch transform jobs. For information, see Use a Model Package to Create a Model.
 Create hosted endpoints to get real-time inference. For information, see Step 6.1: Deploy the Model to SageMaker Hosting Services.
 Create batch transform jobs. For information, see Step 6.2: Deploy the Model with Batch Transform.
