Jupyter notebooks contain optional metadata that you can access through the Amazon SageMaker UI.
To view the notebook metadata


In the left sidebar, choose the Notebook Tools icon ( ).


Open the Advanced Tools section.


The metadata should look similar to the following.
{
    "instance_type": "ml.t3.medium",
    "kernelspec": {
        "display_name": "Python 3 (Data Science)",
        "language": "python",
        "name": "python3__SAGEMAKER_INTERNAL__arn:aws:sagemaker:us-west-2:<acct-id>:image/datascience-1.0"
    },
    "language_info": {
        "codemirror_mode": {
            "name": "ipython",
            "version": 3
        },
        "file_extension": ".py",
        "mimetype": "text/x-python",
        "name": "python",
        "nbconvert_exporter": "python",
        "pygments_lexer": "ipython3",
        "version": "3.7.6"
    }
}
Get App Metadata
When you create a notebook in Amazon SageMaker Studio, the App metadata is written to a file named resource-metadata.json in the folder /opt/ml/metadata/. You can get the App metadata by opening an Image terminal from within the notebook. The metadata gives you the following information, which includes the SageMaker image and instance type the notebook runs in:
 AppType – KernelGateway 
 DomainId – Same as the StudioID
 UserProfileName – The profile name of the current user
 ResourceArn – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the App, which includes the instance type
 ResourceName – The name of the SageMaker image
The following screenshot shows the menu from a Studio notebook.

To get the App metadata


In the center of the notebook menu, choose the Launch Terminal icon ( ). This opens a terminal in the SageMaker image that the notebook runs in.


Run the following commands to display the contents of the resource-metadata.json file.


cd /opt/ml/metadata/
   cat resource-metadata.json
The file should look similar to the following.
{
    "AppType": "KernelGateway",
    "DomainId": "d-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "UserProfileName": "profile-name",
    "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:sagemaker:us-east-2:account-id:app/d-xxxxxxxxxxxx/profile-name/KernelGateway/datascience--1-0-ml-t3-medium",
    "ResourceName": "datascience--1-0-ml"
}
