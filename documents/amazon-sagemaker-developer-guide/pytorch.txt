Use PyTorch with Amazon SageMaker
You can use Amazon SageMaker to train and deploy a model using custom PyTorch code. The SageMaker Python SDK PyTorch estimators and models and the SageMaker open-source PyTorch container make writing a PyTorch script and running it in SageMaker easier.
What do you want to do?
I want to train a custom PyTorch model in SageMaker.
For a sample Jupyter notebook, see the PyTorch example notebook in the Amazon SageMaker Examples GitHub repository.
For documentation, see Train a Model with PyTorch.
I have a PyTorch model that I trained in SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a hosted endpoint.
For more information, see Deploy PyTorch models.
I have a PyTorch model that I trained outside of SageMaker, and I want to deploy it to a SageMaker endpoint
For more information, see Deploy Endpoints from Model Data.
I want to see the API documentation for Amazon SageMaker Python SDK PyTorch classes.
For more information, see PyTorch Classes.
I want to find the SageMaker PyTorch container repository.
For more information, see SageMaker PyTorch Container GitHub repository.
I want to find information about PyTorch versions supported by AWS Deep Learning Containers.
For more information, see Available Deep Learning Container Images.
