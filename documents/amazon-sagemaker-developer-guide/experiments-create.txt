Create an Amazon SageMaker Experiment
Create an Amazon SageMaker experiment to track your SageMaker training, processing, and transform jobs.
The following procedure shows you how to create a SageMaker experiment for a SageMaker training, processing, or transform job. Steps labeled as (Studio) describe how to view the experiment in Amazon SageMaker Studio. You don't have to run the experiment in Studio to view the experiment in Studio.
For a tutorial that shows this functionality in an existing SageMaker Studio notebook, see Track and Compare Tutorial.

Import the sys module to install the SDKs.

import sys

(Optional) The Amazon SageMaker Python SDK, comes preinstalled in SageMaker Studio. If you plan to run your code outside Studio, install the SageMaker Python SDK.

!{sys.executable} -m pip install sagemaker

Install the SageMaker Experiments Python SDK.

!{sys.executable} -m pip install sagemaker-experiments

Import modules.

```
   import time
   from time import strftime
import sagemaker
from smexperiments.experiment import Experiment
   from smexperiments.trial import Trial
   from smexperiments.trial_component import TrialComponent
   from smexperiments.tracker import Tracker
   ```

Get the execution role and create the SageMaker session.

role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
   sm_sess = sagemaker.session.Session()

Create a SageMaker experiment. The experiment name must be unique in your account.
Note
The tags parameter is optional. You can search for the tag using Studio, the SageMaker console, and the SDK. Tags can also be applied to trials and trial components. For information on how to search tags using Studio, see Search by Tag.

create_date = strftime("%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S")
   demo_experiment = Experiment.create(experiment_name = "DEMO-{}".format(create_date),
                                       description = "Demo experiment",
                                       tags = [{'Key': 'my-experiments', 'Value': 'demo1'}])

(Studio) To view the experiment in SageMaker Studio, in the left sidebar, choose the SageMaker Experiment List icon (  ) to display the experiments browser.

After the code runs, the experiment list contains the new experiment. It might take a moment for the list to refresh and display the experiment. The filter on the experiment tag is also displayed. Only experiments that have a matching tag are displayed. Your list should look similar to the following:


Create a trial for the experiment. The trial name must be unique in your account.

demo_trial = Trial.create(trial_name = "DEMO-{}".format(create_date),
                             experiment_name = demo_experiment.experiment_name,
                             tags = [{'Key': 'my-experiments', 'Value': 'demo1'}])


(Studio) In the experiment list, double-click the experiment to display a list of the trials in the experiment (this example has one trial). Your list should look similar to the following:



Create a trial component as part of the trial. The trial component is the SageMaker job.


Add the ExperimentConfig parameter to the appropriate method. The SageMaker jobs listed in the following table are supported.  
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
The following examples are for a training job. The Tags parameter adds a tag to the trial component. ExperimentName isn't specified because the trial was associated with the experiment when the trial was created in an earlier step.
Using the SageMaker Python SDK
```
   sagemaker.estimator.Estimator(
       ...,
       sagemaker_session = sm_sess,
       tags = [{'Key': 'my-experiments', 'Value': 'demo2'}])
estimator.fit(
       ...,
       experiment_config = {
           # "ExperimentName"
           "TrialName" : demo_trial.trial_name,
           "TrialComponentDisplayName" : "TrainingJob",
       })
   ```
Using Boto3
create_training_job(
       ...,
       "ExperimentConfig": {
           # "ExperimentName"
           "TrialName" : demo_trial.trial_name,
           "TrialComponentDisplayName" : "TrainingJob",
       },
       "Tags": [{'Key': 'my-experiments', 'Value': 'demo2'}])


(Studio) In the trial list, double-click the trial to display a list of the components in the trial (this example has one trial). Your list should look similar to the following:
