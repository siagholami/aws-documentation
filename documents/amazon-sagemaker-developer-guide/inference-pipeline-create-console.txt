Create a Pipeline Model
To create a pipeline model that can be deployed to an endpoint or used for a batch transform job, use the Amazon SageMaker console or the CreateModel operation. 
To create an inference pipeline (console)


Open the Amazon SageMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/.


Choose Models, and then choose Create models from the Inference group. 


On the Create model page, provide a model name, choose an IAM role, and, if you want to use a private VPC, specify VPC values. 



To add information about the containers in the inference pipeline, choose Add container, then choose Next.


Complete the fields for each container in the order that you want to execute them, up to the maximum of five. Complete the Container input options, , Location of inference code image, and, optionally, Location of model artifacts, Container host name, and Environmental variables fields. .



The MyInferencePipelineModel page summarizes the settings for the containers that provide input for the model. If you provided the environment variables in a corresponding container definition, SageMaker shows them in the Environment variables field.
