To onboard to Studio using *Quick start*


Open the SageMaker console.


Choose Amazon SageMaker Studio at the top left of the page.


On the Amazon SageMaker Studio page, under Get started, choose Quick start.


For User name, keep the default name or create a new name. The name can be up to 63 characters. Valid characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and - (hyphen). 


For Execution role, choose an option from the role selector.


If you choose Enter a custom IAM role ARN, the role must have the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess policy attached.
If you choose Create a new role, the Create an IAM role dialog opens:
    For S3 buckets you specify, specify additional S3 buckets that users of your notebooks can access. If you don't want to add access to more buckets, choose None.
    Choose Create role. SageMaker creates a new IAM AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionPolicy role with the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess policy attached.

Choose Submit.

On the Amazon SageMaker Studio Control Panel, under Studio Summary, wait for Status to change to Ready.
When Status is Ready, the user name that you specified is enabled and chosen. The Add user and Delete user buttons, and the Open Studio link are also enabled.
