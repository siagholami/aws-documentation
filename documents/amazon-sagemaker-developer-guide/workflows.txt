Following are the supported workflow technologies. 
 Airflow Workflows: Amazon SageMaker APIs to export configurations for creating and managing Airflow workflows.
 Kubernetes Orchestration : SageMaker custom operators for your Kubernetes cluster, as well as custom components for Kubeflow Pipelines.
 AWS Step Functions: Create multi-step machine learning workflows in Python that orchestrate SageMaker infrastructure without having to provision your resources separately.
