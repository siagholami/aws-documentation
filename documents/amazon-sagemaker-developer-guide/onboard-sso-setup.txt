On the Amazon SageMaker Studio page, under Get started, choose Standard setup.


Choose the set up an account link to open the AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) console.


Choose Enable AWS SSO, and then choose Create AWS organization.


When your organization has been created, the AWS SSO dashboard opens. AWS also sends you email to verify the email address associated with the organization.


To add a user to your AWS SSO organization, in the navigation pane, choose Users.


On the Users page, choose Add user. Under User details, specify all required fields. For Password, choose Send an email to the user.


Choose Next: Groups and then Add user. AWS sends an email to the user inviting them to create a password and activate their AWS SSO account.


To add more users, repeat steps 4 through 6.


Return to SageMaker Studio to continue to onboard using AWS SSO authentication.
