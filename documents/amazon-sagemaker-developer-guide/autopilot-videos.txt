Videos: Use Autopilot to automate and explore the machine learning process
Here is a video series that provides a tour of Amazon SageMaker Autopilot capabilities using Studio. They show how to start an AutoML job, analyze and preprocess data, how to do feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization on candidate models, and how to visualize and compare the resulting model metrics.

Amazon SageMaker Autopilot walkthrough
This video walks you through an end to end demo where we first build a binary classification model automatically with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot. We see how candidate models have been built and optimized using auto-generated notebooks. We also look at the top candidates with SageMaker Experiments. Finally, we deploy the top candidate (based on XGBoost), and configure data capture with SageMaker Model Monitor.
