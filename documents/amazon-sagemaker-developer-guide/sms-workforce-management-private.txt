Manage a Private Workforce (Amazon Cognito)
After you have created a private workforce using Amazon Cognito, you can create and manage work teams using the Amazon SageMaker console and API operations.
You can do the following using either the SageMaker console or Amazon Cognito console. 
 Add and delete work teams.
 Add workers to your workforce and one or more work teams.
 Disable or remove workers from your workforce and one or more workteams. If you add workers to a workforce using the Amazon Cognito console, you must use the same console to remove the worker from the workforce.
You can restrict access to tasks to workers at specific IP addresses using the SageMaker API. For more information, see Manage Private Workforce Using the Amazon SageMaker API.
