Developers can use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), Amazon Chime API, or AWS SDK to integrate chatbots with Amazon Chime\. Chatbots let you use the power of Amazon Lex, AWS Lambda, and other AWS services to streamline common tasks with intelligent conversational interfaces that are accessible to users in Amazon Chime chat rooms\.

If you're an Amazon Chime Enterprise account administrator, you can use chatbots to allow users to perform such tasks as:
+ Querying their internal systems for information\.
+ Automating tasks\.
+ Receiving notifications for critical issues\.
+ Creating support tickets\.

For more information about Amazon Chime Enterprise accounts, see [Managing your Amazon Chime accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/manage-chime-account.html) in the *Amazon Chime Administrator Guide*\.

If you administer an Amazon Chime Enterprise account, you can create up to 10 chatbots for integration with Amazon Chime\. Chatbots can be used only in chat rooms created by members of your account\. Only chat room administrators can add chatbots to a chat room\. After a chatbot is added to a chat room, members of the chat room can interact with the bot using commands provided by the bot creator\. For more information, see [Using chatbots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ug/chat-bots.html) in the *Amazon Chime User Guide*\.

Linux and macOS users can build a sample custom chatbot\. For more information, see [Build custom chatbots for Amazon Chime](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/business-productivity/build-custom-chat-bots-for-amazon-chime/)\.
