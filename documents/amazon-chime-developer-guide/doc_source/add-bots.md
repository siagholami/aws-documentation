# Step 3: Add the chatbot to an Amazon Chime chat room<a name="add-bots"></a>

Only a chat room administrator can add a chatbot to a chat room\. They use the chatbot email address created in [Step 1](integrate-bots.md)\.

**To add a chatbot to a chat room**

1. Open the Amazon Chime desktop client or web application\.

1. Choose the gear icon in the upper\-right corner, and choose **Manage webhooks and bots**\.

1. Choose **Add bot**\.

1. For **Email address**, enter the bot email address\.

1. Choose **Add**\.

The bot name appears in the chat room roster\. If there are additional instructions necessary to add a chatbot to a chat room, provide the instructions to the chat room administrator\.

After the chatbot is added to the chat room, provide the chatbot commands to your chat room users\. One way to do this is to program your chatbot to send command help to the chat room when it receives the chat room invite\. AWS also recommends creating a help command for your chatbot users to use\.
