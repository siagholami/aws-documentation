Before you can build real\-time meeting clients with the Amazon Chime SDK, you must integrate your client application with an Amazon Chime SDK client library\. The following client libraries are available:
+ [Amazon Chime SDK client library for JavaScript](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-js) \([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-chime-sdk-js)\) – A JavaScript library with TypeScript type definitions that helps you build Amazon Chime SDK applications in WebRTC\-enabled browsers\.
+ [Amazon Chime SDK client library for iOS](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-ios) – A Swift library that helps you build Amazon Chime SDK applications on supported iOS devices\.
+ [Amazon Chime SDK client library for Android](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-android) – A Kotlin library that helps you build Amazon Chime SDK applications on supported Android devices\.

 To learn how to integrate your client application with the Amazon Chime SDK, see the instructions in the client library `README.md`\. Use the demos to learn how to build specific media components for your application\.
