Install AWS ParallelCluster using Python and pip on Windows
The Python Software Foundation provides installers for Windows that include pip.
To install Python and pip (Windows)


Download the Python Windows x86-64 installer from the downloads page of Python.org.


Run the installer.


Choose Add Python 3 to PATH.


Choose Install Now.


The installer installs Python in your user folder and adds its program folders to your user path.
To install AWS ParallelCluster with pip3 (Windows)
If you use Python version 3, we recommend that you use the pip3 command.


Open the Command Prompt from the Start menu.


Use the following commands to verify that Python and pip are both installed correctly.


C:\>py --version
   Python 3.8.5
   C:\>pip3 --version
   pip 20.2.3 from c:\python38\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.8)

Install AWS ParallelCluster using pip.

C:\>pip3 install aws-parallelcluster

Verify that AWS ParallelCluster is installed correctly.

C:\>pcluster version
   2.9.1
To upgrade to the latest version, run the installation command again.
C:\>pip3 install --user --upgrade aws-parallelcluster
Add the AWS ParallelCluster executable to your command line path
After installing AWS ParallelCluster with pip, add the pcluster program to your operating system's PATH environment variable.
You can find where the pcluster program is installed by running the following command.
C:\>where pcluster
C:\Python38\Scripts\pcluster.exe
If that command does not return any results, then you must add the path manually. Use the command line or Windows Explorer to discover where it is installed on your computer. Typical paths include:
 Python 3 and pip3 – C:\Python38\Scripts\
 Python 3 and pip3 --user option – %APPDATA%\Python\Python38\Scripts
Note
Folder names that include version numbers can vary. The preceding examples show Python38. Replace as needed with the version number that you are using.
To modify your PATH variable (Windows)


Press the Windows key and enter environment variables.


Choose Edit environment variables for your account.


Choose PATH, and then choose Edit.


Add the path to the Variable value* field. For example: C:\new\path***


Choose OK twice to apply the new settings.


Close any running command prompts and reopen the command prompt window.
