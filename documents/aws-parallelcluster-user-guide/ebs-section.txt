 ebs_volume_id
Defines Amazon EBS volume configuration settings for volumes that are mounted on the head node and shared via NFS to the compute nodes.
The format is [ebs ebs-name]. ebs-name must start with a letter, contain no more than 30 characters, and only contain letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).

shared_dir
Specifies the path where the shared Amazon EBS volume is mounted.
This parameter is required when using multiple Amazon EBS volumes.
When using one (1) Amazon EBS volume, this option overwrites the shared_dir that is specified under the [cluster] section. In the following example, the volume mounts to /vol1.
shared_dir = vol1
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
ebs_snapshot_id
Defines the Amazon EBS snapshot Id, if you are using a snapshot as the source for the volume.
The default value is NONE.
ebs_snapshot_id = snap-xxxxx
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
volume_type
Specifies the Amazon EBS volume type of the volume that you want to launch.
Valid options are:
 gp2
 io1
 st1
 sc1
The default value is gp2.
volume_type = io1
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
volume_size
Specifies the size of the volume to be created, in GiB (if not using a snapshot).
The default value is 20.
volume_size = 20
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
volume_iops
Defines the number of IOPS for io1-type volumes.
The default value is 100.
volume_iops = 200
Update policy: This setting can be changed during an update.
encrypted
Specifies whether the Amazon EBS volume is encrypted. Note: Do not use with snapshots.
The default value is false.
encrypted = false
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
ebs_kms_key_id
Specifies a custom AWS KMS key to use for encryption.
This parameter must be used together with encrypted = true. It also must have a custom ec2_iam_role.
For more information, see Disk encryption with a custom KMS Key.
ebs_kms_key_id = xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
ebs_volume_id
Defines the volume Id of an existing Amazon EBS volume to attach to the head node.
The default value is NONE.
ebs_volume_id = vol-xxxxxx
Update policy: If this setting is changed, the update is not allowed.
