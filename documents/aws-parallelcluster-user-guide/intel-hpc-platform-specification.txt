Intel HPC Platform Specification
AWS ParallelCluster is compliant with the Intel HPC Platform Specification. The Intel HPC Platform Specification provides a set of compute, fabric, memory, storage, and software requirements to help achieve a high standard of quality and compatibility with HPC workloads. For more information, see Intel HPC Platform Specification and Applications Verified Compatible with the Intel HPC Platform Specification.
To be compliant with the Intel HPC Platform Specification, the following requirements must be met:
 The operating system must be CentOS 7 (base_os= centos7).
 The instance type for the compute nodes must have an Intel CPU and at least 64 GB of memory. For the c5 family of instance types, this means that the instance type must be at least a c5.9xlarge (compute_instance_type= c5.9xlarge).
 The head node must have at least 200 GB of storage.
 The End User License Agreement for Intel Parallel Studio must be accepted (enable_intel_hpc_platform= true).
 Each compute node must have at least 80 GB of storage (compute_root_volume_size= 80).
The storage can be local or on a network (NFS shared from the head node, Amazon EBS or Amazon FSx for Lustre), and it can be shared.
