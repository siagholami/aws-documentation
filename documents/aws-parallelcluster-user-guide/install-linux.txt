Install AWS ParallelCluster on Linux
You can install AWS ParallelCluster and its dependencies on most Linux distributions by using pip, a package manager for Python. First, determine if Python and pip are installed:

To determine if your version of Linux includes Python and pip, run pip --version.

$ pip --version
If you have pip installed, go on to the Install AWS ParallelCluster with pip topic. Otherwise, continue with Step 2.

To determine if Python is installed, run python --version.

$ python --version
If you have Python 3 version 3.6 or Python 2 version 2.7 installed, go on to the Install AWS ParallelCluster with pip topic. Otherwise, install Python, and then return to this procedure to install pip.


Install pip by using the script that the Python Packaging Authority provides. 


Use the curl command to download the installation script.


$ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

Run the script with Python to download and install the latest version of pip and other required support packages.

$ python get-pip.py --user
or
$ python3 get-pip.py --user
When you include the --user switch, the script installs pip to the path ~/.local/bin.


To ensure that the folder that contains pip is part of your PATH variable, do the following:


Find your shell's profile script in your user folder. If you're not sure which shell you have, run basename $SHELL.
$ ls -a ~
  .  ..  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  Desktop  Documents  Downloads
   Bash – .bash_profile, .profile, or .bash_login
   Zsh – .zshrc
   Tcsh – .tcshrc, .cshrc or .login


Add an export command at the end of your profile script that's similar to the following example.
export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
The export command inserts the path, which is ~/.local/bin in this example, at the front of the existing PATH variable.


To put these changes into effect, reload the profile into your current session.
$ source ~/.bash_profile


Verify that pip is installed correctly.


$ pip3 --version
   pip 20.2.3 from ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)

 Installing Python on Linux
Install AWS ParallelCluster with pip
Use pip to install AWS ParallelCluster.
$ python3 -m pip install aws-parallelcluster --upgrade --user
When you use the --user switch, pip installs AWS ParallelCluster to ~/.local/bin. 
Verify that AWS ParallelCluster installed correctly.
$ pcluster version
2.9.1
To upgrade to the latest version, run the installation command again.
$ python3 -m pip install aws-parallelcluster --upgrade --user
Add the AWS ParallelCluster executable to your command line path
After installing with pip, you might need to add the pcluster executable to your operating system's PATH environment variable.
To verify the folder in which pip installed AWS ParallelCluster, run the following command.
$ which pcluster
/home/username/.local/bin/pcluster
If you omitted the --user switch when you installed AWS ParallelCluster, the executable might be in the bin folder of your Python installation. If you don't know where Python is installed, run this command.
$ which python
/usr/local/bin/python
Note that the output might be the path to a symlink, not to the actual executable. To see where the symlink points, run ls -al.
$ ls -al $(which python)
/usr/local/bin/python -> ~/.local/Python/3.6/bin/python3.6
If this is the same folder that you added to the path in step 3 in Installing AWS ParallelCluster, you're done with the installation. Otherwise, you must perform steps 3a – 3c again, adding this additional folder to the path.
