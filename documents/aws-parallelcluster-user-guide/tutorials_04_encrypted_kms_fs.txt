Disk encryption with a custom KMS Key
AWS ParallelCluster supports the configuration options ebs_kms_key_id and fsx_kms_key_id. These options allow you to provide a custom AWS KMS key for Amazon EBS Disk encryption or Amazon FSx for Lustre. To use them, you specify an ec2_iam_role.
In order for the cluster to create, the AWS KMS key must know the name of the cluster's role. This prevents you from using the role created on cluster create, requiring a custom ec2_iam_role.
Creating the role
First you create a policy:


Go to the IAM Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home.


Under Policies, Create policy, click the JSON tab.


As the policy's body, paste in the Instance Policy. Make sure to replace all occurrences of <AWS ACCOUNT ID> and <REGION>.


Name the policy ParallelClusterInstancePolicy, and then click Create Policy.


Next create a role:


Under Roles, create a role.


Click EC2 as the trusted entity.


Under Permissions, search for the ParallelClusterInstancePolicy role that you just created, and attach it.


Name the role ParallelClusterInstanceRole, and then click Create Role.


Give your key permissions
In the AWS KMS Console > Customer managed keys > click your key's Alias or Key ID.
Click the Add button in the Key users box, underneath the Key policy tab, and search for the ParallelClusterInstanceRole you just created. Attach it.
Creating the cluster
Now create a cluster. The following is an example of a cluster with encrypted Raid 0 drives:
```
[cluster default]
...
raid_settings = rs
ec2_iam_role = ParallelClusterInstanceRole
[raid rs]
shared_dir = raid
raid_type = 0
num_of_raid_volumes = 2
volume_size = 100
encrypted = true
ebs_kms_key_id = xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```
The following is an example with the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system:
```
[cluster default]
...
fsx_settings = fs
ec2_iam_role = ParallelClusterInstanceRole
[fsx fs]
shared_dir = /fsx
storage_capacity = 3600
imported_file_chunk_size = 1024
export_path = s3://bucket/folder
import_path = s3://bucket
weekly_maintenance_start_time = 1:00:00
fsx_kms_key_id = xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```
Similar configurations apply to Amazon EBS and Amazon FSx based file systems.
