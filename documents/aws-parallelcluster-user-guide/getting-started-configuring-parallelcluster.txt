Configuring AWS ParallelCluster
After you install AWS ParallelCluster, complete the following configuration steps.
First, set up your AWS credentials. For more information, see Configuring the AWS CLI in the AWS CLI user guide. 
$ aws configure
  AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [us-east-1]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]:
The Region where the cluster will be launched must have at least one Amazon EC2 key pair. For more information, see Amazon EC2 key pairs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
$ pcluster configure
The configure wizard prompts you for all of the information that's needed to create your cluster. The details of the sequence differ when using AWS Batch as the scheduler compared to using SGE, Slurm, or Torque.
Warning
Starting on December 31, 2021, AWS will no longer include SGE and Torque support for all released versions of AWS ParallelCluster. Previous versions of AWS ParallelCluster that support SGE and Torque will still be available for download and use. However, these versions will not be eligible for future updates or troubleshooting support from AWS service and customer support teams. Moreover, future releases of AWS ParallelCluster made before and after December 31, 2021 will not include support for either SGE or Torque.

[ SGE, Slurm, or Torque ]

After the previous steps are completed, decide whether to use an existing VPC or let AWS ParallelCluster create a VPC for you. If you don't have a properly configured VPC, AWS ParallelCluster can create a new one. It either uses both the head and compute nodes in the same public subnet, or only the head node in a public subnet with all nodes in a private subnet. It is possible to reach your limit on number of VPCs in a Region. The default limit is five VPCs per Region. For more information about this limit and how to request an increase, see VPC and subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
If you let AWS ParallelCluster create a VPC, you must decide whether all nodes should be in a public subnet.

Creating CloudFormation stack...
Do not leave the terminal until the process has finished

When you have completed the preceding steps, a simple cluster launches into a VPC, using an existing subnet that supports public IP's (the route table for the subnet is 0.0.0.0/0 => igw-xxxxxx). Note the following:
 The VPC must have DNS Resolution = yes and DNS Hostnames = yes.
 The VPC should also have DHCP options with the correct domain-name for the Region. The default DHCP Option Set already specifies the required AmazonProvidedDNS. If specifying more than one domain name server, see DHCP options sets in the Amazon VPC User Guide. When using private subnets, use a NAT gateway or an internal proxy to enable web access for compute nodes. For more information, see Network configurations.
When all settings contain valid values, you can launch the cluster by running the create command.
$ pcluster create mycluster
After the cluster reaches the "CREATE_COMPLETE" status, you can connect to it by using your normal SSH client settings. For more details on connecting to Amazon EC2 instances, see the EC2 User Guide in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
If pcluster configure created a new VPC, you can delete that VPC by deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack it created. The name will start with "parallelclusternetworking-" and contain the creation time in a "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" format. You can list the stacks using the list-stacks command.
$ aws --region us-east-2 cloudformation list-stacks \
   --stack-status-filter "CREATE_COMPLETE" \
   --query "StackSummaries[].StackName" | \
   grep -e "parallelclusternetworking-"
    "parallelclusternetworking-pubpriv-20191029205804"
The stack can be deleted using the delete-stack command.
$ aws --region us-west-2 cloudformation delete-stack \
   --stack-name parallelclusternetworking-pubpriv-20191029205804
