Installing Python on Linux
If your distribution didn't come with Python, or came with an earlier version, install Python before installing pip and AWS ParallelCluster.
To install Python 3 on Linux

Check to see if Python is already installed.

$ python3 --version
or
$ python --version
Note
If your Linux distribution came with Python, you might need to install the Python developer package. The developer package includes the headers and libraries that are required to compile extensions and to install AWS ParallelCluster. Use your package manager to install the developer package. It is typically named python-dev or python-devel.


If Python 2.7 or later is not installed, install Python with your distribution's package manager. The command and package name varies:
    On Debian derivatives such as Ubuntu, use apt.
$ sudo apt-get install python3
    On Red Hat and derivatives, use yum.
$ sudo yum install python3
    On SUSE and derivatives, use zypper.
$ sudo zypper install python3


To verify that Python installed correctly, open a command prompt or shell and run the following command.


$ python3 --version
   Python 3.8.5
