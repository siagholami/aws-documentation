Filtering Matching Documents in Amazon CloudSearch
You use the fq parameter to filter the documents that match the search criteria specified with the q parameter without affecting the relevance scores of the documents included in the search results. Specifying a filter just controls which matching documents are included in the results, it has no effect on how they are scored and sorted. 
The fq parameter supports the structured query syntax described in Search API Reference.
For example, you could add an available field to your documents to indicate whether or not an item is in stock, and filter on that field to limit the results to in-stock items: 
search?q=starwars&fq=available:'true'&return=title
