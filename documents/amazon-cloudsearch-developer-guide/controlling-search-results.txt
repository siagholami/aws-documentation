Controlling How Search Results are Returned in Amazon CloudSearch
You can specify parameters in your search request to control how the search results are sorted, return results in XML rather than JSON, and paginate through the result set. You can define expressions that calculate a custom value that can be used to specify search constraints or sort results.
