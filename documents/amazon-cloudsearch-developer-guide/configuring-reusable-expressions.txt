Configuring Reusable Expressions for a Search Domain in Amazon CloudSearch

 DefineRankExpression
When you define an expression in a domain's configuration, you can reference the expression in any search request. Adding an expression to the domain configuration reduces the overhead of specifying it in every request, and helps maximize response times and minimize costs. 
When you add an expression to your domain configuration, it takes some time for the change to be processed and the new expression to become active. To quickly test changes to an expression, you can define and use the expression directly in a search request, as described in Defining Expressions in Search Requests. After you have finished testing and tuning an expression, you should add it to your domain configuration. 
Configuring Expressions Using the Amazon CloudSearch Console
To configure an expression


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/home.


In the Navigation pane, click the name of the domain, and then click the domain's Expressions link.


In the Expressions pane, click the Add a New Expression button. The button is below the list of expressions configured for the domain.


Enter a name for the new expression in the Name field. 


Enter the numerical expression you want to evaluate at search time in the Expression field. You can use the insert... menu to insert special values and mathematical and trigonometric functions.


Click Add a New Expression to configure additional expressions. 


Click Submit to save your changes.


Configuring Amazon CloudSearch Expressions Using the AWS CLI
You use the aws cloudsearch define-expression command to define computed expressions for a domain.
To configure an expression
 Run the aws cloudsearch define-expression command to define a new expression. You specify a name for the expression with the --name option, and the numeric expression that you want to evaluate with the --expression option. For example, the following request creates an expression called popularhits that takes into account a document's popularity and relevance _score.
```
  aws cloudsearch define-expression --domain-name movies --name popularhits --expression '((0.3popularity)/10.0)(0.7 _score)'
{
      "Expression": {
          "Status": {
              "PendingDeletion": false, 
              "State": "Processing", 
              "CreationDate": "2014-05-01T01:15:18Z", 
              "UpdateVersion": 52, 
              "UpdateDate": "2014-05-01T01:15:18Z"
          }, 
          "Options": {
              "ExpressionName": "popularhits", 
              "ExpressionValue": "((0.3popularity)/10.0)(0.7 _score)"
          }
      }
  }
  ```
Configuring Expressions Using the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API
The AWS SDKs (except the Android and iOS SDKs) support all of the Amazon CloudSearch actions defined in the Amazon CloudSearch Configuration API, including [DefineExpression](API_DefineExpression.md). For more information about installing and using the AWS SDKs, see AWS Software Development Kits.
