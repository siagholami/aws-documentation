A fixed (static) IP address that you have allocated in Amazon EC2 or Amazon VPC and then attached to an instance. Elastic IP addresses are associated with your account, not a specific instance. They are elastic because you can easily allocate, attach, detach, and free them as your needs change. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or Availability Zone failures by rapidly remapping your public IP addresses to another instance.
Elastic Load Balancing
A web service that improves an application's availability by distributing incoming traffic between two or more EC2 instances. 
See also https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing.
elastic network interface
An additional network interface that can be attached to an instance. Elastic network interfaces include a primary private IP address, one or more secondary private IP addresses, an Elastic IP Address (optional), a MAC address, membership in specified security groups, a description, and a source/destination check flag. You can create an elastic network interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance, and attach it to another instance.

pagination
The process of responding to an API request by returning a large list of records in small separate parts. Pagination can occur in the following situations:
 The client sets the maximum number of returned records to a value below the total number of records.
 The service has a default maximum number of returned records that is lower than the total number of records.
When an API response is paginated, the service sends a subset of the large list of records and a pagination token that indicates that more records are available. The client includes this pagination token in a subsequent API request, and the service responds with the next subset of records. This continues until the service responds with a subset of records and no pagination token, indicating that all records have been sent. 
pagination token
A marker that indicates that an API response contains a subset of a larger list of records. The client can return this marker in a subsequent API request to retrieve the next subset of records until the service responds with a subset of records and no pagination token, indicating that all records have been sent.

throttling
The automatic restricting or slowing down of a process based on one or more limits. Examples: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams throttles operations if an application (or group of applications operating on the same stream) attempts to get data from a shard at a rate faster than the shard limit. Amazon API Gateway uses throttling to limit the steady-state request rates for a single account. Amazon SES uses throttling to reject attempts to send email that exceeds the sending limits.
time series data
Data provided as part of a metric. The time value is assumed to be when the value occurred. A metric is the fundamental concept for Amazon CloudWatch and represents a time-ordered set of data points. You publish metric data points into CloudWatch and later retrieve statistics about those data points as a time-series ordered dataset.
timestamp
A date/time string in ISO 8601 format.
TLS 
See Transport Layer Security.
tokenization
The process of splitting a stream of text into separate tokens on detectable boundaries such as white space and hyphens.
topic

tuning
Selecting the number and type of AMIs to run a Hadoop job flow most efficiently.
tunnel
A route for transmission of private network traffic that uses the internet to connect nodes in the private network. The tunnel uses encryption and secure protocols such as PPTP to prevent the traffic from being intercepted as it passes through public routing nodes. 
U

usage report
An AWS record that details your usage of a particular AWS service. You can generate and download usage reports from https://aws.amazon.com/usage-reports/.
user
A person or application under an account that needs to make API calls to AWS products. Each user has a unique name within the AWS account, and a set of security credentials not shared with other users. These credentials are separate from the AWS account's security credentials. Each user is associated with one and only one AWS account.

validation 
See template validation.
value
Instances of attributes for an item, such as cells in a spreadsheet. An attribute might have multiple values.
Tagging resources: A specific tag label that acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key). For example, you might have EC2 instance with the tag key of Owner and the tag value of Jan. You can tag an AWS resource with up to 10 key–value pairs. Not all AWS resources can be tagged.
Variable Envelope Return Path 
See VERP.
verification
The process of confirming that you own an email address or a domain so that you can send email from or to it.
VERP
Variable Envelope Return Path. A way in which email sending applications can match bounced email with the undeliverable address that caused the bounce by using a different return path for each recipient. VERP is typically used for mailing lists. With VERP, the recipient's email address is embedded in the address of the return path, which is where bounced email is returned. This makes it possible to automate the processing of bounced email without having to open the bounce messages, which may vary in content.
versioning
Every object in Amazon S3 has a key and a version ID. Objects with the same key, but different version IDs can be stored in the same bucket. Versioning is enabled at the bucket layer using PUT Bucket versioning. 
VGW 
See virtual private gateway.
virtualization
Allows multiple guest virtual machines (VM) to run on a host operating system. Guest VMs can run on one or more levels above the host hardware, depending on the type of virtualization.

virtual private cloud 
See VPC.
virtual private gateway
(VGW) The Amazon side of a VPN connection that maintains connectivity. The internal interfaces of the virtual private gateway connect to your VPC via the VPN attachment and the external interfaces connect to the VPN connection, which leads to the customer gateway.
visibility timeout
The period of time that a message is invisible to the rest of your application after an application component gets it from the queue. During the visibility timeout, the component that received the message usually processes it, and then deletes it from the queue. This prevents multiple components from processing the same message.
volume
A fixed amount of storage on an instance. You can share volume data between containers and persist the data on the container instance when the containers are no longer running. 
VPC
Virtual private cloud. An elastic network populated by infrastructure, platform, and application services that share common security and interconnection.
VPC endpoint
A feature that enables you to create a private connection between your VPC and another AWS service without requiring access over the internet, through a NAT instance, a VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect. 
VPG
