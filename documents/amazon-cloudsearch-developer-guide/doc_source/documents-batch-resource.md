# documents/batch<a name="documents-batch-resource"></a>

This section describes the HTTP request and response messages for the `documents/batch` resource\. 

You create document batches to describe the data that you want to upload to an Amazon CloudSearch domain\. A document batch is a collection of add and delete operations that represent the documents you want to add, update, or delete from your domain\. Batches can be described in either JSON or XML\. A batch provides all of the information Amazon CloudSearch needs for indexing\. Each item that you want to be able to return as a search result \(such as a product\) is represented as a documentâ€”a batch is simply a collection of add and delete requests for individual documents\. Every document has a unique ID and one or more fields that contain the data that you want to search and return in results\. 

To update a document, you specify an add request with the document ID of the document you want to update\. For more information, see [Adding and Updating Documents in Amazon CloudSearch](preparing-data.md#adding-documents)\. Similarly, to delete a document, you submit a delete request with the document ID of the document you want to delete\. For information about deleting documents, see [Deleting Documents in Amazon CloudSearch](preparing-data.md#deleting-documents)\.

For more information about submitting data for indexing, see [Uploading Data to an Amazon CloudSearch Domain](uploading-data.md)\.

## documents/batch JSON API<a name="documents-batch-json"></a>

### JSON documents/batch Requests<a name="documents-batch-json-request"></a>

The body of a `documents/batch` request uses JSON or XML to specify the document operations you want to perform\. A JSON representation of a batch is a collection of objects that define individual add and delete operations\. The `type` property identifies whether an object represents an add or delete operation\. For example, the following JSON batch adds one document and deletes one document:

```
[
{ "type": "add",
  "id":   "tt0484562",
  "fields": {
    "title": "The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising",
    "directors": ["Cunningham, David L."],
    "genres": ["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Thriller"],
    "actors": ["McShane, Ian","Eccleston, Christopher","Conroy, Frances",
              "Crewson, Wendy","Ludwig, Alexander","Cosmo, James",
              "Warner, Amelia","Hickey, John Benjamin","Piddock, Jim",
              "Lockhart, Emma"]
  }
},
{ "type": "delete",
  "id":   "tt0484575"
}]
```

**Note**  
When specifying document batches in JSON, the value for a field cannot be `null`\.

The [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) representation of a batch is shown below:

```
{
    "type": "array",
    "minItems": 1,
    "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "type": {
                "type": "string",
                "enum": ["add", "delete"],
                "required": true
            },
            "id": {
                "type": "string",
                "pattern": "[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_]{0,127}",
                "minLength": 1,
                "maxLength": 128,
                "required": true
            },
            "fields": {
                "type": "object",
                "patternProperties": {
                    "[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_]{0,63}": {
                        "type": "string",
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## documents/batch Status Codes<a name="documents-batch-status-codes"></a>

A document service request can return three types of status codes:
+ 5xx status codes indicate that there was an internal server error\. We recommend catching and retrying all 5xx error codes as they typically represent transient error conditions\.
+ 4xx status codes indicate that the request was malformed\.
+ 2xx status codes indicate that the request was processed successfully\.
