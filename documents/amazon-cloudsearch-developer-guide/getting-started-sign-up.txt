Before You Begin with Amazon CloudSearch
To use Amazon CloudSearch, you need an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Your AWS account enables you to access Amazon CloudSearch and other AWS services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). As with other AWS services, you pay only for the Amazon CloudSearch resources you use. There are no sign up fees and charges are not incurred until you create a search domain. 
If you already have an AWS account, you are automatically signed up for Amazon CloudSearch. 
For console access, use your IAM user name and password to sign in to the AWS Management Console from the IAM sign-in page. IAM lets you securely control access to AWS services and resources in your AWS account. For details about console and programmatic credentials, see Understanding and Getting Your Security Credentials in the AWS General Reference.
