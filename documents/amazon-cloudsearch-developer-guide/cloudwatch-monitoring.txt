Monitoring an Amazon CloudSearch Domain with Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudSearch automatically sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch so that you can gather and analyze performance statistics. You can monitor these metrics by using the Amazon CloudSearch console, or by using the CloudWatch console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Each of your domain's search instances sends metrics to CloudWatch at one-minute intervals. The metrics are archived for two weeks; after that period, the data is discarded. 
There is no charge for the Amazon CloudSearch metrics that are reported through CloudWatch. If you set alarms on the metrics, you will be billed at standard CloudWatch rates. You can use the metrics in all regions supported by Amazon CloudSearch.

 Viewing CloudWatch Metrics for an Amazon CloudSearch Domain
Not all statistics, such as Average or Sum, are applicable for every metric. However, all of these values are available through the Amazon CloudSearch console, or by using the CloudWatch console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs for all metrics. In the following table, each metric has a list of Valid Statistics that is applicable to that metric.
Amazon CloudSearch Metrics
The AWS/CloudSearch namespace includes the following metrics.



Metric
Description




SuccessfulRequests
The number of search requests successfully processed by a search instance.  Units: Count Valid statistics: Maximum, Sum


SearchableDocuments
The number of searchable documents in the domain's search index.  Units: Count Valid statistics: Maximum


IndexUtilization
The percentage of the search instance's index capacity that has been used. The Maximum value indicates the percentage of the domain's index capacity that has been used. Units: Percent Valid statistics: Average, Maximum


Partitions
The number of partitions the index is distributed across. Units: Count Valid statistics: Minimum, Maximum



Dimensions for Amazon CloudSearch Metrics
Amazon CloudSearch sends the ClientId and DomainName dimensions to CloudWatch.



Dimension
Description




ClientId
The AWS account ID.


DomainName
The name of the search domain.



Generating SDK for Java Metrics for Amazon CloudSearch
The AWS SDK for Java can generate performance metrics for your Amazon CloudSearch client and send them to CloudWatch for visualization. For the Java VM arguments that enable this feature, see Enabling Metrics for the AWS SDK for Java in the AWS SDK for Java Developer Guide.
You can use the following code to test metrics generation. The code creates a new CloudWatch client and performs 2,500 searches. Because the SDK only sends metrics once per minute, long-running clients work best. The code uses the default credential provider chain.
```
import com.amazonaws.client.builder.AwsClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.cloudsearchdomain.AmazonCloudSearchDomain;
import com.amazonaws.services.cloudsearchdomain.AmazonCloudSearchDomainClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.cloudsearchdomain.model.SearchRequest;
public class Metrics {
public static void main(String[] args) {
String search_endpoint = "https://search-domain-id.us-west-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com";
String region = "us-west-1";

AwsClientBuilder.EndpointConfiguration endpointConfig = new AwsClientBuilder
    .EndpointConfiguration(search_endpoint, region);

AmazonCloudSearchDomainClientBuilder builder = AmazonCloudSearchDomainClientBuilder
    .standard()
    .withEndpointConfiguration(endpointConfig);

AmazonCloudSearchDomain client = builder.build();

String query;
SearchRequest request = new SearchRequest();
com.amazonaws.services.cloudsearchdomain.model.SearchResult test = client.search(request);

for (int i = 0; i < 2500; i) {
  query = "test";
  request.setQuery(query);
  test = client.search(request);
  System.out.println(test.toString());
}

}
}
```
To verify that the SDK is sending metrics to CloudWatch, check the Metrics page of the CloudWatch console and look for AWSSDK/Java under the Custom Namespaces section. The metrics might take several minutes to display.
Viewing CloudWatch Metrics for an Amazon CloudSearch Domain
The Amazon CloudSearch console graphs the metrics reported to CloudWatch. You can also access the metrics through the CloudWatch console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs. For more information, see Viewing, Graphing, and Publishing Metrics in the * Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide*.
To view metrics for a search domain using the Amazon CloudSearch console


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon CloudSearch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch.


In the navigation pane, click the name of the domain, and then click the domain's Monitoring link.
