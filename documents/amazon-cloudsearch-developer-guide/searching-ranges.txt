Searching for a Range of Values in Amazon CloudSearch
You can use structured queries to search a field for a range of values. To specify a range of values, use a comma (,) to separate the upper and lower bounds and enclose the range using brackets or braces. A square brace, [ or ], indicates that the bound is included in the range, a curly brace, { or }, excludes the bound. 
For example, to search the sample data set for movies released from 2008 to 2010 (inclusive), specify the range as [2008,2010].
To specify an open-ended range, omit the bound. For example, year:[2002,} matches all movies released from 2002 onward, and year:{,1970] matches all movies released through 1970. When you omit a bound, you must use a curly brace.
In a compound query, you use the range operator syntax to search for a range of values; for example: (range field=year [1967,}).
Searching for a Date Range
To search for a range of dates (or times) in a date field, you use the same bracketed range syntax that you use for numeric values, but you must enclose the date string in single quotes. For example, the following request searches the movie data for all movies with a release date of January 1, 2013 or later:
q.parser=structured&q=release_date:['2013-01-01T00:00:00Z',}
Use the following syntax to search for a fixed range:
q.parser=structured&q=release_date:['2013-01-01T00:00:00Z','2013-01-02T23:59:59Z']
Searching for a Location Range
You can perform a bounding box search by searching for a range of locations. To search for a range of locations in a latlon field, you use the same bracketed range syntax that you use for numeric values, but you must enclose the latitude/longitude pair in single quotes. 
For example, if you include a location field in each document, you could specify your bounding box filter as location:['nn.n,nn.n','nn.n,nn.n']. In the following example, the matches for restaurant are filtered so that only matches within the downtown area of Paso Robles, CA are included in the results. 
q='restaurant'&fq=location:['35.628611,-120.694152','35.621966,-120.686706']&q.parser=structured

Searching for a Text Range
You can also search a text or literal field for a range of values using the bracketed range syntax. Like dates, the text strings must be enclosed in single quotes. For example, the following request searches the movie data for a range of document IDs. To reference a document's ID, you use the special field name _id.
_id:['tt1000000','tt1005000']
