Your account is charged a monthly price for each private CA starting from the time that you create it\. You are also charged for each certificate that you issue\. This charge includes certificates that you export from ACM and certificates that you create from the ACM Private CA API or ACM Private CA CLI\. You are not charged for a private CA after it has been deleted\. However, if you restore a private CA, you are charged for the time between deletion and restoration\. Private certificates whose private key you cannot access are free\. These include certificates that are used with [Integrated Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html) such as Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, and API Gateway\. For the latest ACM Private CA pricing information, see the [ACM Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/pricing/) page on the AWS website\.
