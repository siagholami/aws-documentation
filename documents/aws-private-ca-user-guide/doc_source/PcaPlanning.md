# Planning Your ACM Private CA Deployment<a name="PcaPlanning"></a>

ACM Private CA gives you complete, cloud\-based control over your organization's private PKI \(public key infrastructure\), extending from a root certificate authority \(CA\), through subordinate CAs, to end\-entity certificates\. Thorough planning is essential for a PKI that is secure, maintainable, extensible, and suited to your organization's needs\. This section provides guidance on designing a CA hierarchy, managing your private CA and private end\-entity certificate lifecycles, and applying best practices for security\.
