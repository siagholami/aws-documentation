# Services Integrated with AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority<a name="PcaIntegratedServices"></a>

If you use AWS Certificate Manager to request a private certificate, you can associate that certificate with any service that is integrated with ACM\. This applies both to certificates chained to a ACM Private CA root and to certificates chained to an external root\. For more information, see [Integrated Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html) in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide\. 

If you use the ACM Private CA API or AWS CLI to issue a certificate or to export a private certificate from ACM, you can install the certificate anywhere you want\.
