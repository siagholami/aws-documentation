Services Integrated with AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority
If you use AWS Certificate Manager to request a private certificate, you can associate that certificate with any service that is integrated with ACM. This applies both to certificates chained to a ACM Private CA root and to certificates chained to an external root. For more information, see Integrated Services in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide. 
If you use the ACM Private CA API or AWS CLI to issue a certificate or to export a private certificate from ACM, you can install the certificate anywhere you want.
