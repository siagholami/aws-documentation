Step 1: Create two S3 buckets
(Part of: Getting started with AWS CodeBuild using the console)
Although you can use a single bucket for this tutorial, two buckets makes it easier to see where the build input is coming from and where the build output is going.
 One of these buckets (the input bucket) stores the build input. In this tutorial, the name of this input bucket is codebuild-region-ID-account-ID-input-bucket, where region-ID is the AWS Region of the bucket and account-ID is your AWS account ID.
 The other bucket (the output bucket) stores the build output. In this tutorial, the name of this output bucket is codebuild-region-ID-account-ID-output-bucket.
If you chose different names for these buckets, be sure to use them throughout this tutorial.
These two buckets must be in the same AWS Region as your builds. For example, if you instruct CodeBuild to run a build in the US East (Ohio) Region, these buckets must also be in the US East (Ohio) Region.
For more information, see Creating a Bucket in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide. 
Note
Although CodeBuild also supports build input stored in CodeCommit, GitHub, and Bitbucket repositories, this tutorial does not show you how to use them. For more information, see Plan a build.
