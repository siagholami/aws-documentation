Update a report group (console)
To update a report group


Open the AWS CodeBuild console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Report groups. 


Choose the report group you want to update. 


Choose Edit.


Select or clear Backup to Amazon S3. If you selected this option, specify your export settings:


For S3 bucket name, enter the name of the S3 bucket. 


For Path prefix, enter the path in your S3 bucket where you want to upload your test results. 


Select Compress test result data in a zip file to compress your raw test result data files. 


Expand Additional configuration to display encryption options. Choose one of the following: 

Default AWS managed key to use a customer master key (CMK) for Amazon S3 that is managed by the AWS Key Management Service. In CodeBuild, the default CMK is for Amazon S3 and uses the format aws/S3. For more information, see Customer managed CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service User Guide. This is the default encryption option.
Choose a custom key to use a CMK that you create and configure. For AWS KMS encryption key, enter the ARN of your encryption key. Its format is arn:aws:kms:region-id:aws-account-id:key/key-id. For more information, see Creating KMS keys in the AWS Key Management Service User Guide. 
Disable artifact encryption to disable encryption. You might choose this option if you want to share your test results or publish them to a static website. (A dynamic website can run code to decrypt test results.)
