Start running builds automatically (AWS CLI)
If your source code is stored in a GitHub or a GitHub Enterprise Server repository, you can use GitHub webhooks to have AWS CodeBuild rebuild your source code whenever a code change is pushed to the repository.
Run the create-webhookcommand as follows:
aws codebuild create-webhook --project-name <project-name>
 is the name of the build project that contains the source code to be rebuilt.
For GitHub, information similar to the following appears in the output:
{
  "webhook": {
    "url": "<url>"
  }
}
 is the URL to the GitHub webhook.
For GitHub Enterprise Server, information similar to the following appears in the output:



Copy the secret key and payload URL from the output. You need them to add a webhook in GitHub Enterprise Server. 


In GitHub Enterprise Server, choose the repository where your CodeBuild project is stored. Choose Settings, choose Hooks & services, and then choose Add webhook. 


Enter the payload URL and secret key, accept the defaults for the other fields, and then choose Add webhook.
