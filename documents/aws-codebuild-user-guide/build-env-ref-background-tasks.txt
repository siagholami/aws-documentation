Background tasks in build environments
You can run background tasks in build environments. To do this, in your buildspec, use the nohup command to run a command as a task in the background, even if the build process exits the shell. Use the disown command to forcibly stop a running background task.
Examples:
 Start a background process and wait for it to complete later:
nohup sleep 30 & echo $! > pidfile
  …
  wait $(cat pidfile)
  Start a background process and do not wait for it to ever complete:
nohup sleep 30 & disown $!
  Start a background process and kill it later:
nohup sleep 30 & echo $! > pidfile
  …
  kill $(cat pidfile)
