Open the AWS CodeBuild console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Build projects.
Note
By default, only the 10 most recent build projects are displayed. To view more build projects, choose the gear icon, and then choose a different value for Projects per page or use the back and forward arrows.


In the list of build projects, in the Name column, choose the link for the build project.


On the Build project: project-name page, choose Build details.


View a build project's details (AWS CLI)
Run the batch-get-projects command:
aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names names
In the preceding command, replace the following placeholder:
 names: Required string used to indicate one or more build project names to view details about. To specify more than one build project, separate each build project's name with a space. You can specify up to 100 build project names. To get a list of build projects, see View a list of build project names (AWS CLI).
For example, if you run this command:
aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names codebuild-demo-project codebuild-demo-project2 my-other-demo-project
A result similar to the following might appear in the output. Ellipses (...) are used to represent data omitted for brevity.
{
  "projectsNotFound": [
    "my-other-demo-project"
  ],
  "projects": [
    {
      ...
      "name": codebuild-demo-project,
      ...
    },
    {
      ...
      "name": codebuild-demo-project2",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
In the preceding output, the projectsNotFound array lists any build project names that were specified, but not found. The projects array lists details for each build project where information was found. Build project details have been omitted from the preceding output for brevity. For more information, see the output of Create a build project (AWS CLI).
