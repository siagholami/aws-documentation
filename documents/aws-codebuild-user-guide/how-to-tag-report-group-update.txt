Edit tags for a report group
You can change the value for a tag associated with a report group. You can also change the name of the key, which is equivalent to removing the current tag and adding a different one with the new name and the same value as the other key. Keep in mind that there are restrictions on the characters you can use in the key and value fields. For more information, see Tags.
Important
Editing tags for a report group can impact access to that report group. Before you edit the name (key) or value of a tag for a report group, make sure to review any IAM policies that might use the key or value for a tag to control access to resources such as report groups. For examples of tag-based access policies, see Deny or allow actions on report groups based on resource tags.
