# Monitoring CodeBuild resource utilization metrics<a name="monitoring-utilization-metrics"></a>

AWS CodeBuild monitors build resource utilization on your behalf and reports metrics through Amazon CloudWatch\. These include metrics such as CPU, memory, and storage utilization\.

You can use the CodeBuild console or the CloudWatch console to monitor resource utilization metrics for CodeBuild\. The following procedures show you how to access your resource utilization metrics\.

**Note**  
CodeBuild resource utilization metrics are only available in the following regions:  
Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\) Region
Asia Pacific \(Seoul\) Region
Asia Pacific \(Mumbai\) Region
Asia Pacific \(Singapore\) Region
Asia Pacific \(Sydney\) Region
Canada \(Central\) Region
Europe \(Frankfurt\) Region
