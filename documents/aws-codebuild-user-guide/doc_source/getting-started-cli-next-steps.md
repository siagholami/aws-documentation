In this tutorial, you used AWS CodeBuild to build a set of Java class files into a JAR file\. You then viewed the build's results\.

You can now try using CodeBuild in your own scenarios\. Follow the instructions in [Plan a build](planning.md)\. If you don't feel ready yet, you might want to try building some of the samples\. For more information, see [Samples](samples.md)\.
