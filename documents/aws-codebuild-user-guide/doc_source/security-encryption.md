# Data encryption<a name="security-encryption"></a>

 Encryption is an important part of CodeBuild security\. Some encryption, such as for data in\-transit, is provided by default and does not require you to do anything\. Other encryption, such as for data at\-rest, you can configure when you create your project or build\. 
+  **Encryption of data at\-rest** \- Build artifacts, such as a cache, logs, exported raw test report data files, and build results, are encrypted by default using *customer master keys* \(CMKs\) for Amazon S3 that are managed by the AWS Key Management Service\. If you do not want to use these CMKs, you must create and configure a customer\-managed CMK\. For more information [Creating KMS Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) and [AWS Key Management Service concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service User Guide*\. 
  + You can store the identifier of the AWS KMS key that CodeBuild uses to encrypt the build output artifact in the `CODEBUILD_KMS_KEY_ID` environment variable\. For more information, see [Environment variables in build environments](build-env-ref-env-vars.md) 
  + You can specify a customer\-managed CMK when you create a build project\. For more information, see [Set the Encryption Key Using the Console](create-project-console.md#encryptionkey-console) and [Set the encryption key using the CLI](create-project-cli.md#cli.encryptionkey)\. 

   The Amazon Elastic Block Store volumes of your build fleet are encrypted by default using CMKs managed by AWS\. 
+  **Encryption of data in\-transit** \- All communication between customers and CodeBuild and between CodeBuild and its downstream dependencies is protected using TLS connections that are signed using the Signature Version 4 signing process\. All CodeBuild endpoints use SHA\-256 certificates that are managed by AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority\. For more information, see [Signature Version 4 signing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) and [What is ACM PCA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/)\. 
+  **Build artifact encryption** \- CodeBuild requires access to an AWS KMS CMK in order to encrypt its build output artifacts\. By default, CodeBuild uses an AWS Key Management Service CMK for Amazon S3 in your AWS account\. If you do not want to use this CMK, you must create and configure a customer\-managed CMK\.
