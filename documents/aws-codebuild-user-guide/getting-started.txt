Getting started with AWS CodeBuild using the console
In this tutorial, you use AWS CodeBuild to build a collection of sample source code input files (build input artifacts or build input) into a deployable version of the source code (build output artifact or build output). Specifically, you instruct CodeBuild to use Apache Maven, a common build tool, to build a set of Java class files into a Java Archive (JAR) file. You do not need to be familiar with Apache Maven or Java to complete this tutorial.
You can work with CodeBuild through the CodeBuild console, AWS CodePipeline, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs. This tutorial demonstrates how to use the CodeBuild console. For information about using CodePipeline, see Use CodePipeline with CodeBuild. For information about using the AWS SDKs, see Run CodeBuild directly. 
Important
The steps in this tutorial require you to create resources (for example, an S3 bucket) that might result in charges to your AWS account. These include possible charges for CodeBuild and for AWS resources and actions related to Amazon S3, AWS KMS, and CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see AWS CodeBuild pricing, Amazon S3 pricing, AWS Key Management Service pricing, and Amazon CloudWatch pricing.
Steps

Step 1: Create two S3 buckets
Step 2: Create the source code
Step 3: Create the buildspec file
Step 4: Upload the source code and the buildspec file
Step 5: Create the build project
Step 6: Run the build
Step 7: View summarized build information
Step 8: View detailed build information
Step 9: Get the build output artifact
Step 10: Delete the S3 input bucket
