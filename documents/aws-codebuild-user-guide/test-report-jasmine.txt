Set up test reporting with Jasmine
The following procedure demonstrates how to set up test reporting in AWS CodeBuild with the JasmineBDD testing framework. 
The procedure requires the following prerequisites:
 You have an existing AWS CodeBuild project.
 Your project is a Node.js project that is set up to use the Jasmine testing framework.
Add the https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-reporters package to the devDependencies section of your project's package.json file. This package has a collection of JavaScript reporter classes that can be used with Jasmine. 
npm install --save-dev jasmine-reporters
If it's not already present, add the test script to your project's package.json file. The test script ensures that Jasmine is called when npm test is executed.
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npx jasmine"
  }
}
AWS CodeBuild supports the following Jasmine test reporters:
JUnitXmlReporter
Used to generate reports in the JunitXml format.
NUnitXmlReporter
Used to generate reports in the NunitXml format.
A Node.js project with Jasmine will, by default, have a spec sub-directory, which contains the Jasmine configuration and test scripts. 
To configure Jasmine to generate reports in the JunitXML format, instantiate the JUnitXmlReporter reporter by adding the following code to your tests. 
```
var reporters = require('jasmine-reporters');
var junitReporter = new reporters.JUnitXmlReporter({
  savePath: ,
  filePrefix: ,
  consolidateAll: true
});
jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(junitReporter);
```
To configure Jasmine to generate reports in the NunitXML format, instantiate the NUnitXmlReporter reporter by adding the following code to your tests. 
```
var reporters = require('jasmine-reporters');
var nunitReporter = new reporters.NUnitXmlReporter({
  savePath: ,
  filePrefix: ,
  consolidateAll: true
});
jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(nunitReporter)
```
The test reports are exported to the file specified by /.
In your buildspec.yml file, add/update the following sections.
```
version: 0.2
phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - npm install
  build:
    commands:
      - npm build
      - npm test
reports:
  jasmine_reports:
    files:
      - 
    file-format: JUNITXML
    base-directory: 
```
If you are using the the NunitXml report format, change the file-format value to the following.
file-format: NUNITXML
