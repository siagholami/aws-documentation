Batch builds in AWS CodeBuild
AWS CodeBuild supports the execution of concurrent and coordinated builds of a project with batch builds. For more information, see the following topics:

Batch builds introduce a new security role in the batch configuration. This new role is required as CodeBuild must be able to call the StartBuild, StopBuild, and RetryBuild actions on your behalf to run builds as part of a batch. Customers should use a new role, and not the same role they use in their build, for two reasons:
 Giving the build role StartBuild, StopBuild, and RetryBuild permissions would allow a single build to start more builds via the buildspec.
 CodeBuild batch builds provide restrictions that restrict the number of builds and compute types that can be used for the builds in the batch. If the build role has these permissions, it is possible the builds themselves could bypass these restrictions.
