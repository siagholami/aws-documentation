Edit AWS CodeBuild triggers
You can edit a trigger on a project to schedule a build once every hour, day, or week. You can also edit a trigger to use a custom rule with an Amazon CloudWatch cron expression. For example, using a cron expression, you can schedule a build at a specific time on every weekday. For information about creating a trigger, see Create AWS CodeBuild triggers.
To edit a trigger


Open the AWS CodeBuild console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/home.


In the navigation pane, choose Build projects.


Choose the link for the build project you want to change, and then choose the Build triggers tab.
Note
By default, the 100 most recent build projects are displayed. To view more build projects, choose the gear icon, and then choose a different value for Projects per page or use the back and forward arrows.


Choose the radio button next to the trigger you want to change, and then choose Edit.


From the Frequency drop-down list, choose the frequency for your trigger. If you want to create a frequency using a cron expression, choose Custom.


Specify the parameters for the frequency of your trigger. You can enter the first few characters of your selections in the text box to filter drop-down menu items.
Note
 Start hours and minutes are zero-based. The start minute is a number between zero and 59. The start hour is a number between zero and 23. For example, a daily trigger that starts every day at 12:15 P.M. has a start hour of 12 and a start minute of 15. A daily trigger that starts every day at midnight has a start hour of zero and a start minute of zero. A daily trigger that starts every day at 11:59 P.M. has a start hour of 23 and a start minute of 59.
