Create a test report
To create a test report, you run a build project that is configured with one to five report groups in its buildspec file. A test report is created during the run. It contains the results of the test cases that are specified for the report groups. A new test report is generated for each subsequent build that uses the same buildspec file. 
To create a test report


Create a build project. For information, see Create a build project in AWS CodeBuild. 


Configure the buildspec file of your project with test report informaton: 


Add a reports: section and specify the name for your report group. CodeBuild creates a report group for you using your project name and the name you specified in the format project-name-report-group-name-in-buildspec. If you already have a report group you want to use, specify its ARN. (If you use its name instead of its ARN, CodeBuild creates a new report group.) For more information, see Reports syntax in the buildspec file. 


Under the report group, specify the location of the files that store test results. If you use more than one report group, specify test result file locations for each one. A new test report is created each time your build project runs. For more information, see Specify test files. 


In the commands section of the build or post_build sequence, specify the commands that run the tests cases you specified for your report groups. For more information, see  Specify test commands . 


Run a build of the build project. For more information, see Run a build in AWS CodeBuild. 


When the build is complete, choose the new build run from Build history on your project page. Choose Reports to view the test report. For more information, see View test reports for a build.
