# Buying products<a name="buyer-subscribing-to-products"></a>

Buying a product means that you have accepted the terms of the product as shown on the product’s listing page\. This includes pricing terms and the seller’s end user license agreement \(EULA\), and that you agree to use such product in accordance with the [AWS Customer Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/)\. 

If the product has a monthly fee or is purchased with a subscription contract, you are charged the fee upon subscription, prorated based on the time remaining in the month\. No other charges are assessed until you launch an Amazon EC2 instance with the product AMI, deploy the product using an AWS CloudFormation template, or register the product on the seller's website\. 

If the product has an annual subscription option, you are charged the full annual fee upon subscription\. This charge covers product usage base, with subscription renewal due on the anniversary of the original subscription date\. If you don't renew at the end of the annual subscription period, the subscription converts to an hourly subscription at the current hourly rate\.
