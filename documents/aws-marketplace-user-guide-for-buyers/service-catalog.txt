Adding AWS Marketplace subscriptions to AWS Service Catalog
AWS Service Catalog allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on Amazon Web Services (AWS). These IT services can include everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, and databases to complete multi-tier application architectures. AWS Service Catalog allows you to centrally manage commonly deployed IT services. AWS Service Catalog helps you achieve consistent governance and meet your compliance requirements, while enabling users to quickly deploy only the approved IT services they need.
