Clean Up Resources
To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, delete the resources you created after you're done with the getting started exercise. To delete the resources, use either the Amazon Personalize console or the Delete APIs from the SDKs or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For example, use the DeleteCampaign API to delete a campaign.
You can't delete a resource whose status is CREATE PENDING or IN PROGRESS. The resource status must be ACTIVE or CREATE FAILED. Check the status using the Describe APIs, for example, DescribeCampaign.
Some resources must be deleted before others, as shown in the following table. This process can take some time.
To delete the training data you uploaded, ratings.csv, see How Do I Delete Objects from an S3 Bucket?.
