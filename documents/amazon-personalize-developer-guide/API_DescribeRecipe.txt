DescribeRecipe
Describes a recipe.
A recipe contains three items:
 An algorithm that trains a model.
 Hyperparameters that govern the training.
 Feature transformation information for modifying the input data before training.
Amazon Personalize provides a set of predefined recipes. You specify a recipe when you create a solution with the CreateSolution API. CreateSolution trains a model by using the algorithm in the specified recipe and a training dataset. The solution, when deployed as a campaign, can provide recommendations using the GetRecommendations API.
