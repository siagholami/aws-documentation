CreateDatasetGroup
Creates an empty dataset group. A dataset group contains related datasets that supply data for training a model. A dataset group can contain at most three datasets, one for each type of dataset:
 Interactions
 Items
 Users
To train a model (create a solution), a dataset group that contains an Interactions dataset is required. Call CreateDataset to add a dataset to the group.
A dataset group can be in one of the following states:
 CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
 DELETE PENDING
To get the status of the dataset group, call DescribeDatasetGroup. If the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a failureReason key, which describes why the creation failed.
Note
You must wait until the status of the dataset group is ACTIVE before adding a dataset to the group.
You can specify an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt the datasets in the group. If you specify a KMS key, you must also include an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has permission to access the key.
