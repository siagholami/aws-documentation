Solution
An object that provides information about a solution. A solution is a trained model that can be deployed as a campaign.
Contents
autoMLResult 
When performAutoML is true, specifies the best recipe found.
Type: AutoMLResult object
Required: No
creationDateTime 
The creation date and time (in Unix time) of the solution.
Type: Timestamp
Required: No
datasetGroupArn 
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group that provides the training data.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: arn:([a-z\d-]):personalize:.*:.*:. 
Required: No
eventType 
The event type (for example, 'click' or 'like') that is used for training the model. If no eventType is provided, Amazon Personalize uses all interactions for training with equal weight regardless of type.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Required: No
lastUpdatedDateTime 
The date and time (in Unix time) that the solution was last updated.
Type: Timestamp
Required: No
latestSolutionVersion 
Describes the latest version of the solution, including the status and the ARN.
Type: SolutionVersionSummary object
Required: No
name 
The name of the solution.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 63.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\-_]* 
Required: No
performAutoML 
When true, Amazon Personalize performs a search for the best USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe from the list specified in the solution configuration (recipeArn must not be specified). When false (the default), Amazon Personalize uses recipeArn for training.
Type: Boolean
Required: No
performHPO 
Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO) on the chosen recipe. The default is false.
Type: Boolean
Required: No
recipeArn 
The ARN of the recipe used to create the solution.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: arn:([a-z\d-]):personalize:.*:.*:. 
Required: No
solutionArn 
The ARN of the solution.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: arn:([a-z\d-]):personalize:.*:.*:. 
Required: No
solutionConfig 
Describes the configuration properties for the solution.
Type: SolutionConfig object
Required: No
status 
The status of the solution.
A solution can be in one of the following states:
 CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
 DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS
Type: String
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256.
Required: No
