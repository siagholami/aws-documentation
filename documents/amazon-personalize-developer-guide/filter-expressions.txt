Filter Expressions
Use filter expressions to explicitly define which items are included or excluded from your Amazon Personalize recommendations. To configure filters, you must use a properly formatted filter expression. Filter expressions are composed of dataset and property identifiers in dataset.property format, along with logical operators and keywords.
For a complete list of filter expression elements, see Filter Expression Elements. For examples of filter expressions, see Filter Expression Examples. 
Note
Amazon Personalize ignores case only when matching event types. It recognizes event types and items that were present during solution version training or that are streamed using the PutEvents operation. For more information, see Creating a Solution.
Creating Filter Expressions
You can either manually create filter expressions or get help with expression syntax and structure by using the Expression builder in the console. You can use filter expressions to filter items that are contained in the following datasets:
  Interactions: Use filter expressions to include or exclude items that a user has interacted with (for example, user events such as click or stream). Amazon Personalize filters recommendations based on the most recent 200 historical and 100 new interaction events recorded in a user's Interactions dataset.
  Items: Use filter expressions to include or exclude items based on specific item conditions. 
  Users: Use filter expressions to include or exclude items based on specific user conditions. You can add CurrentUser, which is part of the User dataset, to any expression regardless of the dataset that is being used in the expression.
Note
You can't chain Interaction and Item datasets into one expression. To create a filter that filters by Interaction and then Item datasets (or the opposite), you must chain two or more expressions together. For more information, see Multiple Expressions Example. 
Filter Expression Elements
Use the following elements to create filter expressions:
 INCLUDE: Use INCLUDE to make sure certain items are in recommendations.
 EXCLUDE: Use EXCLUDE to remove certain items from recommendations.
 ItemID: Use ItemID as a placeholder following an INCLUDE or EXCLUDE element.
  WHERE: Use WHERE to check conditions for items. You must use the WHERE element after the ItemID. 
  AND/OR: Use AND or OR to chain multiple conditions together within the same filter expression. 
  IF: Use IF only to check conditions for the CurrentUser and only once at the end of an expression. However, you can extend an IF condition using AND. 
  IN/NOT IN: Use IN or NOT IN as comparison operators to filter based on matching (or not matching) one or more string values. Amazon Personalize filters only on exact strings.
  Use =, <, <=, >, >= operators to test numerical data for equality.
  Use * only only for filters that use the EVENT_TYPE property of the Interaction dataset. 
  Use the pipe separator (|) to chain multiple expressions together. For more information, see Multiple Expressions Example. 
Filter Expression Examples
Use the following examples to learn how to build your own filter expressions. They are organized by dataset type. 
Interactions 
The following expression excludes items that the user clicked or streamed. 
EXCLUDE ItemID WHERE Interactions.EVENT_TYPE IN ("click", "stream")
The following expression includes items that the user has interacted with in any way.
INCLUDE ItemID WHERE Interactions.EVENT_TYPE IN ("*")
Items 
The following expression excludes items in the shoe category that do not have a description of boot. 
EXCLUDE ItemID WHERE Items.CATEGORY IN ("shoe") AND Items.DESCRIPTION NOT IN ("boot")
The following expression includes items with a NUMBER_OF_DOWNLOADS less than 20. 
INCLUDE ItemID WHERE Items.NUMBER_OF_DOWNLOADS < 20
Users 
The following expression excludes items where the NUMBER_OF_DOWNLOADS is less than 20 if the current user's age is over 18, but less than 30. 
EXCLUDE ItemID WHERE Items.NUMBER_OF_DOWNLOADS < 20 IF CurrentUser.AGE > 18 AND CurrentUser.AGE < 30
The following expression includes items in the watch category, with a description of luxury, if the current user's age is over 18. 
INCLUDE ItemID WHERE Items.CATEGORY IN ("watch") AND Items.DESCRIPTION IN ("luxury") IF CurrentUser.AGE > 18
Multiple Expressions Example
You can chain multiple expressions together using a pipe separator. This allows you pass the results of one expression to an additional expression so you can filter by multiple datasets and use more precise filtering.
The following example includes two expressions. The first includes items in the drama genre, and the result of this filter is passed to another expression that excludes items that the user has clicked or streamed.
INCLUDE ItemID WHERE Items.GENRE IN ("drama") | EXCLUDE ItemID WHERE Interactions.EVENT_TYPE IN ("click", "stream")
