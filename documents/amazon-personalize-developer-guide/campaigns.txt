Creating a Campaign
A campaign is used to make recommendations for your users. You create a campaign by deploying a solution version. For an example using the AWS CLI, see Step 3: Create a Campaign (Deploy the Solution).
To create a campaign with the SDK, call the CreateCampaign API and pass the following:
 A name for the campaign.
 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution version to deploy.
 The minimum provisioned transactions per second (minProvisionedTPS) that Amazon Personalize will support. For more information on minProvisionedTPS, see the CreateCampaign API.
Create a campaign using the AWS Python SDK


Create a solution version to deploy. For more information, see Creating a Solution.


Use the following code to create a campaign for a solution version trained using the User-Personalization recipe with the optional default explorationWeight and explorationItemAgeCutOff for itemExplorationConfig. For more information, see User-Personalization


```
   import boto3
personalize = boto3.client('personalize')
create_campaign_response = personalize.create_campaign(
       name = 'campaign name',
       solutionVersionArn = 'solution version arn',
       minProvisionedTPS = 1,
       campaignConfig = {"itemExplorationConfig": {"explorationWeight": "0.3", "explorationItemAgeCutOff": "30"}}
   )
arn = response['campaignArn']
description = personalize.describe_campaign(campaignArn = arn)['campaign']
   print('Name: '  description['name'])
   print('ARN: '  description['campaignArn'])
   print('Status: '  description['status'])
   ```
The campaign isn't ready for use until its status is active. To get the current status, call DescribeCampaign and check that the status field is ACTIVE.
Amazon Personalize provides operations for managing campaigns such as ListCampaigns to list the campaigns you have created. You can delete a campaign by calling DeleteCampaign. If you delete a campaign, the solution versions that are part of the campaign are not deleted.
After you have created your campaign, use it to make recommendations. For more information, see Getting Recommendations.
