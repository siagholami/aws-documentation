Monthly Report
Important
The Monthly Report feature will be unavailable at a later date. We strongly recommend that you use the AWS Cost and Usage Reports instead.
You can download a Monthly Report of your estimated AWS charges from the Bills page of the Billing and Cost Management console.
If you use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations, this report is available only for a master (payer) account, and includes activity for all the member accounts. Member account owners can obtain the monthly report only from the master account. For more information, see Consolidated Billing for Organizations in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
The report contains line items for each unique combination of AWS product, usage type, and operation that the account uses. The estimated report is updated up to several times per day. You can get reports for previous months by selecting the statement period, starting with the report for the month when you signed up for monthly reports. Reports from before you signed up are not available.
