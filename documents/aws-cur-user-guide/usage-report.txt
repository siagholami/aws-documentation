AWS Usage Report
Important
The AWS Usage Report feature will be unavailable at a later date. We strongly recommend that you use the AWS Cost and Usage Reports instead.
You can download dynamically generated AWS usage reports. Each report covers a single service, and you can choose which usage type, operation, and time period to include. You can also choose how the data is aggregated.
