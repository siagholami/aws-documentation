Creating a New Amazon S3 Bucket For Your Reports
This process shows how you create new Amazon S3 buckets for your cost and usage reports.
Note

Choose Next.


Choose Next.


(Optional) If you choose Grant Amazon Simple Storage Service Log Delivery group write access to this bucket, you can enable access logs that track who accesses your Amazon S3 bucket.
