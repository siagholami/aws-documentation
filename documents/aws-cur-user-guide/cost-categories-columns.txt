Cost Categories Details








Cost Category is in preview release for AWS Billing and Cost Management and is subject to change. Your use of Cost Categories is subject to the Beta Service Participation terms of the AWS Service Terms (Section 1.10).



You can use the Cost Category columns to find information about the specific line items categorized by the Cost Categories feature. Cost Category columns are automatically populated when you create a Cost Category and categorization rule. These columns include user-defined Cost Category names as the column headers, and corresponding Cost Category values. Examples include the following:
costCategory/Project

costCategory/Team
Use a Team Cost Category to categorize cost and usage information associated with the team. Team names such as “Marketing” will show as values under costCategory/Team.
costCategory/Environment
Use a Environment Cost Category to categorize cost and usage information associated with the environment. Environment names such as “Development” will show as values under costCategory/Environment.
