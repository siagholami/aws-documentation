Tagging AWS Elemental MediaConnect resources
A tag is a custom attribute label that you assign or that AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag has two parts:
 A tag key (for example, CostCenter, Environment, or Project). Tag keys are case sensitive.
 An optional field known as a tag value (for example, 111122223333 or Production). Omitting the tag value is the same as using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are case sensitive.
Tags help you do the following:
 Identify and organize your AWS resources. Many AWS services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you could assign the same tag to an AWS Elemental MediaConnect flow that you assign to an AWS Elemental MediaLive channel output.
 Track your AWS costs. You activate these tags on the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard. AWS uses the tags to categorize your costs and deliver a monthly cost allocation report to you. For more information, see Use Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
