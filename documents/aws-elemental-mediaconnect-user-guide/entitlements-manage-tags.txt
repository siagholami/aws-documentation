Managing tags on an entitlement
You can use tags to help you track the billing and organization for your AWS Elemental MediaConnect flows, entitlements, and outputs. These are the same tags that AWS Billing and Cost Management provides for organizing your AWS bill. For more information about using tags for cost allocation, see Use Cost Allocation Tags for Custom Billing Reports in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
