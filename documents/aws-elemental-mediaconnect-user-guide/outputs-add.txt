Adding outputs to a flow
You can add up to 50 outputs for each flow. Every output must have a name, a protocol, an IP address, and a port.
Note
If you intend to set up an entitlement for an output, don't create the output. Instead, grant an entitlement. When the subscriber creates a flow using your content as the source, the service creates an output on your flow.
The method you use to add an output to a flow is dependent on the type of output that you want to add:
 Standard output – Sends content to any destination that is not a virtual private cloud (VPC) that you configured using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud.
 VPC output – Sends content to a VPC that you configured using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud.
