Monitoring and tagging in AWS Elemental MediaConnect
Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of AWS Elemental MediaConnect and your other AWS solutions. AWS provides the following monitoring tools to watch MediaConnect, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when appropriate:
 AWS CloudTrail captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred. For more information, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.
 Amazon CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources and the applications that you run on AWS in real time. You can collect and track metrics, create customized dashboards, and set alarms that notify you or take actions when a specified metric reaches a threshold that you specify. For example, you can have CloudWatch track the number of dropped and unrecovered packets on your AWS Elemental MediaConnect flows and automatically notify you when those values exceed a certain number. For more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
