Step 3b: Create a user group
You can create a user group for each policy and assign users to a group rather than attaching individual policies to each user. Using the following procedure, create two user groups: one for the MediaConnectAllAccess policy and one for the MediaConnectReadOnlyAccess policy.
To create user groups


In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Groups.


On the Groups page, create an administrator group using the MediaConnectAllAccess policy:


Choose Create New Group.


On the Set Group Name page, enter a name for the group, such as MediaConnectAdmins.


Choose Next Step.


On the Attach Policy page, for Filter, choose Customer Managed.


In the policy list, choose the MediaConnectAllAccess policy that you created in the procedure in Step 3a: Create a Policy.


Choose Next Step.


On the Review page, verify that the correct policies are added to this group, and then choose Create Group.


On the Groups page, create a read-only group using the MediaConnectReaders policy:


Choose Create New Group.


On the Set Group Name page, enter a name for the group, such as MediaConnectReaders.


Choose Next Step.


On the Attach Policy page, for Filter, choose Customer Managed.


In the policy list, choose the MediaConnectReadOnlyAccess policy that you created in the procedure in Step 3a: Create a Policy.


Choose Next Step.


On the Review page, verify that the correct policies are added to this group, and then choose Create Group.
