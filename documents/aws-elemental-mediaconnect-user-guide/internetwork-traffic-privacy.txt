Internetwork traffic privacy
To route traffic directly between MediaConnect and your corporate network via a virtual private cloud (VPC)


Set up a private connection between your Amazon VPC and your corporate network. Set up either an IPsec VPN connection over the internet or a private physical connection using AWS Direct Connect connection. AWS Direct Connect enables you to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premises network directly to your Amazon VPC, providing you with a private, high-bandwidth network connection between your network and your VPC. With multiple virtual interfaces, you can establish private connectivity to multiple VPCs while maintaining network isolation. For more information, see What is AWS Site-to-Site VPN? and What is AWS Direct Connect?


Create a flow that uses a VPC source. During this process, you add a VPC interface to your flow to establish the initial connection between your VPC and your flow. You also specify that same VPC interface as the source for the new flow.
Note
If your flow already exists, you can update the flow to add a VPC interface and then add another source that uses that VPC interface.
