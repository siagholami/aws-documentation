Removing outputs from a flow
You can remove outputs that you added to the flow. If AWS Elemental MediaConnect generated the output as the result of an entitlement, you must revoke the entitlement.
To remove an output from a flow (console)


Open the MediaConnect console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconnect/.


On the Flows page, choose the name of the flow that is associated with the output that you want to remove.


The details page for that flow appears. 


Choose the Outputs tab.


Choose the output, and then choose Remove.


To remove an output from a flow (AWS CLI)
 In the AWS CLI, use the remove-flow-output command:
aws mediaconnect remove-flow-output --flow-arn "arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-east-1:111122223333:flow:1-23aBC45dEF67hiJ8-12AbC34DE5fG:BasketballGame" --output-arn "arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-east-1:111122223333:output:2-3aBC45dEF67hiJ89-c34de5fG678h:Output1" --region us-west-2
The following example shows the return value:
{
      "FlowArn": "arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-east-1:111122223333:flow:1-23aBC45dEF67hiJ8-12AbC34DE5fG:BasketballGame",
      "OutputArn": "arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-east-1:111122223333:output:2-3aBC45dEF67hiJ89-c34de5fG678h:Output1"
  }
