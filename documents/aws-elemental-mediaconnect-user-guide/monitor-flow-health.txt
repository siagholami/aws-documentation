Monitoring a flow's health
The Alerts tab on the MediaConnect console displays a list of alerts that occurred when you started or stopped the current flow. For the full list of alerts for a flow, see Amazon CloudWatch
MediaConnect displays the following alerts on the Alerts tab:
 The entitlement that this flow is based on is already in use. This occurs if you create more than one flow based on the same entitlement. If the one of those flows is already running, MediaConnect displays an alert if you try to start the second flow.
 The entitlement that this flow is based on no longer exists. This occurs if the account that granted the entitlement (the content originator) revokes the entitlement.
 The entitlement that this flow is based on does not have an active source. This occurs if the originator's flow is deleted or stopped. When you start your flow based on that entitlement, there is no content coming from the originator's flow.
 The decryption or encryption information for the flow isn't valid. This can happen for a number of reasons. For example, the decryption key doesn't match the type for the specified algorithm. Or, your flow is based on an entitlement that uses SPEKE encryption and MediaConnect can't contact the conditional access (CA) platform key provider.
 Your flow is based on an entitlement, and the content originator's flow already has the maximum number of outputs.
