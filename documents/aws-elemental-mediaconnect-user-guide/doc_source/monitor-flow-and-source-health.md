# Monitoring flow and source health<a name="monitor-flow-and-source-health"></a>

On the AWS Elemental MediaConnect console, you can monitor the health of your flows and their sources\.

*Flow* health indicates if your flow is not connected due to an issue with an entitlement or encryption\.

*Source* health indicates if your source is connected\. If it is, the console shows Amazon CloudWatch metrics that provide the status of the source over a period of time\.
