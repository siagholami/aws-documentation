# Protocols in AWS Elemental MediaConnect<a name="protocols"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaConnect supports the following protocols for incoming \(source\) and outgoing \(output\) live video streams:
+ **Zixi** is a highly available protocol suitable for most applications, especially use cases that involve longer distances\. If your encoder is not capable of using Zixi, you can use the Zixi feeder/receiver software that was created specifically for use with MediaConnect\. You can access this software on the [Zixi website](http://www.zixi.com/aws-mediaconnect-download), where you will be asked to provide your information before you can download the software\. If you set up multiple flows for distribution, we recommend that you use Zixi as the protocol to send content between flows\. MediaConnect supports two Zixi protocol options:
  + **Zixi pull** uses the Zixi protocol to send content to a receiver or an integrated receiver decoder \(IRD\) that is behind a firewall\. Additionally, you can use this option when you need network address translation \(NAT\) to route the traffic from AWS Elemental MediaConnect to the receiver\.
  + **Zixi push** uses the Zixi protocol to send content to a receiver that has a static, publicly addressable IP address\. Use this option when the receiver is not behind a firewall or NAT\-based router\.
+ **Reliable Internet Stream Transport \(RIST\)** is a highly available, low\-latency protocol that is suitable for long\-distance applications\. AWS Elemental MediaConnect doesn't support encryption for sources or outputs that use the RIST protocol\.
+ **Real\-Time Transport Protocol with Forward Error Correction \(RTP\-FEC\)** has wide applicability and forward error correction \(FEC\) to self\-heal any corruption and packet loss\. Using this protocol takes more bandwidth than RTP without FEC\. AWS Elemental MediaConnect doesn't support encryption for sources or outputs that use the RTP\-FEC protocol\.
+ **Real\-Time Transport Protocol \(RTP\)** has wide applicability and takes less bandwidth than RTP\-FEC\. AWS Elemental MediaConnect doesn't support encryption for sources or outputs that use the RTP protocol\.
