# Disabling an entitlement temporarily<a name="entitlements-disable"></a>

When you disable an entitlement, the content becomes unavailable to the subscriber account immediately\. However, the entitlement and the associated output remain on your flow\. These resources continue to count toward your quota for outputs and entitlements\. Later, you can [enable the entitlement](entitlements-enable.md) to re\-instate access\.

If you want to stop streaming content to the subscriberâ€™s flow permanently, [revoke](entitlements-revoke.md) the entitlement instead\. That action removes the entitlement and the associated output from your flow\.
