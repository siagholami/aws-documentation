# Amazon Macie and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-macie"></a>

Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover, monitor, and help you protect your sensitive data in Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)\. Macie automates the discovery of sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information \(PII\) and intellectual property, to provide you with a better understanding of the data that your organization stores in Amazon S3\. For more information, see the [Amazon Macie User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user)\.

The following list provides information that is useful to know when you want to integrate Amazon Macie and AWS Organizations:
+ **To enable trusted access with AWS Organizations:** Amazon Macie requires trusted access to AWS Organizations before you can designate a member account to be the Macie administrator for your organization\. If you configure a delegated administrator using the Macie management console, then Macie automatically enables trusted access for you\. However, if you want to configure a delegated administrator account using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs, then you must explicitly call the [EnableAWSServiceAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_EnableAWSServiceAccess.html) operation and provide the service principal as a parameter\. Then you can call [EnableOrganizationAdminAccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/APIReference/admin.html#EnableOrganizationAdminAccount) to delegate the Macie administrator account\.
