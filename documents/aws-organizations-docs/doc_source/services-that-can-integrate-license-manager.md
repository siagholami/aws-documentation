# AWS License Manager and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-license-manager"></a>

AWS License Manager streamlines the process of bringing software vendor licenses to the cloud\. As you build out cloud infrastructure on AWS, you can save costs by using bring\-your\-own\-license \(BYOL\) opportunities—that is, by repurposing your existing license inventory for use with cloud resources\. With rule\-based controls on the consumption of licenses, administrators can set hard or soft limits on new and existing cloud deployments, stopping noncompliant server usage before it happens\. By linking License Manager with AWS Organizations, you can enable cross\-account discovery of computing resources throughout your organization\. For more information about License Manager, see the [License Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/userguide/)\.
