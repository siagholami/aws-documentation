# Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-guardduty"></a>

Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes a variety data sources, using threat intelligence feeds and machine learning to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity within your AWS environment\. This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IP addresses, URLs, or domains\. You can help simplify management of GuardDuty by using Organizations to manage GuardDuty across all of the accounts in your organization\. For more information, see [Managing GuardDuty accounts with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_organizations.htm) in the *Amazon GuardDuty User Guide*\.

The following list provides information that is useful to know when you want to integrate Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Organizations:
+ **To enable trusted access with AWS Organizations:** Amazon GuardDuty requires trusted access to AWS Organizations before you can designate a member account to be the GuardDuty administrator for your organization\. If you configure a delegated administrator using the AWS Management Console, then GuardDuty automatically enables trusted access for you\. However, if you want to configure a delegated administrator account using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs, then you must explicitly call the [EnableAWSServiceAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_EnableAWSServiceAccess.html) operation and provide the service principal as a parameter\. Then you can call [EnableOrganizationAdminAccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_EnableOrganizationAdminAccount.html) to delegate the GuardDuty administrator account\.
