# AWS Backup and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-backup"></a>

AWS Backup is a service that allows you to manage and monitor the AWS Backup jobs in your organization\. Using AWS Backup, if you sign\-in as a user in either the organization's master account or the AWS Backup delegated administrator account, you can enable organization\-wide backup protection and monitoring\. It helps you to achieve compliance by using [backup policies](orgs_manage_policies_backup.md) to centrally apply AWS Backup plans to resources across all of the accounts in your organization\. When you use both AWS Backup and AWS Organizations together, you can get the following benefits:

Protection  
You can [enable the backup policy type](orgs_manage_policies_enable-disable.md) in your organization and then [create backup policies](orgs_manage_policies_backup_create.md) to attach to the organization's root, OUs, or accounts\. A backup policy combines an AWS Backup plan with the other details required to apply the plan automatically to your accounts\.Policies that are directly attached to an account are merged with policies [inherited](orgs_manage_policies_inheritance_mgmt.md) from the organization's root and any parent OUs to create an [effective policy](orgs_manage_policies_backup_effective.md) that applies to the account\. The policy includes the ID of an IAM role that has permissions to run AWS Backup on the resources in your accounts\. AWS Backup uses the IAM role to perform the backup on your behalf as specified by the backup plan in the effective policy\.

Monitoring  
When you [enable trusted access for AWS Backup](orgs_integrate_services.md#orgs_how-to-enable-disable-trusted-access) in your organization, you can use the AWS Backup console to view details about the backup, restore, and copy jobs in any of the accounts in your organization\. For more information, see [Monitor your backup jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/monitor-and-verify-protected-resources.html) in the *AWS Backup Developer Guide*\.

For more information about AWS Backup, see the *[AWS Backup Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/)*\.

The following list provides information that is useful to know when you want to integrate AWS Backup and Organizations:
+ **To enable trusted access with AWS Organizations:** We recommend that you enable trusted access with AWS Backup by using the AWS Backup console\. For more information, see [Enabling Backup in Multiple AWS Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/manage-cross-account.html#enable-xaccount-management) in the *AWS Backup Developer Guide*\.
+ **To disable trusted access with AWS Organizations:** AWS Backup requires trusted access with AWS Organizations to enable monitoring of backup, restore, and copy jobs across your organization's accounts\. If you disable trusted access AWS Backup, you lose the ability to view jobs outside of the current account\. The AWS Backup role that AWS Backup creates remains\. If you later re\-enable trusted access, AWS Backup continues to operate as before, without the need for you to reconfigure the service\. To disable trusted access with AWS Backup, see [How to enable or disable trusted access](orgs_integrate_services.md#orgs_how-to-enable-disable-trusted-access)\.
