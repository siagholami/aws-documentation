# AWS Service Catalog and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-service-catalog"></a>

AWS Service Catalog enables you to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS\. The integration of AWS Service Catalog with AWS Organizations simplifies the sharing of portfolios and copying of products across an organization\. AWS Service Catalog administrators can reference an existing organization in AWS Organizations when sharing a portfolio, and they can share the portfolio with any trusted organizational unit \(OU\) in the organization's tree structure\. This eliminates the need to share portfolio IDs, and for the receiving account to manually reference the portfolio ID when importing the portfolio\. Portfolios shared via this mechanism are listed in the shared\-to account in the administrator’s **Imported Portfolio** view in AWS Service Catalog\. For more information about AWS Service Catalog, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/introduction.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/introduction.html)\.

The following list provides information that is useful to know when you want to integrate AWS Service Catalog and AWS Organizations:
+ **To enable trusted access with AWS Organizations:** Call the [AWSServiceCatalog::EnableAWSOrganizationsAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/dg/API_EnableAWSOrganizationsAccess.html) action or perform the action from the [ AWS Service Catalog console's](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog;) **Portfolio Sharing** page\. For more information, see [Portfolio Sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/catalogs_portfolios_sharing.html) in the *AWS Service Catalog Administrator Guide*\.
+ **To disable trusted access with AWS Organizations:** Call the [AWSServiceCatalog::DisableAWSOrganizationsAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/dg/API_DisableAWSOrganizationsAccess.html) action or perform the action from the [ AWS Service Catalog console's](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog;) **Portfolio Sharing** page\. If you disable trusted access using AWS Organizations while you are using AWS Service Catalog, it doesn't delete your current shares, but it prevents you from creating new shares throughout your organization\. Current shares won't be in sync with your organization structure if it changes after you call this action\.
