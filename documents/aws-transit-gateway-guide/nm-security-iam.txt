Identity and access management for Transit Gateway Network Manager
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps an administrator securely control access to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to use Transit Gateway Network Manager (Network Manager) resources. IAM is an AWS service that you can use with no additional charge. You can use features of IAM to allow other users, services, and applications to use your AWS resources fully or in a limited way, without sharing your security credentials.
By default, IAM users don't have permission to create, view, or modify AWS resources. To allow an IAM user to access resources, such as a global network, and perform tasks, you must:
 Create an IAM policy that grants the IAM user permission to use the specific resources and API actions they need
 Attach the policy to the IAM user or to the group to which the IAM user belongs
When you attach a policy to a user or group of users, it allows or denies the user permissions to perform the specified tasks on the specified resources.

How Network Manager works with IAM
With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources, and specify the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. Network Manager supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. For a complete list, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Network Manager in the IAM User Guide.
To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference in the IAM User Guide.
Actions
Policy actions in Network Manager use the following prefix before the action: networkmanager:. For example, to grant someone permission to create a global network with the CreateGlobalNetwork API operation, you include the networkmanager:CreateGlobalNetwork action in their policy. 
For a list of Network Manager actions, see the Network Manager API Reference.
Resources
The Resource element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. Statements must include either a Resource or a NotResource element. You specify a resource using an ARN or using the wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.
The global network resource has the following ARN.
arn:${Partition}:networkmanager::${Account}:global-network/${GlobalNetworkId}
For example, to specify the global-network-1122334455aabbccd global network in your statement, use the following ARN.
"Resource": "arn:aws:networkmanager::123456789012:global-network/global-network-1122334455aabbccd"
For more information about the format of ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces.
Condition keys
The Condition element (or Condition block) lets you specify conditions in which a statement is in effect. The Condition element is optional. You can build conditional expressions that use condition operators, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request. 
If you specify multiple Condition elements in a statement, or multiple keys in a single Condition element, AWS evaluates them using a logical AND operation. If you specify multiple values for a single condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical OR operation. All of the conditions must be met before the statement's permissions are granted.
You can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example, you can grant an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with their IAM user name. For more information, see IAM Policy Elements: Variables and Tags in the IAM User Guide. 
You can attach tags to Network Manager resources or pass tags in a request to Network Manager. To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the condition element of a policy using the aws:ResourceTag/key-name, aws:RequestTag/key-name, or aws:TagKeys condition keys. 
To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS Global Condition Context Keys in the IAM User Guide.
Network Manager also supports the following condition keys:
 networkmanager:tgwArn—Controls which transit gateways can be registered or deregistered in your global network.
 networkmanager:cgwArn—Controls which customer gateways can be associated or disassociated from devices and links in your global network.
Example policies to manage Transit Gateway Network Manager
The following are example IAM policies for working with Network Manager.
Administrator access
The following IAM policy grants full access to the Amazon EC2, Network Manager, AWS Direct Connect, and CloudWatch APIs. This enables administrators to create and manage transit gateways and their attachments (such as VPCs and AWS Direct Connect gateways), create and manage Network Manager resources, and monitor global networks using CloudWatch metrics and events. The policy also grants user permissions to create any required service-linked roles.

            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/*"
        }
    ]
}
Read-only access
The following IAM policy grants read-only access to the Amazon EC2, Network Manager, AWS Direct Connect, CloudWatch, and CloudWatch Events APIs. This enables users to use the Network Manager console to view and monitor global networks and their associated resources, and view metrics and events for the resources. Users cannot create or modify any resources.

}
Controlling the use of transit gateways and customer gateways
The following IAM policy enables users to work with Network Manager resources, but they are explicitly denied permission to do the following:
 Register or deregister a specific transit gateway (tgw-aabbccdd112233445) in the global network.
 Associate or disassociate a specific customer gateway (cgw-11223344556677abc) in the global network.
The policy uses the networkmanager:tgwArn and networkmanager:cgwArn condition keys to enforce these conditions.
