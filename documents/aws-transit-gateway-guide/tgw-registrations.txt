Transit gateway registrations
You can register your existing transit gateways with a global network. Any transit gateway attachments (such as VPCs, VPN connections, and AWS Direct Connect gateways) are automatically included in your global network.
You cannot create, delete, or modify your transit gateways and their attachments using the Network Manager console or APIs. To work with transit gateways, use the Amazon VPC console or the Amazon EC2 APIs.
You can register a transit gateway with one global network only. You can register transit gateways that are in the same AWS account as the global network.
