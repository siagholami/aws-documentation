On-premises network
You can represent your on-premises network in your global network through sites, devices, and links. For more information, see Defining and associating your on-premises network. You then associate a device with a site and one or more links.
To add your on-premises network to your global network, you associate a customer gateway with your device. For more information about viewing the topology of your on-premises network in Network Manager, see Topology.
All sites, devices, and links are created for a specific global network and cannot be shared with other global networks.
