Create a transit gateway multicast domain
To begin using multicast on a transit gateway, create a transit gateway multicast domain.
Before you create a multicast domain, create a new transit gateway that has multicast enabled. For more information, see Create a transit gateway.
To create a transit gateway multicast domain using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


On the navigation pane, choose Transit Gateway Multicast.


Choose Create Transit Gateway Multicast domain.


(Optional) For Name tag, enter a name to identify the domain.


For Transit Gateway ID, select the transit gateway that processes the multicast traffic.


Choose Create Transit Gateway Multicast Domain.


To create a transit gateway multicast domain using the AWS CLI
Use the create-transit-gateway-multicast-domain command.
Associate VPC attachments and subnets with a transit gateway multicast domain
Use the following procedure to associate a VPC attachment with a multicast domain. When you create an association, you can then select the subnets to include in the multicast domain. 
Before you begin, you must create a VPC attachment on your transit gateway. For more information, see Transit gateway attachments to a VPC.
To associate VPC attachments with a transit gateway multicast domain using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


On the navigation pane, choose Transit Gateway Multicast.


Select the transit gateway multicast domain, and then choose Actions, Create association.


For Transit Gateway ID, select the transit gateway attachment.


For Choose subnets to associate, select the subnets to include in the domain.


Choose Create association.


To associate VPC attachments with a transit gateway multicast domain using the AWS CLI
Use the associate-transit-gateway-multicast-domain command.
Register sources with a multicast group
Use the following procedure to register sources with a multicast group. The source is the network interface that sends multicast traffic.
You need the following information before you add a source:
 The ID of the transit gateway multicast domain
 The ID of the source network interface
 The multicast group IP address
To register sources using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


On the navigation pane, choose Transit Gateway Multicast.


Select the transit gateway multicast domain, and then choose Actions, Add group sources.


For Group IP address, enter either the IPv4 CIDR block or IPv6 CIDR block to assign to the multicast domain.


Under Choose network interfaces, select the multicast senders' network interfaces.


Choose Add sources.


To register sources using the AWS CLI
Use the register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-sources command.
Register members with a multicast group
Use the following procedure to register group members with a multicast group. The members are the network interfaces that receive multicast traffic.
You need the following information before you add members:
 The ID of the transit gateway multicast domain
 The IDs of the group members' network interfaces
 The multicast group IP address
To register members using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


On the navigation pane, choose Transit Gateway Multicast.


Select the transit gateway multicast domain, and then choose Actions, Add group members.


For Group IP address, enter either the IPv4 CIDR block or IPv6 CIDR block to assign to the multicast domain.


Under Choose network interfaces, select the multicast receivers' network interfaces.


Choose Add members.


To register members using the AWS CLI
Use the register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-sources command.
Deregister sources from a multicast group
Use the following procedure to remove a source from a multicast group.
To remove a source using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


On the navigation pane, choose Transit Gateway Multicast.


Select the transit gateway multicast domain.


Choose the Groups tab.


Select the sources, and then choose Remove source.


To remove a source using the AWS CLI
Use the deregister-transit-gateway-multicast-group-sources command.
Deregister members from a multicast group
Use the following procedure to deregister members from a multicast group. 
To deregister members using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


On the navigation pane, choose Transit Gateway Multicast.


Select the transit gateway multicast domain.


Choose the Groups tab.


Select the members, and then choose Remove member.


To deregister members using the AWS CLI
Use the deregister-transit-gateway-multicast-group-members command.
Disassociate subnets from a transit gateway multicast domain
Use the following procedure to disassociate subnets from a transit gateway multicast domain.
To disassociate subnets using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


On the navigation pane, choose Transit Gateway Multicast.


Select the transit gateway multicast domain.


Choose the Associations tab.


Select the subnet, and then choose Remove association.


To disassociate subnets using the AWS CLI
Use the disassociate-transit-gateway-multicast-domain command.
View your multicast groups
Use the following procedure to view your multicast groups.
To view multicast groups using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


On the navigation pane, choose Transit Gateway Multicast.


Select the transit gateway multicast domain.


Choose the Groups tab.


To view multicast groups using the AWS CLI
Use the view multicast groups  command.
View your transit gateway multicast domain associations
You can view your transit gateway multicast domains to verify that they are available, and that they contain the appropriate subnets and attachments.
To view a transit gateway multicast domain using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


On the navigation pane, choose Transit Gateway Multicast.


Select the transit gateway multicast domain.


To view a transit gateway multicast domain using the AWS CLI
Use the describe-transit-gateway-multicast-domains command.
Add or remove tags for a transit gateway multicast domain
Add tags to your resources to help organize and identify them, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. You can add multiple tags to each transit gateway multicast domain. Tag keys must be unique for each transit gateway multicast domain. If you add a tag with a key that is already associated with the transit gateway multicast domain, it updates the value of that tag. For more information, see Tagging your Amazon EC2 Resources.
Add tags to a transit gateway using the console


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


On the navigation pane, choose Transit Gateways Multicast.
