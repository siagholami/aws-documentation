Prefix list references
You can reference a prefix list in your transit gateway route table. A prefix list is a set of one or more CIDR block entries. You can use a prefix list to simplify the management of the IP addresses that you reference in your resources to route network traffic. For example, if you frequently specify the same destination CIDRs across multiple transit gateway route tables, you can manage those CIDRs in a single prefix list.
When you create a prefix list reference in your transit gateway route table, each entry in the prefix list is represented as a route in your transit gateway route table.
For more information about prefix lists, see Prefix lists in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
