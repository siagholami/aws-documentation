Component configuration sections
Component configuration includes several major sections. Sections in a component configuration can be in any order.
 alarmMetrics (optional)
A list of metrics to monitor for the component. All component types can have an alarmMetrics section. 
 logs (optional)
A list of logs to monitor for the component. Only EC2 instances can have a logs section. 
 instances (optional)
Nested instance configuration for the component. The following types of component can have nested instances and an instances section: ELB, ASG, and custom-grouped EC2 instances.
 alarms (optional)
A list of alarms to monitor for the component. All component types can have an alarm section.
The following example shows the syntax for the instances section fragment in JSON format.
{
  "alarmMetrics" : [
    list of alarm metrics
  ],
  "logs" : [
    list of logs
  ],
  "windowsEvents" : [
    list of windows events channels configurations
  ]
}

Topics
 Metric
 Log
 Windows Events
 Alarm
Metric
Defines a metric to be monitored for the component.
JSON 
{
  "alarmMetricName" : "monitoredMetricName",
  "monitor" : true/false
}
Properties
 alarmMetricName (required)
The name of the metric to be monitored for the component. For metrics supported by Application Insights, see Logs and metrics supported by Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights. 
 monitor (optional)
Boolean to indicate whether to monitor the metric. The default value is true.
Log
Defines a log to be monitored for the component.
JSON 
{
  "logGroupName" : "logGroupName",
  "logPath" : "logPath",
  "logType" : "logType",
  "encoding" : "encodingType",
  "monitor" : true/false
}
Properties
 logGroupName (required)
The CloudWatch log group name to be associated to the monitored log. For the log group name constraints, see CreateLogGroup.
 logPath (required for EC2 instance components; not required for components that do not use CloudWatch Agent, such as AWS Lambda)
The path of the logs to be monitored. The log path must be an absolute Windows system file path. For more information, see CloudWatch Agent Configuration File: Logs Section. 
 logType (required)
The log type decides the log patterns against which Application Insights analyzes the log. The log type is selected from the following: SQL_SERVER/IIS/APPLICATION/DEFAULT.
 encoding (optional)
The type of encoding of the logs to be monitored. The specified encoding should be included in the list of CloudWatch agent supported encodings. If not provided, CloudWatch Application Insights uses the default encoding type for the log type:
   For APPLICATION/DEFAULT: utf-8 encoding
   For SQL_SERVER: utf-16 encoding
   For IIS: ascii encoding
 monitor (optional)
Boolean that indicates whether to monitor the logs. The default value is true.
Windows Events

JSON 
{
  "logGroupName" : "logGroupName",
  "eventName" : "eventName",
  "eventLevels" : ["ERROR","WARNING","CRITICAL","INFORMATION","VERBOSE"],
  "monitor" : true/false
}
Properties
 logGroupName (required)
The CloudWatch log group name to be associated to the monitored log. For the log group name constraints, see CreateLogGroup.
