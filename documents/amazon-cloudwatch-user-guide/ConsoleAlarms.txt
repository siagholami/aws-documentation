Create a CloudWatch Alarm Based on a Static Threshold
You choose a CloudWatch metric for the alarm to watch, and the threshold for that metric. The alarm goes to ALARM state when the metric breaches the threshold for a specified number of evaluation periods.
CloudWatch has changed the alarm user interface. By default, you're shown the new user interface, but you can choose to return to the old user interface. This topic contains steps for each.
To create an alarm based on a single metric using the new alarms user interface


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Alarms, Create Alarm.


Choose Select Metric and do one of the following:
    Choose the service namespace that contains the metric that you want. Continue choosing options as they appear to narrow the choices. When a list of metrics appears, select the check box next to the metric that you want.
    In the search box, enter the name of a metric, dimension, or resource ID and press Enter. Then choose one of the results and continue until a list of metrics appears. Select the check box next to the metric that you want. 


Choose the Graphed metrics tab.


Under Statistic , choose one of the statistics or predefined percentiles, or specify a custom percentile (for example, p95.45).


Under Period, choose the evaluation period for the alarm. When evaluating the alarm, each period is aggregated into one data point.
You can also choose whether the y-axis legend appears on the left or right while you're creating the alarm. This preference is used only while you're creating the alarm.


Choose Select metric.
The Specify metric and conditions page appears, showing a graph and other information about the metric and statistic you have selected.


Under Conditions, specify the following:


Enter a name and description for the alarm. The name must contain only ASCII characters. 


For Whenever metric is, specify whether the metric must be greater than, less than, or equal to the threshold. Under than..., specify the threshold value.


Choose Additional configuration. For Datapoints to alarm, specify how many evaluation periods (data points) must be in the ALARM state to trigger the alarm. If the two values here match, you create an alarm that goes to ALARM state if that many consecutive periods are breaching.
To create an M out of N alarm, specify a lower number for the first value than you specify for the second value. For more information, see Evaluating an Alarm.


For Missing data treatment, choose how to have the alarm behave when some data points are missing. For more information, see Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms Treat Missing Data.


If the alarm uses a percentile as the monitored statistic, a Percentiles with low samples box appears. Use it to choose whether to evaluate or ignore cases with low sample rates. If you choose ignore (maintain alarm state), the current alarm state is always maintained when the sample size is too low. For more information, see Percentile-Based CloudWatch Alarms and Low Data Samples. 


Choose Next.


Under Notification, select an SNS topic to notify when the alarm is in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.


To have the alarm send multiple notifications for the same alarm state or for different alarm states, choose Add notification.
To have the alarm not send notifications, choose Remove.


To have the alarm perform Auto Scaling or EC2 actions, choose the appropriate button and choose the alarm state and action to perform.


When finished, choose Next.


Enter a name and description for the alarm. The name must contain only ASCII characters. Then choose Next.


Under Preview and create, confirm that the information and conditions are what you want, then choose Create alarm.


To use the older user interface to create an alarm based on a single metric


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Alarms, Create Alarm.


Choose Select Metric and do one of the following:
    Choose the service namespace that contains the metric that you want. Continue choosing options as they appear to narrow the choices. When a list of metrics appears, select the check box next to the metric that you want.
    In the search box, enter the name of a metric, dimension, or resource ID and press Enter. Then choose one of the results and continue until a list of metrics appears. Select the check box next to the metric that you want. 


Choose the Graphed metrics tab.


Under Statistic , choose one of the statistics or predefined percentiles, or specify a custom percentile (for example, p95.45).


Under Period, choose the evaluation period for the alarm. When evaluating the alarm, each period is aggregated into one data point.
You can also choose whether the y-axis legend appears on the left or right while you're creating the alarm. This preference is used only while you're creating the alarm.


Choose Select metric.


Enter a name and description for the alarm. The name must contain only ASCII characters. 


For Whenever, specify the alarm condition.


For is:, specify whether the metric must be greater than, less than, or equal to the threshold, and specify the threshold value.


For for:, specify how many evaluation periods (data points) must be in the ALARM state to trigger the alarm. Initially, you can change only the second value, and the first value changes to match your entry. This creates an alarm that goes to ALARM state if that many consecutive periods are breaching.
To create an M out of N alarm, choose the pencil icon. You can then change the M number to be different than the N number. For more information, see Evaluating an Alarm.


Under Additional settings, for Treat missing data as, choose how to have the alarm behave when some data points are missing. For more information, see Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms Treat Missing Data.


If the alarm uses a percentile as the monitored statistic, a Percentiles with low samples box appears. Use it to choose whether to evaluate or ignore cases with low sample rates. If you choose ignore (maintain the alarm state), the current alarm state is always maintained when the sample size is too low. For more information, see Percentile-Based CloudWatch Alarms and Low Data Samples. 


Under Actions, select the type of action to have the alarm to perform when the alarm is triggered. Use the Notification, AutoScaling Action, and EC2 Action buttons to have the alarm perform multiple actions. Specify at least one action.


Choose Create Alarm.


You can also add alarms to a dashboard. For more information, see Add an Alarm Widget to a CloudWatch Dashboard.
