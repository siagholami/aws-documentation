Visualizing Your Service Quotas and Setting Alarms
You can use the CloudWatch console to visualize your service quotas, and see how your current usage compares. You can also set alarms to be notified when you approach a quota.
To visualize a service quota and optionally set an alarm


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Metrics.


On the All metrics tab, choose Usage, then choose By AWS Resource.


The list of service quota usage metrics appears.

Select the check box next to one of the metrics.

The graph displays your current usage of that AWS resource.


To add your service quota to the graph, do the following:


Choose the Graphed metrics tab.


Choose Math expression, Start with an empty expression. Then in the new row, under Details, enter SERVICE_QUOTA(m1).
A new line is added to the graph, displaying the service quota for the resource represented in the metric.


To see your current usage as a percentage of the quota, add a new expression or change the current SERVICE_QUOTA expression. For the new expression, use m1/SERVICE_QUOTA(m1)*100


(Optional) To set an alarm that notifies you if you approach the service quota, do the following:


On the m1/SERVICE_QUOTA(m1)*100 row, under Actions, choose the alarm icon. It looks like a bell.
The alarm creation page appears.


Under Conditions, ensure that Threshold type is Static and Whenever Expression1 is is set to Greater. Under than, enter 80. This creates an alarm that goes into ALARM state when your usage exceeds 80 percent of the quota.


Choose Next.


On the next page, select an Amazon SNS topic or create a new one. This topic is notified when the alarm goes to ALARM state. Then choose Next.


On the next page, enter a name and description for the alarm, and then choose Next.


Choose Create alarm.
