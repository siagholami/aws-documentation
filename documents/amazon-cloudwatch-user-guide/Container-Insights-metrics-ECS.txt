Amazon ECS Container Insights Metrics
The following table lists the metrics and dimensions that Container Insights collects for Amazon ECS. These metrics are in the ECS/ContainerInsights namespace. For more information, see Metrics.
If you do not see any Container Insights metrics in your console, be sure that you have completed the setup of Container Insights. Metrics do not appear before Container Insights has been set up completely. For more information, see Setting Up Container Insights.
When you use Container Insights to collect the following metrics, the metrics are charged as custom metrics. For more information about CloudWatch pricing, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing. Amazon ECS also automatically sends several free metrics to CloudWatch. For more information, see  Available metrics and dimensions.
The following metrics are available when you complete the steps in Setting Up Container Insights on Amazon ECS for Cluster- and Service-Level Metrics



Metric Name
Dimensions
Description




ContainerInstanceCount
ClusterName
The number of EC2 instances running the Amazon ECS agent that are registered with a cluster. Unit: Count


CpuUtilized
TaskDefinitionFamily, ClusterName ServiceName, ClusterName ClusterName
The CPU units used by tasks in the resource that is specified by the dimension set that you're using. This metric is collected only for tasks that have a defined CPU reservation in their container definition.


CpuReserved
TaskDefinitionFamily, ClusterName ServiceName, ClusterName ClusterName
The CPU units reserved by tasks in the resource that is specified by the dimension set that you're using. This metric is collected only for tasks that have a defined CPU reservation in their task definition.


DeploymentCount
ServiceName, ClusterName
The number of deployments in an Amazon ECS service.


DesiredTaskCount
ServiceName, ClusterName
The desired number of tasks for an Amazon ECS service. Unit: Count


MemoryUtilized
TaskDefinitionFamily, ClusterName ServiceName, ClusterName ClusterName
The memory being used by tasks in the resource that is specified by the dimension set that you're using. This metric is collected only for tasks that have a defined memory reservation in their task definition.


MemoryReserved
TaskDefinitionFamily, ClusterName ServiceName, ClusterName ClusterName
The memory that is reserved by tasks in the resource that is specified by the dimension set that you're using. This metric is collected only for tasks that have a defined memory reservation in their task definition.


NetworkRxBytes
TaskDefinitionFamily, ClusterName ServiceName, ClusterName ClusterName
The number of bytes received by the resource that is specified by the dimensions that you're using. This metric is available only for containers in tasks using the awsvpc or bridge network modes. Unit: Bytes/Second


NetworkTxBytes
TaskDefinitionFamily, ClusterName ServiceName, ClusterName ClusterName
The number of bytes transmitted by the resource that is specified by the dimensions that you're using. This metric is available only for containers in tasks using the awsvpc or bridge network modes. Unit: Bytes/Second


PendingTaskCount
ServiceName, ClusterName
The number of tasks currently in the PENDING state. Unit: Count


RunningTaskCount
ServiceName, ClusterName
The number of tasks currently in the RUNNING state. Unit: Count


ServiceCount
ClusterName
The number of services in the cluster. Unit: Count


StorageReadBytes
TaskDefinitionFamily, ClusterName ServiceName, ClusterName ClusterName
The number of bytes read from storage in the resource that is specified by the dimensions that you're using. Unit: Bytes


StorageWriteBytes
TaskDefinitionFamily, ClusterName ServiceName, ClusterName ClusterName
The number of bytes written to storage in the resource that is specified by the dimensions that you're using. Unit: Bytes


TaskCount
ClusterName
The number of tasks running in the cluster. Unit: Count


TaskSetCount
ServiceName, ClusterName
The number of task sets in the service. Unit: Count
