Service Quotas Integration and Usage Metrics
You can use CloudWatch to proactively manage your AWS service quotas. CloudWatch usage metrics provide visibility into your account's usage of resources and API operations.
You can use these metrics to visualize your current service usage on CloudWatch graphs and dashboards. You can use a CloudWatch metric math function to display the service quotas for those resources on your graphs. You can also configure alarms that alert you when your usage approaches a service quota.
For more information about service quotas, see What Is Service Quotas in the Service Quotas User Guide.
Currently, the following services provide usage metrics that you can use to evaluate your service quotas:
 AWS CloudHSM
 Amazon CloudWatch
 Amazon DynamoDB
 Amazon EC2
 Amazon Elastic Container Registry
 AWS Fargate
 AWS Key Management Service
 Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
 AWS Robomaker
All of these services publish their usage metrics in the AWS/Usage metric namespace.
