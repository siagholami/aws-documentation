Link and Unlink Graphs on a CloudWatch Dashboard
You can link the graphs on your dashboard together, so that when you zoom in or zoom out on one graph, the other graphs zoom in or zoom out at the same time. You can unlink graphs to limit zoom to one graph.

Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.
