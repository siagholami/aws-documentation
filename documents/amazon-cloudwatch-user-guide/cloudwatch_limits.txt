GetMetricData
50 TPS per Region. The maximum number of operation requests you can make per second without being throttled. You can request a quota increase. 180,000 Datapoints Per Second (DPS) if the StartTime used in the API request is less than or equal to three hours from current time. 396,000 DPS if the StartTime is more than three hours from current time. This is the maximum number of datapoints you can request per second using one or more API calls without being throttled. This quota cannot be changed. The DPS is calculated based on estimated data points, not actual data points. The data point estimate is caculated using the requested time range, period, and retention period. This means that if the actual data points in the requested metrics are sparse or empty, throttling still occurs if the estimated data points exceed the quota. The DPS quota is per-Region.
