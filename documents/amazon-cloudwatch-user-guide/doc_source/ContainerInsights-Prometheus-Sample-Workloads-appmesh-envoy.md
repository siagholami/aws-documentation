# \(Optional\) Enable App Mesh Envoy Access Logs<a name="ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Sample-Workloads-appmesh-envoy"></a>

You can set up Container Insights FluentD to send App Mesh Envoy access logs to CloudWatch Logs\. For more information, see [Access logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/envoy.html#envoy-logs)\.

**To have Envoy access logs sent to CloudWatch Logs**

1. Set up FluentD in the cluster\. For more information, see [Set Up FluentD as a DaemonSet to Send Logs to CloudWatch Logs](Container-Insights-setup-logs.md)\.

1. Configure Envoy access logs for your virtual nodes\. For instructions, see [Configure Envoy access logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/observability.html#envoy-logs)\. Be sure to configure the log path to be **/dev/stdout** in each virtual node\.

When you have finished, the envoy access logs are sent to the `/aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/application` log group\.
