# Using Contributor Insights to Analyze High\-Cardinality Data<a name="ContributorInsights"></a>

You can use Contributor Insights to analyze log data and create time series that display contributor data\. You can see metrics about the top\-N contributors, the total number of unique contributors, and their usage\. This helps you find top talkers and understand who or what is impacting system performance\. For example, you can find bad hosts, identify the heaviest network users, or find the URLs that generate the most errors\.

You can build your rules from scratch, and when you use the AWS Management Console you can also use sample rules that AWS has created\. Rules define the log fields that you want to use to define contributors, such as `IpAddress`\. You can also filter the log data to find and analyze the behavior of individual contributors\.

CloudWatch also provides built\-in rules that you can use to analyze metrics from other AWS services\. Currently, built\-in rules are available for Amazon DynamoDB\.

All rules analyze incoming data in real time\.

**Note**  
If you use Contributor Insights, you are charged for each occurrence of a log event that matches a rule\. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)\.
