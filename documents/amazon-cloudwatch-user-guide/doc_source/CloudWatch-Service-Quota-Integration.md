# Service Quotas Integration and Usage Metrics<a name="CloudWatch-Service-Quota-Integration"></a>

You can use CloudWatch to proactively manage your AWS service quotas\. CloudWatch usage metrics provide visibility into your account's usage of resources and API operations\.

You can use these metrics to visualize your current service usage on CloudWatch graphs and dashboards\. You can use a CloudWatch metric math function to display the service quotas for those resources on your graphs\. You can also configure alarms that alert you when your usage approaches a service quota\.

For more information about service quotas, see [What Is Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.
