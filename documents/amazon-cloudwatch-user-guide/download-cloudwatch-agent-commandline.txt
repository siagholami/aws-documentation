Download the CloudWatch Agent Package Using an S3 Download Link
You can use an Amazon S3 download link to download the CloudWatch agent package. Choose the download link from this table, depending on your architecture and platform.
For each download link, there is a general link as well as links for each Region. For example, for Amazon Linux and Amazon Linux 2 and the AMD64 architecture, three of the valid download links are:
 https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/amazon_linux/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
 https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent-us-east-1/amazon_linux/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
 https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent-eu-central-1/amazon_linux/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
You can also download a README file about the latest changes to the agent, and a file that indicates the version number that is available for download. These files are in the following locations:
 https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/info/latest/RELEASE_NOTES or https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent-Region/info/latest/RELEASE_NOTES
 https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/info/latest/CWAGENT_VERSION or https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent-Region/info/latest/CWAGENT_VERSION
