Creating a Contributor Insights Rule
You can create rules to analyze log data. Any logs in JSON or Common Log Format (CLF) can be evaluated. This includes your custom logs that follow one of these formats and logs from AWS services such as Amazon VPC flow logs, Amazon Route 53 DNS query logs, Amazon ECS container logs, and logs from AWS CloudTrail, Amazon SageMaker, Amazon RDS, AWS AppSync and API Gateway.
In a rule, when you specify field names or values, all matching is case sensitive.
You can use built-in sample rules when you create a rule or you can create your own rule from scratch. Contributor Insights includes sample rules for the following types of logs:
 Amazon API Gateway logs
 Amazon Route 53 public DNS query logs
 Amazon Route 53 resolver query logs
 CloudWatch Container Insights logs
 VPC flow logs
To create a rule using a built-in sample rule


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Contributor Insights.


Choose Create rule.


Choose Sample rule, and from Select sample rule, select the rule.


For Rule name, enter a name. Valid characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-", "_', and ".".


For Log group(s), select the log groups that you want the rule to monitor. You can select as many as 20 log groups.


To select all log groups with names that start with a certain string, choose Select by prefix match and enter the prefix.
If you use Select by prefix match, be aware of how many log groups will match your prefix and be analyzed by the rule. You incur charges for each log event that matches a rule. If you accidentally search more log groups than you intend, you might incur unexpected charges. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing.


The sample rule has filled out the Fields, Contribution, Filters, and Aggregate on fields. You can adjust those values, if you like.


Choose whether to create the rule in a disabled or enabled state. If you choose to enable it, the rule immediately starts analyzing your data. You incur costs when you run enabled rules. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing.


Contributor Insights analyzes only new log events after a rule is created. A rule cannot process logs events that were previously processed by CloudWatch Logs.

Choose Create.

To create a rule from scratch


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Contributor Insights.


Choose Create rule.


In the Create rule wizard, choose Custom rule.


For Rule name, enter a name. Valid characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-", "_', and ".".


You can finish creating the rule by using the wizard or by choosing the Syntax tab and specifying your rule syntax manually.


To continue using the wizard, do the following:


For Log group(s), select the log groups that you want the rule to monitor. You can select as many as 20 log groups.
To select all log groups with names that start with a certain string, choose Select by prefix match and enter that prefix.
If you use Select by prefix match, be aware of how many log groups will match your prefix and be analyzed by the rule. You incur charges for each log event that matches a rule. If you accidentally search more log groups than you intend, you might incur unexpected charges. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing.


For Log format, choose JSON or CLF.


For Contribution, Key, enter a contributor type that you want to report on. The report displays the top-N values for this contributor type.
Valid entries are any log field that has values. Examples include requestId, sourceIPaddress, and containerID.
For information about finding the log field names for the logs in a certain log group, see .
Keys larger than 1 KB are truncated to 1KB.


(Optional) Add more values for Contribution, Key. You can include as many as four keys in a rule. If you enter more than one key, the contributors in the report are defined by unique value combinations of the keys. For example, if you specify three keys, each unique combination of values for the three keys is counted as a unique contributor.


(Optional) If you want to rank contributors by the value of a numerical log field, instead of by number of occurrences in log events, use the Contribution, Value field. Enter the name of a numerical log field that you want to sum to determine contributor ranking. For example, if you want to find the source IP addresses that are sending the most bytes over the network, you would add bytes as the value, assuming that bytes is the correct keyword for that field in the log events.


If you want to filter the results to a narrower scope, choose Add filter. For Match, enter the log field that you want to filter by. For Condition, choose the comparison operator and enter a value that you want to filter this field for. You can use * as a wildcard in the value.
For example, if you want to analyze only the log events in an Apache log that contain errors, for Match, you would specify RESPONSE_CODE, for Condition, you would specify EqualTo, and then you would enter 5** as the value to filter for.
You can add as many as 10 filters in a rule. Multiple filters are joined by AND logic, so only log events that match all filters are evaluated.


For Aggregate on, choose COUNT or SUM. Choosing COUNT causes the contributor ranking to be based on the number of occurrences. Choosing SUM causes the ranking to be based on the aggregated sum of the values of the field that you specify for Contribution, Value.


To enter your rule as a JSON object instead of using the wizard, do the following:


Choose the Syntax tab.


In Rule body, enter the JSON object for your rule. For information about rule syntax, see Contributor Insights Rule Syntax. 


Choose whether to create the rule in a disabled or enabled state. If you choose to enable it, the rule immediately starts analyzing your data. You incur costs when you run enabled rules. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing.


Contributor Insights analyzes only new log events after a rule is created. A rule cannot process logs events that were previously processed by CloudWatch Logs.

Choose Create.

You can disable, enable, or delete rules that you have created.
To enable, disable, or delete a rule in Contributor Insights


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Contributor Insights.


In the list of rules, select the check box next to a single rule.


Built-in rules are created by AWS services and can't be edited, disabled, or deleted.

Choose Actions, and then choose the option you want.

Finding Log Fields
When you create a rule, you need to know the names of fields in the log entries in a log group.
To find the log fields in a log group


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, under Logs, choose Insights.


Above the query editor, select one or more log groups to query.


When you select a log group, CloudWatch Logs Insights automatically detects fields in the data in the log group and displays them in the right pane in Discovered fields.
