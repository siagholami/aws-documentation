Add or Remove a Graph from a CloudWatch Dashboard
You can add graphs containing one or more metrics to your dashboard for the resources you monitor. You can remove the graphs when they're no longer needed.
To add a graph to a dashboard


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Dashboards and select a dashboard.


Choose Add widget.


Choose the type of graph you want: Line, Stacked area, Bar, or Pie. Then choose Next.


Choose Metrics and then choose Configure.


In the All metrics tab, select the metrics to graph. If a specific metric doesn't appear in the dialog box because it hasn't published data in more than 14 days, you can add it manually. For more information, see Graph Metrics Manually on a CloudWatch Dashboard.


(Optional) To change the type of graph, choose Graph options. You can then choose between a line graph, stacked area chart, bar chart, pie chart, or number.


(Optional) As you choose metrics to graph, you can specify a dynamic label to appear on the graph legend for each metric. Dynamic labels display a statistic about the metric and automatically update when the dashboard or graph is refreshed. To add a dynamic label, choose Graphed metrics and then Dynamic labels.


By default, the dynamic values you add to the label appear at the beginning of the label. You can then choose the Label value for the metric to edit the label. For more information, see Using Dynamic Labels.


(Optional) As you choose metrics to graph, you can change their color on the graph. To do so, choose Graphed metrics and select the color square next to the metric to display a color picker box. Choose another color square in the color picker. Click outside the color picker to see your new color on the graph. Alternatively, in the color picker, you can enter the six-digit standard HTML hex color code for the color you want and press ENTER.


(Optional) To view more information about the metric being graphed, hover over the legend.


(Optional) To change the widget type, hover over the title area of the graph and choose Widget actions, Widget type.


(Optional) To change the statistic used for a metric, choose Graphed metrics, Statistic, and select the statistic you want to use. For more information, see Statistics.


(Optional) To change the time range shown on the graph, choose either custom at the top of the graph or one of the time periods to the left of custom.


 (Optional) Horizontal annotations help dashboard users quickly see when a metric has spiked to a certain level, or whether the metric is within a predefined range. To add a horizontal annotation, choose Graph options, Add horizontal annotation:


For Label, enter a label for the annotation.


For Value, enter the metric value where the horizontal annotation appears.


For Fill, specify whether to use fill shading with this annotation. For example, choose Above or Below for the corresponding area to be filled. If you specify Between, another Value field appears, and the area of the graph between the two values is filled.


For Axis, specify whether the numbers in Value refer to the metric associated with the left y-axis or the right y-axis, if the graph includes multiple metrics.
You can change the fill color of an annotation by choosing the color square in the left column of the annotation. 


Repeat these steps to add multiple horizontal annotations to the same graph.
To hide an annotation, clear the check box in the left column for that annotation.
To delete an annotation, choose x in the Actions column.


 (Optional) Vertical annotations help you mark milestones in a graph, such as operational events or the beginning and end of a deployment. To add a vertical annotation, choose Graph options, Add vertical annotation:


For Label, enter a label for the annotation. To show only the date and time on the annotation, keep the Label field blank.


For Date, specify the date and time where the vertical annotation appears.


For Fill, specify whether to use fill shading before or after a vertical annotation or between two vertical annotations. For example, choose Before or After for the corresponding area to be filled. If you specify Between, another Date field appears, and the area of the graph between the two values is filled.


Repeat these steps to add multiple vertical annotations to the same graph.
To hide an annotation, clear the check box in the left column for that annotation.
To delete an annotation, choose x in the Actions column.


Choose Create widget.


Choose Save dashboard.
