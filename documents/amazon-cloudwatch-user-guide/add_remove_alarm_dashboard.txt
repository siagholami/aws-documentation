Add an Alarm Widget to a CloudWatch Dashboard
To add an alarm widget to a dashboard, you have two options.
 You can add a single alarm in a widget, which displays both the graph of the alarm's metric and the alarm status.
 You can add an alarm status widget, which displays the status of multiple alarms in a grid. Only the alarm names and current status are displayed; the graphs are not displayed. Up to 100 alarms can be included in one alarm status widget.
