CloudWatch Dashboard Permissions Update
On May 1, 2018, AWS changed the permissions required to access CloudWatch dashboards. Dashboard access in the CloudWatch console now requires permissions that were introduced in 2017 to support dashboard API operations:
 cloudwatch:GetDashboard
 cloudwatch:ListDashboards
 cloudwatch:PutDashboard
 cloudwatch:DeleteDashboards
To access CloudWatch dashboards, you need one of the following:
 The AdministratorAccess policy.
 The CloudWatchFullAccess policy.
 A custom policy that includes one or more of these specific permissions:
   cloudwatch:GetDashboard and cloudwatch:ListDashboards to be able to view dashboards
   cloudwatch:PutDashboard to be able to create or modify dashboards
   cloudwatch:DeleteDashboards to be able to delete dashboards
