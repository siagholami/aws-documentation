Install the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus metrics collection on Amazon EKS and Kubernetes clusters
Before following these steps to install the CloudWatch agent for Prometheus metric collection, you must have a cluster running on Amazon EKS or a Kubernetes cluster running on an Amazon EC2 instance.

 Installing the CloudWatch Agent to Collect Prometheus Metrics
Setting Up IAM Roles
The first step is to set up the necessary IAM policy in the cluster. You do this by adding the policy to the IAM role used for the cluster.
To set up the IAM policy in a cluster for Prometheus support


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


In the navigation pane, choose Instances.


You need to find the prefix of the IAM role name for the cluster. To do this, select the check box next to the name of an instance that is in the cluster, and choose Actions, Instance Settings, Attach/Replace IAM Role. Then copy the prefix of the IAM role, such as eksctl-dev303-workshop-nodegroup.


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Roles.


Use the search box to find the prefix that you copied earlier in this procedure, and choose that role.


Choose Attach policies.


Use the search box to find CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy. Select the check box next to CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy, and choose Attach policy.


Installing the CloudWatch Agent to Collect Prometheus Metrics
You must install the CloudWatch agent in the cluster to collect the metrics. How to install the agent differs for Amazon EKS clusters and Kubernetes clusters.
Delete Previous Versions of the CloudWatch Agent with Prometheus Support
If you have already installed a version of the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus support in your cluster, you must delete that version by entering the following command. This is necessary only for previous versions of the agent with Prometheus support. You do not need to delete the CloudWatch agent that enables Container Insights without Prometheus support.
kubectl delete deployment cwagent-prometheus -n amazon-cloudwatch
Installing the CloudWatch Agent on Amazon EKS
To install the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus support on an Amazon EKS cluster, follow these steps.
To install the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus support on an Amazon EKS cluster

Enter the following command to check whether the amazon-cloudwatch namespace has already been created:

kubectl get namespace

If amazon-cloudwatch is not displayed in the results, create it by entering the following command:

kubectl create namespace amazon-cloudwatch

To deploy the agent with the default configuration and have it send data to the AWS Region that it is installed in, enter the following command:

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/master/k8s-deployment-manifest-templates/deployment-mode/service/cwagent-prometheus/prometheus-eks.yaml
To have the agent send data to a different Region instead, follow these steps:


Download the YAML file for the agent by entering the following command:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/prometheus-beta/k8s-deployment-manifest-templates/deployment-mode/service/cwagent-prometheus/prometheus-eks.yaml


Open the file with a text editor, and search for the cwagentconfig.json block of the file.


Add the highlighted lines, specifying the Region that you want:
cwagentconfig.json: |
      {
        "agent": {
          "region": "us-east-2"
        },
        "logs": { ...


Save the file and deploy the agent using your updated file.
kubectl apply -f prometheus-eks.yaml


Installing the CloudWatch Agent on a Kubernetes Cluster
To install the CloudWatch agent with Prometheus support on a cluster running Kubernetes, enter the following command:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/master/k8s-deployment-manifest-templates/deployment-mode/service/cwagent-prometheus/prometheus-k8s.yaml | 
sed "s/{{cluster_name}}/MyCluster/;s/{{region_name}}/region/" | 
kubectl apply -f -
Replace MyCluster with the name of the cluster. This name is used in the log group name that stores the log events collected by the agent, and is also used as a dimension for the metrics collected by the agent.
Replace region with the name of the AWS Region where you want the metrics to be sent. For example, us-west-1.
Verify that the Agent is Running
On both Amazon EKS and Kubernetes clusters, you can enter the following command to confirm that the agent is running.
kubectl get pod -l "app=cwagent-prometheus" -n amazon-cloudwatch
If the results include a single CloudWatch agent pod in the Running state, the agent is running and collecting Prometheus metrics. By default the CloudWatch agent collects metrics for App Mesh, NGINX, Memcached, Java/JMX, and HAProxy every minute. For more information about those metrics, see Prometheus Metrics Collected by the CloudWatch Agent. For instructions on how to see your Prometheus metrics in CloudWatch, see Viewing Your Prometheus Metrics 
You can also configure the CloudWatch agent to collect metrics from other Prometheus exporters. For more information, see Configuring the CloudWatch Agent for Prometheus Monitoring.
