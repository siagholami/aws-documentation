Using CloudWatch and CloudWatch Synthetics with Interface VPC Endpoints
If you use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to host your AWS resources, you can establish a private connection between your VPC, CloudWatch, and CloudWatch Synthetics. You can use these connections to enable CloudWatch and CloudWatch Synthetics to communicate with your resources on your VPC without going through the public internet.
Amazon VPC is an AWS service that you can use to launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. With a VPC, you have control over your network settings, such the IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways. To connect your VPC to CloudWatch or CloudWatch Synthetics, you define an interface VPC endpoint to connect your VPC to AWS services. The endpoint provides reliable, scalable connectivity to CloudWatch or CloudWatch Synthetics without requiring an internet gateway, network address translation (NAT) instance, or VPN connection. For more information, see What Is Amazon VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, an AWS technology that enables private communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IP addresses. For more information, see the New – AWS PrivateLink for AWS Services blog post.
The following steps are for users of Amazon VPC. For more information, see Getting Started in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

Creating a VPC Endpoint for CloudWatch
To start using CloudWatch with your VPC, create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch. The service name to choose is com.amazonaws.region.monitoring. For more information, see Creating an Interface Endpoint in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
You do not need to change the settings for CloudWatch. CloudWatch calls other AWS services using either public endpoints or private interface VPC endpoints, whichever are in use. For example, if you create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch, and you already have metrics flowing to CloudWatch from resources located on your VPC, these metrics begin flowing through the interface VPC endpoint by default.
Controlling Access to Your CloudWatch VPC Endpoint
A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint when you create or modify the endpoint. If you don't attach a policy when you create an endpoint, Amazon VPC attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service. An endpoint policy doesn't override or replace IAM user policies or service-specific policies. It's a separate policy for controlling access from the endpoint to the specified service. 
Endpoint policies must be written in JSON format. 
For more information, see Controlling Access to Services with VPC Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
The following is an example of an endpoint policy for CloudWatch. This policy allows users connecting to CloudWatch through the VPC to send metric data to CloudWatch and prevents them from performing other CloudWatch actions.
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PutOnly",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
To edit the VPC endpoint policy for CloudWatch


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Endpoints.


If you have not already created the endpoint for CloudWatch, choose Create Endpoint. Select com.amazonaws.region.monitoring, and then choose Create endpoint.


Select the com.amazonaws.region.monitoring endpoint, and then choose the Policy tab.


Choose Edit Policy, and then make your changes.


CloudWatch Synthetics VPC Endpoint
CloudWatch Synthetics currently supports VPC endpoints in the following AWS Regions:
 US East (Ohio)
 US East (N. Virginia)
 US West (N. California)
 US West (Oregon)
 Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)
 Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
 Asia Pacific (Seoul)
 Asia Pacific (Singapore)
 Asia Pacific (Sydney)
 Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
 Canada (Central)
 Europe (Frankfurt)
 Europe (Ireland)
 Europe (London)
 Europe (Paris)
 South America (São Paulo)
Creating a VPC Endpoint for CloudWatch Synthetics
To start using CloudWatch Synthetics with your VPC, create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Synthetics. The service name to choose is com.amazonaws.region.synthetics. For more information, see Creating an Interface Endpoint in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
You do not need to change the settings for CloudWatch Synthetics. CloudWatch Synthetics communicates with other AWS services using either public endpoints or private interface VPC endpoints, whichever are in use. For example, if you create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Synthetics, and you already have an interface endpoint for Amazon S3, CloudWatch Synthetics begins communicating with Amazon S3 through the interface VPC endpoint by default.
Controlling Access to Your CloudWatch Synthetics VPC Endpoint
A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint when you create or modify the endpoint. If you don't attach a policy when you create an endpoint, we attach a default policy for you that allows full access to the service. An endpoint policy doesn't override or replace IAM user policies or service-specific policies. It's a separate policy for controlling access from the endpoint to the specified service. 
Endpoint policies must be written in JSON format. 
For more information, see Controlling Access to Services with VPC Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
The following is an example of an endpoint policy for CloudWatch Synthetics. This policy enables users connecting to CloudWatch Synthetics through the VPC to view information about canaries and their runs, but not to create, modify, or delete canaries.
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "synthetics:DescribeCanaries",
                "synthetics:GetCanaryRuns"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Principal": "*"
        }
    ]
}
To edit the VPC endpoint policy for CloudWatch Synthetics


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Endpoints.


If you have not already created the endpoint for CloudWatch Synthetics, choose Create Endpoint. Select com.amazonaws.region.synthetics and then choose Create endpoint.


Select the com.amazonaws.region.synthetics endpoint and then choose the Policy tab.


Choose Edit Policy, and then make your changes.
