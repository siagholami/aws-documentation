Managing and configuring Elastic Beanstalk applications
The first step in using AWS Elastic Beanstalk is to create an application, which represents your web application in AWS. In Elastic Beanstalk an application serves as a container for the environments that run your web app and for versions of your web app's source code, saved configurations, logs, and other artifacts that you create while using Elastic Beanstalk.
To create an application


Open the Elastic Beanstalk console, and in the Regions list, select your AWS Region.


In the navigation pane, choose Applications, and then choose Create a new application.


Use the on-screen form to provide an application name.


Optionally, provide a description, and add tag keys and values.


Choose Create.



After creating the application, the console prompts you to create an environment for it. For detailed information about all of the options available, see Creating an Elastic Beanstalk environment.
If you no longer need an application, you can delete it.
Warning
Deleting an application terminates all associated environments and deletes all application versions and saved configurations that belong to the application.
To delete an application


Open the Elastic Beanstalk console, and in the Regions list, select your AWS Region.


In the navigation pane, choose Applications, and then select your application on the list.


Choose Actions, and then choose Delete application.
