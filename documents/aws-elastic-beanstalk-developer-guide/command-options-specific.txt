Platform specific options
Some Elastic Beanstalk platforms define option namespaces that are specific to the platform. These namespaces and their options are listed below for each platform.
Note
Previously, in platform versions based on Amazon Linux AMI (preceding Amazon Linux 2), the following two features and their respective namespaces were considered to be platform-specific features, and were listed here per platform:
Proxy configuration for static files – aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:staticfiles
AWS X-Ray support – aws:elasticbeanstalk:xray
In Amazon Linux 2 platform versions, Elastic Beanstalk implements these features in a consistent way across all supporting platforms. The related namespace are now listed in the General options for all environments page. We only kept mention of them on this page for platforms who had differently-named namespaces.

Go platform options
Amazon Linux AMI (pre-Amazon Linux 2) platform options
Namespace: aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:golang:staticfiles
You can use the following namespace to configure the proxy server to serve static files. When the proxy server receives a request for a file under the specified path, it serves the file directly instead of routing the request to your application. This reduces the number of requests that your application has to process.
Map a path served by the proxy server to a folder in your source code that contains static assets. Each option that you define in this namespace maps a different path.



Name
Value




Path where the proxy server will serve the files. Example: /images to serve files at subdomain.eleasticbeanstalk.com/images.
Name of the folder containing the files. Example: staticimages to serve files from a folder named staticimages at the top level of your source bundle.



Java SE platform options
Amazon Linux AMI (pre-Amazon Linux 2) platform options

You can use the following namespace to configure the proxy server to serve static files. When the proxy server receives a request for a file under the specified path, it serves the file directly instead of routing the request to your application.

ProxyServer
Set the proxy to use on your environment's instances. If you set this option to apache, Elastic Beanstalk uses Apache 2.4. Set to apache/2.2 if your application isn't ready to migrate away from Apache 2.2 due to incompatible proxy configuration settings. This value is only valid on Amazon Linux AMI (preceding Amazon Linux 2) platform versions. Set to nginx to use nginx. This is the default starting with Amazon Linux 2 platform versions. For more information, see Configuring your Tomcat environment's proxy server.

NodeCommand
Command used to start the Node.js application. If an empty string is specified, app.js is used, then server.js, then npm start in that order.

n/a


NodeVersion
Version of Node.js. For example, 4.4.6 Supported Node.js versions vary between Node.js platform versions. See Node.js in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Platforms document for a list of the currently supported versions.  When support for the version of Node.js that you are using is removed from the platform, you must change or remove the version setting prior to doing a platform update. This might occur when a security vulnerability is identified for one or more versions of Node.js. When this happens, attempting to update to a new version of the platform that doesn't support the configured NodeVersion fails. To avoid needing to create a new environment, change the NodeVersion configuration option to a Node.js version that is supported by both the old platform version and the new one, or remove the option setting, and then perform the platform update.
