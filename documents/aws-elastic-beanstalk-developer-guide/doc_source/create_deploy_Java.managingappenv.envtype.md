# Changing environment type<a name="create_deploy_Java.managingappenv.envtype"></a>

In AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, the **Environment Type** section of your environment's **Configuration** tab lets you select either **Load balanced, auto scaled** or a **Single instance** environment, depending on the requirements of the application that you deploy\. For an application that requires scalability, select **Load balanced, auto scaled**\. For a simple, low traffic application, select **Single instance**\. For more information, see [Environment types](using-features-managing-env-types.md)\.
