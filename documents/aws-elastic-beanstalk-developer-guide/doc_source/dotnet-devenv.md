If you need to manage AWS resources from within your application, install the AWS SDK for \.NET\. For example, you can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve data\.

With the AWS SDK for \.NET, you can get started in minutes with a single, downloadable package complete with Visual Studio project templates, the AWS \.NET library, C\# code samples, and documentation\. Practical examples are provided in C\# for how to use the libraries to build applications\. Online video tutorials and reference documentation are provided to help you learn how to use the libraries and code samples\.

Visit the [AWS SDK for \.NET homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/) for more information and installation instructions\.
