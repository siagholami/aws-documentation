Now that you know how to create an Elastic Beanstalk application and environment, we recommend that you read [Elastic Beanstalk concepts](concepts.md)\. This topic provides information about the Elastic Beanstalk components and architecture, and describes important design considerations for your Elastic Beanstalk application\. 

In addition to the Elastic Beanstalk console, you can use the following tools to create and manage Elastic Beanstalk environments\.

## EB CLI<a name="GettingStarted.UsingAEB.cli"></a>

The EB CLI is a command line tool for creating and managing environments\. See [Using the Elastic Beanstalk command line interface \(EB CLI\)](eb-cli3.md) for details\.

## AWS SDK for Java<a name="GettingStarted.UsingAEB.JavaSDK"></a>

 The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API you can use to build applications that use AWS infrastructure services\. With the AWS SDK for Java, you can get started in minutes with a single, downloadable package that includes the AWS Java library, code examples, and documentation\.

 The AWS SDK for Java requires the J2SE Development Kit 5\.0 or later\. You can download the latest Java software from [http://developers.sun.com/downloads/](http://developers.sun.com/downloads/)\. The SDK also requires Apache Commons \(Codec, HTTPClient, and Logging\) and Saxon\-HE third\-party packages, which are included in the third\-party directory of the SDK\. 

 For more information, see [AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/)\.

## AWS Toolkit for Eclipse<a name="GettingStarted.UsingAEB.eclipse"></a>

The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse is an open source plug\-in for the Eclipse Java IDE\. You can use it to create AWS Java web projects that are preconfigured with the AWS SDK for Java, and then deploy the web applications to Elastic Beanstalk\. The Elastic Beanstalk plug\-in builds on top of the Eclipse Web Tools Platform \(WTP\)\. The toolkit provides a Travel Log sample web application template that demonstrates the use of Amazon S3 and Amazon SNS\. 

To ensure that you have all the WTP dependencies, we recommend that you start with the Java EE distribution of Eclipse\. You can download it from [http://eclipse\.org/downloads/](http://eclipse.org/downloads/)\. 

For more information about using the Elastic Beanstalk plug\-in for Eclipse, see [AWS Toolkit for Eclipse](https://aws.amazon.com/eclipse/)\. To get started creating your Elastic Beanstalk application using Eclipse, see [Creating and deploying Java applications on Elastic Beanstalk](create_deploy_Java.md)\.

## AWS SDK for \.NET<a name="GettingStarted.UsingAEB.NETSDK"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET enables you to build applications that use AWS infrastructure services\. With the AWS SDK for \.NET, you can get started in minutes with a single, downloadable package that includes the AWS \.NET library, code examples, and documentation\. 

For more information, see [AWS SDK for \.NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/)\. For supported \.NET Framework and Visual Studio versions, see the [AWS SDK for \.NET Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/)\.

## AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio<a name="GettingStarted.UsingAEB.vs"></a>

With the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio plug\-in, you can deploy an existing \.NET application to Elastic Beanstalk\. You can also create projects using the AWS templates that are preconfigured with the AWS SDK for \.NET\. 

For prerequisite and installation information, see the [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/)\. To get started creating your Elastic Beanstalk application using Visual Studio, see [Creating and deploying \.NET applications on Elastic Beanstalk](create_deploy_NET.md)\.

## AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node\.js<a name="GettingStarted.UsingAEB.NodejsSDK"></a>

The AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node\.js enables you to build applications on top of AWS infrastructure services\. With the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node\.js, you can get started in minutes with a single, downloadable package that includes the AWS Node\.js library, code examples, and documentation\. 

For more information, see the [AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node\.js](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/)\. 

## AWS SDK for PHP<a name="GettingStarted.UsingAEB.PHPSDK"></a>

The AWS SDK for PHP enables you to build applications on top of AWS infrastructure services\. With the AWS SDK for PHP, you can get started in minutes with a single, downloadable package that includes the AWS PHP library, code examples, and documentation\. 

The AWS SDK for PHP requires PHP 5\.2 or later\. For download details, see [http://php.net/](http://php.net/)\.

For more information, see the [AWS SDK for PHP](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/)\. 

## AWS SDK for Python \(Boto\)<a name="GettingStarted.UsingAEB.PythonSDK"></a>

With the AWS SDK for Python \(Boto\), you can get started in minutes with a single, downloadable package that includes the AWS Python library, code examples, and documentation\. You can build Python applications on top of APIs that take the complexity out of coding directly against web service interfaces\. 

The all\-in\-one library provides Python developer\-friendly APIs that hide many of the lower\-level tasks associated with programming for the AWS Cloud, including authentication, request retries, and error handling\. The SDK provides practical examples in Python for how to use the libraries to build applications\. 

For information about Boto, example code, documentation, tools, and additional resources, see the [Python Developer Center](https://aws.amazon.com/python/)\. 

## AWS SDK for Ruby<a name="GettingStarted.UsingAEB.RubySDK"></a>

You can get started in minutes with a single, downloadable package complete with the AWS Ruby library, code examples, and documentation\. You can build Ruby applications on top of APIs that take the complexity out of coding directly against web services interfaces\. 

The all\-in\-one library provides Ruby developer\-friendly APIs that hide many of the lower\-level tasks associated with programming for the AWS Cloud, including authentication, request retries, and error handling\. The SDK provides practical examples in Ruby for how to use the libraries to build applications\.
