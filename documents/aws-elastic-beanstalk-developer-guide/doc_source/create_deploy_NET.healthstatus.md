# Monitoring application health<a name="create_deploy_NET.healthstatus"></a>

When you are running a production website, it is important to know that your application is available and responding to requests\. To assist with monitoring your applicationâ€™s responsiveness, Elastic Beanstalk provides features where you can monitor statistics about your application and create alerts that trigger when thresholds are exceeded\.

For information about the health monitoring provided by Elastic Beanstalk, see [Basic health reporting](using-features.healthstatus.md)\.

You can access operational information about your application by using either the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio or the AWS Management Console\.

The toolkit displays your environment's status and application health in the **Status** field\.
