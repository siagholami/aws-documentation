Install Python, pip, and the EB CLI on Windows
The Python Software Foundation provides installers for Windows that include pip.
To install Python 3.7 and pip (Windows)


Download the Python 3.7 Windows x86-64 executable installer from the downloads page of Python.org.


Run the installer.


Choose Add Python 3.7 to PATH.


Choose Install Now.


The installer installs Python in your user folder and adds its executable directories to your user path.
To install the AWS CLI with pip (Windows)


From the Start menu, open a Command Prompt window.


Verify that Python and pip are both installed correctly by using the following commands.


C:\Windows\System32> python --version
   Python 3.7.3
   C:\Windows\System32> pip --version
   pip 9.0.1 from c:\users\myname\appdata\local\programs\python\python37\lib\site-packages (python 3.7)

Install the EB CLI using pip.

C:\Windows\System32> pip install awsebcli --upgrade --user

Add the executable path, %USERPROFILE%\AppData\roaming\Python\Python37\scripts, to your PATH environment variable. The location might be different, depending on whether you install Python for one user or all users.

To modify your PATH variable (Windows):


Press the Windows key, and then enter environment variables.


Choose Edit environment variables for your account.


Choose PATH, and then choose Edit.


Add paths to the Variable value field, separated by semicolons. For example: C:\item1\path;C:\item2\path


Choose OK twice to apply the new settings.


Close any running Command Prompt windows, and then reopen a Command Prompt window.


Restart a new command shell for the new PATH variable to take effect. 


Verify that the EB CLI is installed correctly.
