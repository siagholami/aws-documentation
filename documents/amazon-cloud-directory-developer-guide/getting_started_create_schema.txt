Create a Schema
Amazon Cloud Directory supports uploading of a compliant JSON file for schema creation. To create a new schema, you can either create your own JSON file from scratch or download one of the existing schemas listed in the console. Then upload it as a custom schema. For more information, see Custom Schemas.
You can also create, delete, download, list, publish, update and upgrade schemas using the Cloud Directory APIs. For more information about schema API operations, see the Amazon Cloud Directory API Reference Guide.
Choose either of the procedures below, depending on your preferred method.
