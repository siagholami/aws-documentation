Getting Started
In this getting started exercise, you create a schema. You then choose to create a directory from that same schema or from any of the sample schemas that are available in the AWS Directory Service console. Although not required, we recommend that you review Understanding Key Cloud Directory Concepts before you begin using the console so that you are familiar with the core features and terminology.
