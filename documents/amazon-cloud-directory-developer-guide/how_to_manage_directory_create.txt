Create Your Directory
Before you can create a directory in Amazon Cloud Directory, AWS Directory Service requires that you first apply a schema to it. A directory cannot be created without a schema and typically has one schema applied to it. However, you use Cloud Directory API operations to apply additional schemas to a directory. For more information, see ApplySchema in the Amazon Cloud Directory API Reference Guide.
To create a Cloud Directory


In the AWS Directory Service console navigation pane, under Cloud Directory, choose Directories.


Choose Set up Cloud Directory.


Under Choose a schema to apply to your new directory, type the friendly name of your directory, such as User Repository, and then choose one of the following options:
    Managed schema
    Sample schema
    Custom schema


Sample schemas and custom schemas are placed in the Development state, by default. For more information about schema states, see Schema Lifecycle. Before a schema can be applied to a directory, it must be converted into the Published state. To successfully publish a sample schema using the console, you must have permissions to the following actions:
     clouddirectory:Get*
     clouddirectory:List*
     clouddirectory:CreateSchema
     clouddirectory:CreateDirectory
     clouddirectory:PutSchemaFromJson
     clouddirectory:PublishSchema
     clouddirectory:DeleteSchema
Since sample schemas are read-only templates provided by AWS, they cannot be published directly. Instead, when you choose to create a directory based on a sample schema, the console creates a temporary copy of the sample schema you selected and places it in the Development state. It then creates a copy of that development schema and places it in the Published state. Once published, the development schema is deleted, which is why the DeleteSchema action is necessary when publishing a sample schema.


Choose Next.


Review the directory information and make any necessary changes. When the information is correct, choose Create.
