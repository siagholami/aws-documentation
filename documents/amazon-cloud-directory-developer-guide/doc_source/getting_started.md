# Getting Started<a name="getting_started"></a>

In this getting started exercise, you create a schema\. You then choose to create a directory from that same schema or from any of the sample schemas that are available in the AWS Directory Service console\. Although not required, we recommend that you review [Understanding Key Cloud Directory Concepts](key_concepts.md) before you begin using the console so that you are familiar with the core features and terminology\.
