## Shared Responsibility<a name="compliance_sharedresponsibility"></a>

Security, including HIPAA and PCI compliance, is a [shared responsibility](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)\. It is important to understand that Cloud Directory compliance status does not automatically apply to applications that you run in the AWS Cloud\. You must ensure that your use of AWS services complies with the standards\.
