# Logging and Monitoring in Amazon Cloud Directory<a name="incident-response"></a>

As a best practice, you should monitor your directory to ensure that changes are logged\. This helps you to ensure that any unexpected change can be investigated and unwanted changes can be rolled back\. Amazon Cloud Directory currently supports AWS CloudTrail, which you can use to monitor your directory and any associated activity\.

For more information, see [Logging Cloud Directory API Calls with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clouddirectory/latest/APIReference/cloudtrail_logging.html)\.
