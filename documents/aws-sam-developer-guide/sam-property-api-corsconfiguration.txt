CorsConfiguration
Manage cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for your API Gateway APIs. Specify the domain to allow as a string or specify a dictionary with additional Cors configuration. NOTE: Cors requires SAM to modify your OpenAPI definition, so it only works with inline OpenApi defined in the DefinitionBody property.
For more information about CORS, see Enable CORS for an API Gateway REST API Resource in the Amazon API Gateway Developer Guide.
Note: If CorsConfiguration is set both in OpenAPI and at the property level, AWS SAM merges them, with the properties taking precedence.
