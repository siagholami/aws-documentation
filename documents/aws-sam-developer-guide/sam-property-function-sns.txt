SNS
The object describing an SNS event source type.
SAM generates AWS::SNS::Subscription resource when this event type is set
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template, use the following syntax.
YAML
[FilterPolicy](#sam-function-sns-filterpolicy): [SnsFilterPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-sns-subscription.html#cfn-sns-subscription-filterpolicy)
  [Region](#sam-function-sns-region): String
  [SqsSubscription](#sam-function-sns-sqssubscription): Boolean | SqsSubscriptionObject
  [Topic](#sam-function-sns-topic): String
Properties
FilterPolicy 
The filter policy JSON assigned to the subscription. For more information, see GetSubscriptionAttributes in the Amazon Simple Notification Service API Reference.
Type: SnsFilterPolicy
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is passed directly to the [FilterPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-sns-subscription.html#cfn-sns-subscription-filterpolicy) property of an AWS::SNS::Subscription resource.
Region 
For cross-region subscriptions, the region in which the topic resides.
If no region is specified, CloudFormation uses the region of the caller as the default.
Type: String
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is passed directly to the [Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-sns-subscription.html#cfn-sns-subscription-region) property of an AWS::SNS::Subscription resource.
SqsSubscription 
Set this property to true, or specify SqsSubscriptionObject to enable batching SNS topic notifications in an SQS queue. Setting this property to true creates a new SQS queue, whereas specifying a SqsSubscriptionObject uses an existing SQS queue.
Type: Boolean | SqsSubscriptionObject
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
Topic 
The ARN of the topic to subscribe to.
Type: String
Required: Yes
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is passed directly to the [TopicArn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-sns-subscription.html#topicarn) property of an AWS::SNS::Topic resource.
