HttpApiCorsConfiguration
Manage cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for your HTTP APIs. Specify the domain to allow as a string or specify a dictionary with additional Cors configuration. NOTE: Cors requires SAM to modify your OpenAPI definition, so it only works with inline OpenApi defined in the DefinitionBody property.
For more information about CORS, see Configuring CORS for an HTTP API in the Amazon API Gateway Developer Guide.
Note: If HttpApiCorsConfiguration is set both in OpenAPI and at the property level, AWS SAM merges them with the properties taking precedence.
