AWS SAM Policy Templates
AWS SAM allows you to choose from a list of policy templates to scope the permissions of your Lambda functions to the resources that are used by your application.
AWS SAM applications in the AWS Serverless Application Repository that use policy templates don't require any special customer acknowledgments to deploy the application from the AWS Serverless Application Repository.
If you want to request a new policy template to be added, do the following:


Submit a pull request against the policy_templates.json source file in the develop branch of the AWS SAM GitHub project. You can find the source file in policy_templates.json on the GitHub website.


Submit an issue in the AWS SAM GitHub project that includes the reasons for your pull request and a link to the request. Use this link to submit a new issue: AWS Serverless Application Model: Issues.


Syntax
For every policy template you specify in your AWS SAM template file, you must always specify an object containing the policy template's placeholder values. If a policy template does not require any placeholder values, you must specify an empty object.
YAML
MyFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    Policies:
      - PolicyTemplateName1:        # Policy template with placeholder value
          Key1: Value1
      - PolicyTemplateName2: {}     # Policy template with no placeholder value
Examples
Example 1: Policy Template with Placeholder Values
The following example shows that the SQSPollerPolicy policy template expects a QueueName as a resource. The AWS SAM template retrieves the name of the "MyQueue" Amazon SQS queue, which you can create in the same application or requested as a parameter to the application.
1. MyFunction:
 2.   Type: 'AWS::Serverless::Function'
 3.   Properties:
 4.     CodeUri: ${codeuri}
 5.     Handler: hello.handler
 6.     Runtime: python2.7
 7.     Policies:
 8.       - SQSPollerPolicy:
 9.           QueueName:
10.             !GetAtt MyQueue.QueueName
Example 2: Policy Template with No Placeholder Values
The following example contains the CloudWatchPutMetricPolicy policy template, which has no placeholder values.
Note
Even though there are no placeholder values, you must specify an empty object, otherwise an error will result.
1. MyFunction:
2.   Type: 'AWS::Serverless::Function'
3.   Properties:
4.     CodeUri: ${codeuri}
5.     Handler: hello.handler
6.     Runtime: python2.7
7.     Policies:
8.       - CloudWatchPutMetricPolicy: {}

Troubleshooting
SAM CLI error: "Must specify valid parameter values for policy template ''"
When executing sam build, you see the following error:
"Must specify valid parameter values for policy template '<policy-template-name>'"
This means that you did not pass an empty object when declaring a policy template that does not have any placeholder values.
To fix this, declare the policy like the following example for CloudWatchPutMetricPolicy.
1. MyFunction:
2.   Policies:
3.     - CloudWatchPutMetricPolicy: {}
