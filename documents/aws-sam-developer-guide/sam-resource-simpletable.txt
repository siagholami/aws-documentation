AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable
Creates a DynamoDB table with a single attribute primary key. It is useful when data only needs to be accessed via a primary key.
To use the more advanced functionality of DynamoDB, use an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-dynamodb-table.html resource instead.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template, use the following syntax.
YAML
Type: AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable
Properties:
  [PrimaryKey](#sam-simpletable-primarykey): PrimaryKeyObject
  [ProvisionedThroughput](#sam-simpletable-provisionedthroughput): [ProvisionedThroughput](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-dynamodb-provisionedthroughput.html)
  [SSESpecification](#sam-simpletable-ssespecification): [SSESpecification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-dynamodb-table-ssespecification.html)
  [TableName](#sam-simpletable-tablename): String
  [Tags](#sam-simpletable-tags): Map
Properties
PrimaryKey 
Attribute name and type to be used as the table's primary key. If not provided, the primary key will be a String with a value of id.
Note: The value of this property cannot be modified after this resource is created.
Type: PrimaryKeyObject
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
ProvisionedThroughput 
Read and write throughput provisioning information.
If ProvisionedThroughput is not specified BillingMode will be specified as PAY_PER_REQUEST.
Type: ProvisionedThroughput
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is passed directly to the [ProvisionedThroughput](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-dynamodb-provisionedthroughput.html) property of an AWS::DynamoDB::Table resource.
SSESpecification 
Specifies the settings to enable server-side encryption.
Type: SSESpecification
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is passed directly to the [SSESpecification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-dynamodb-table-ssespecification.html) property of an AWS::DynamoDB::Table resource.
TableName 
Name for the DynamoDB Table.
Type: String
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is passed directly to the [TableName](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-dynamodb-table.html#cfn-dynamodb-table-tablename) property of an AWS::DynamoDB::Table resource.
Tags 
A map (string to string) that specifies the tags to be added to this SimpleTable. Keys and values are limited to alphanumeric characters. Keys can be 1 to 127 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:. Values can be 1 to 255 Unicode characters in length.
Type: Map
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is similar to the [Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-dynamodb-table.html#cfn-dynamodb-table-tags) property of an AWS::DynamoDB::Table resource. The Tags property in SAM consists of Key:Value pairs; in CloudFormation it consists of a list of Tag objects.
Return Values
Ref
When the logical ID of this resource is provided to the Ref intrinsic function, it returns the resource name of the underlying DynamoDB table.
For more information about using the Ref function, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-ref.html in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
