S3
The object describing an S3 event source type.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template, use the following syntax.
YAML
[Bucket](#sam-function-s3-bucket): String
  [Events](#sam-function-s3-events): String | List
  [Filter](#sam-function-s3-filter): [NotificationFilter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-notificationconfiguration-config-filter.html)
Properties
Bucket 
S3 bucket name. This bucket must exist in the same template.
Type: String
Required: Yes
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is similar to the [BucketName](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket.html#cfn-s3-bucket-name) property of an AWS::S3::Bucket resource. This is a required field in SAM. This field only accepts a reference to the S3 bucket created in this template
Events 
The Amazon S3 bucket event for which to invoke the AWS Lambda function. See Amazon S3 supported event types for a list of valid values.
Type: String | List
Required: Yes
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is passed directly to the [Event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-notificationconfig-lambdaconfig.html#cfn-s3-bucket-notificationconfig-lambdaconfig-event) property of the AWS::S3::Bucket LambdaConfiguration data type.
Filter 
The filtering rules that determine which Amazon S3 objects invoke the Lambda function. For information about Amazon S3 key name filtering, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
Type: NotificationFilter
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is passed directly to the [Filter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-notificationconfiguration-config-filter.html) property of the AWS::S3::Bucket LambdaConfiguration data type.
