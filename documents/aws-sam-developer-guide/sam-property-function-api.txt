Api
The object describing an Api event source type. If an AWS::Serverless::Api resource is defined, the path and method values must correspond to an operation in the OpenAPI definition of the API.
If no AWS::Serverless::Api is defined, the function input and output are a representation of the HTTP request and HTTP response.
For example, using the JavaScript API, the status code and body of the response can be controlled by returning an object with the keys statusCode and body.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template, use the following syntax.
YAML
[Auth](#sam-function-api-auth): ApiFunctionAuth
  [Method](#sam-function-api-method): String
  [Path](#sam-function-api-path): String
  [RequestModel](#sam-function-api-requestmodel): RequestModel
  [RequestParameters](#sam-function-api-requestparameters): String | RequestParameter
  [RestApiId](#sam-function-api-restapiid): String
Properties
Auth 
Auth configuration for this specific ApiPathMethod.
Useful for overriding the API's DefaultAuthorizer setting auth config on an individual path when no DefaultAuthorizer is specified or overriding the default ApiKeyRequired setting.
Type: ApiFunctionAuth
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
Method 
HTTP method for which this function is invoked.
Type: String
Required: Yes
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
Path 
Uri path for which this function is invoked. Must start with /.
Type: String
Required: Yes
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
RequestModel 
Request model to use for this specific ApiPathMethod. This should reference the name of a model specified in the Models section of an AWS::Serverless::Api resource.
Type: RequestModel
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
RequestParameters 
Request parameters configuration for this specific ApiPathMethod. All parameter names must start with method.request and must be limited to method.request.header, method.request.querystring, or method.request.path.
If a parameter is a string and not a Function Request Parameter Object, then Required and Caching will default to False.
Type: String | RequestParameter
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
RestApiId 
Identifier of a RestApi resource, which must contain an operation with the given path and method. Typically, this is set to reference an AWS::Serverless::Api resource defined in this template.
If you don't define this property, AWS SAM creates a default AWS::Serverless::Api resource using a generated OpenApi document. That resource contains a union of all paths and methods defined by Api events in the same template that do not specify a RestApiId.
This cannot reference an AWS::Serverless::Api resource defined in another template.
Type: String
Required: No
AWS CloudFormation compatibility: This property is unique to AWS SAM and doesn't have an AWS CloudFormation equivalent.
