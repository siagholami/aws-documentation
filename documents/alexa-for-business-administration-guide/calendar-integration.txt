Calendar Integration
You can connect Alexa for Business to your calendar system, This allows users to join scheduled meetings without knowing the dial-in details. When Alexa for Business is connected to your calendar system and a user asks Alexa to join a meeting, Alexa for Business reads the meeting on the associated room calendar and gets the dial-in information. 
Alexa for Business can get meeting dial-in information from the following conference providers:
 Amazon Chime
 BlueJeans
 Zoom
 RingCentral Meetings
 Skype for Business
 Fuze
 Cisco WebEx
Note
Cisco WebEx meeting invites that include TSP audio bridge are currently not supported.
 Google Hangouts Meet
Note
Google Hangouts Meet is only supported on shared devices.
If there are issues with one of the conference providers, send an email to a4b-conferencing@amazon.com and include an example of your meeting invite. 
Note
Connecting Alexa for Business to your calendar system is required only when your third-party Alexa skill doesnâ€™t natively support joining scheduled meetings.
