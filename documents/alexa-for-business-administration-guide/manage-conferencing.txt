Managing Conferencing and Room Booking
After the calendaring system in Alexa for Business is linked, users can ask Alexa to control existing video conferencing equipment with their voice. They can also use Alexa to find and reserve available meeting rooms in the office. If the room isn't available, Alexa can tell them who made the reservation.
