Link Alexa for Business to Office 365
There are two methods to link Alexa for Business to your Office 365 account. 
Use Method 1 to link your Office 365 account by using a service account that has permissions to read and write to your room calendars. This method provides you with more control over the calendar resources that Alexa for Business can access. 
Use Method 2 to use application permissions and set up the calendar only once. Then you won't need to update permissions when you add Alexa to more rooms. You must sign in as a global administrator user to link your Office 365 account to Alexa for Business.
Method 1: Link with Delegate Permissions (Recommended)
To link with delegate permissions


Create a service account for Alexa for Business in your Office 365 tenant:


Sign into Office 365 as an administrator.


Add a user in your Office 365 account that will use a service account. For more information, see Add users individually or in bulk to Office 365.
For example, if your domain is "mycompany.com" and you add a user with the user name of "alexaforbusiness," the email address is "alexaforbusiness@mycompany.com".


Open PowerShell and connect to Exchange Online. For more information, see Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. 


Run the following PowerShell command to create a service account with access to the calendars in your organization:


New-Mailbox -UserPrincipalName alexaforbusiness@your_domain -Alias “AlexaforBusiness” -Name alexaforbusiness -f Users -FirstName Alexa -LastName “Service Account” -DisplayName "Alexa for Business Service Account"
Note
Make sure that "your_domain" is the domain of your organization, and enter your password when prompted.

To look up meeting dial-in information from your resource mailboxes, configure them to include descriptions. Run one of the following commands to keep the descriptions in the meeting invites of your resource mailboxes:

For a single room mailbox:
Set-CalendarProcessing “<room name>” -DeleteComments $FALSE 
For all room mailboxes:
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -RecipientTypeDetails “RoomMailbox” | Set-CalendarProcessing -DeleteComments $FALSE

Run one of the following commands to give the service account permissions to access the room calendars in your organization:

For a single room mailbox:
Add-MailboxFolderPermission <room name>:\Calendar -User alexaforbusiness -AccessRights Editor 
For all room mailboxes:
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -RecipientTypeDetails “RoomMailbox” | ForEach-Object {Add-MailboxFolderPermission $_":\calendar" -user alexaforbusiness -AccessRights Editor}
