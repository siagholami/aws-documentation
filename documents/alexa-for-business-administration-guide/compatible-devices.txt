When the room doesnâ€™t contain any of the supported video conferencing or in-room control systems, you can use the Echo device as a speaker phone to dial into meetings. In this case, the Echo device uses Alexa Calling and Messaging, and makes a PSTN call to the phone number specified in your conference provider settings. Currently, the Echo device can call phone numbers in the US, Canada, and Mexico.
The following diagram shows how Alexa for Business controls your conference devices.
