When the room doesn’t contain any of the supported video conferencing or in\-room control systems, you can use the Echo device as a speaker phone to dial into meetings\. In this case, the Echo device uses Alexa Calling and Messaging, and makes a PSTN call to the phone number specified in your conference provider settings\. Currently, the Echo device can call phone numbers in the US, Canada, and Mexico\.
