# Managing Calling<a name="manage-calling"></a>

You can make calls from your shared devices with Alexa for Business\. You can either call a contact that you defined in the Alexa for Business console by saying the name out loud, or call a number by saying the number out loud\. For example, you can say “Alexa, call helpdesk” or “Alexa, call 206\-555\-0126\.”

**Note**  
The following types of calls are currently not supported:  
Emergency services numbers \(for example, “911”\)
Premium\-rate numbers \(for example, “1\-900” numbers or toll numbers\)
N\-1\-1 numbers or abbreviated dial codes \(for example, “211” or “411”\)
International numbers \(numbers outside of the US, Canada, or Mexico\)
Dial\-by\-letter numbers \(for example, “1\-800\-FLOWERS”\)
