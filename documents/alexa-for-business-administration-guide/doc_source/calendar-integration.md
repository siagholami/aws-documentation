# Calendar Integration<a name="calendar-integration"></a>

You can connect Alexa for Business to your calendar system, This allows users to join scheduled meetings without knowing the dial\-in details\. When Alexa for Business is connected to your calendar system and a user asks Alexa to join a meeting, Alexa for Business reads the meeting on the associated room calendar and gets the dial\-in information\. 

Alexa for Business can get meeting dial\-in information from the following conference providers:
+ Amazon Chime
+ BlueJeans
+ Zoom
+ RingCentral Meetings
+ Skype for Business
+ Fuze
+ Cisco WebEx
**Note**  
Cisco WebEx meeting invites that include TSP audio bridge are currently not supported\.
+ Google Hangouts Meet
**Note**  
Google Hangouts Meet is only supported on shared devices\.

If there are issues with one of the conference providers, send an email to **a4b\-conferencing@amazon\.com** and include an example of your meeting invite\. 

**Note**  
Connecting Alexa for Business to your calendar system is required only when your third\-party Alexa skill doesn’t natively support joining scheduled meetings\.
