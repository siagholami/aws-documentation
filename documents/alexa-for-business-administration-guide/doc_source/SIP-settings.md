# SIP/H323 Settings<a name="SIP-settings"></a>

When you use Alexa to control your existing conference devices, such as Cisco Telepresence, you must specify the SIP or H323 endpoint that gets called when you ask Alexa to join a meeting\.

Alexa for Business uses these endpoints, and the meeting ID and PIN from the scheduled meeting to create a dial string\. This dial string is sent to the Alexa skill you enabled to control your conference device\. 

**Note**  
SIP/H323 settings are used only when using Alexa to control third\-party conference devices\. They aren't used when using an Echo device as a speaker phone\.
