# PSTN Settings<a name="PSTN-settings"></a>

When you use your Echo device as a speaker phone to dial into meetings, you must configure the PSTN settings\. Alexa for Business uses PSTN settings,and the meeting ID and PIN from the scheduled meeting, to create a dial sequence\.

Alexa for Business uses this dial sequence to join the audio conference in the background and send the meeting ID and PIN as dual\-tone multi\-frequency signaling \(DTMF\) tones\. The specified delays provide pauses before Alexa for Business enters the information\. For example, there is a wait, the welcome announcement completes, and the user can enter the meeting ID\.
