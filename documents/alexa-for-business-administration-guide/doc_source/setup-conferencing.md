# Understanding Alexa\-enabled Conferencing<a name="setup-conferencing"></a>

Alexa for Business lets you bring Alexa to your meeting rooms\. Use Alexa to start meetings and control your conference room systems by using your voice\. You can say things like “Alexa, join my meeting” and Alexa prompts you to join the scheduled meeting on the calendar\. If there is no scheduled meeting or you want to join a different meeting, say your meeting ID and, if required, the PIN\.

You can use Alexa for Business to control the conference device in your meeting room\. First, enable and set up the Alexa skill for your compatible conference devices, then set up your conferencing provider, and finally, you can link a calendar system\.
