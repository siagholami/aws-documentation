# Managing Skill Groups<a name="manage-skill-groups"></a>

Skill groups are collections of skills that Alexa for Business uses to enable skills on the Alexa devices in your rooms\. For example, you can define a skill group with all the skills for your conference rooms\. When you assign an Alexa device to a room, Alexa for Business enables the skills in the skill groups assigned to the room\.

You can add skills to your skill groups at any time, and Alexa for Business automatically enables them on the Alexa devices\. To enable skills for a device in a room, you must first add them to a skill group, then assign that skill group to a room or group of rooms\.

You can also remove a skill group from one or more rooms, or delete it\.
