Any member of an Alexa for Business organization can publish private business skills to your organization within minutes using Alexa for Business Blueprints\. After a user builds a blueprint, you can review and publish the skill to use across your company with any Alexa\-enabled device\. There are two blueprints designed specifically for business use\. The **Business Q&A** blueprint is a template that users can customize with their own questions and answers related to your organization\. The **Onboard Guide** blueprint helps new employees get up to speed in their new roles with specialized how\-to questions about the team and the office\.
