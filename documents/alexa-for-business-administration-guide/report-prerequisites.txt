Usage Report Prerequisites
Before you can export your usage reports to S3, complete the following steps.
To prepare for report creation


If you don't have one already, create an S3 bucket. 


Open the S3 console and create an S3 bucket.


Enter a bucket name. (For example, my-s3-bucket-name.)


Set the S3 bucket policy.


Select the S3 bucket you created, choose Permissions, and then choose Bucket Policy.


In the Bucket policy editor, copy and paste the following S3 bucket policy. Replace "" with your bucket name, and choose Save.

                      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::994698236012:root"
                  },
                  "Action": [
                      "s3:PutObject",
                      "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                      "s3:GetBucketAcl"
                  ],
                  "Resource": [
                      "arn:aws:s3:::<my-s3-bucket-name>",
                      "arn:aws:s3:::<my-s3-bucket-name>/*"
                  ]
              }
          ]
      }


Verify that you have permissions to write to the S3 bucket location. Also make sure that the AWS IAM user, which you logged into the Alexa for Business console with, has the same permissions. 
Note
If your IAM user can't write to the S3 bucket, you can't configure it as an export location.
