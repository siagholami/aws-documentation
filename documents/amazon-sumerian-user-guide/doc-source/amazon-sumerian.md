# What Is Amazon Sumerian?<a name="amazon-sumerian"></a>

Amazon Sumerian is a set of tools for creating high\-quality virtual reality \(VR\) experiences on the web\. With Sumerian, you can construct an interactive 3D scene without any programming experience, test it in the browser, and publish it as a website that is immediately available to users\.

Use the Sumerian library of assets or bring your own\. When you import 3D models, Sumerian converts and optimizes them automatically\. Sumerian also has a library of primitive shapes, 3D models, hosts, textures, and scripts\.

**Note**  
New to 3D, VR, animation, and scripting? The [Sumerian website](https://docs.sumerian.amazonaws.com/) has a ton of helpful tutorials for every level of experience\.

The Sumerian 3D engine provides a library for advanced scripting with JavaScript, but you don't have to be a programmer to create interactive VR\! Use the built\-in state machine to animate objects and respond to user actions like clicks and movement\.

When you're ready to share your work with the world, you can publish it directly to Amazon CloudFront as a static website that can be viewed with a [WebVR](https://webvr.info/)\-compatible browser and headset\.
