# Amazon Sumerian Tutorials and Samples<a name="sumerian-gettingstarted"></a>

You can start working with the Sumerian editor quickly with just a web browser\. You don't need to download any additional software or connect a virtual reality \(VR\) headset to make interactive scenes and learn about Sumerian features\.

To get familiar with the Sumerian editor, build a scene by using the [getting started tutorial](gettingstarted-tutorial.md)\. The tutorial introduces entity management, cameras, configuration, and state machines\.

Next, learn about working with external assets by downloading and importing a [sample character model](gettingstarted-robin.md)\. You can create models with free tools and import them into your Sumerian scene, converting them to Sumerian assets with texture and animation data intact\.

Do more with cameras and state machines by recreating the [model showcase scene](gettingstarted-showcase.md)\. Learn how to configure a camera script and use a state machine to trigger animations in response to user input\.
