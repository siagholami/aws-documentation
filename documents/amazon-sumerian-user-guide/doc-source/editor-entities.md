# Using the Entities Panel in the Amazon Sumerian Editor<a name="editor-entities"></a>

The entities panel shows you a scene's entities in a hierarchy, starting with the scene itself\. An entity can be a child of the scene or of another entity\. When you choose the scene in the entities panel, the [inspector panel](editor-inspector.md) shows the scene's settings\. When you choose an entity, the inspector panel shows the entity's components\.

Organize your entities by their physical or logical relationship to other entities\. An entity's position, rotation, and scale are relative to its parent\. When you move the parent, the child moves as well\. To change an entity's parent, drag it onto the new parent in the entities panel\.
