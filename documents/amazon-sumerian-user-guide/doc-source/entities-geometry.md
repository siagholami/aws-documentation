# Amazon Sumerian Geometry Component<a name="entities-geometry"></a>

The geometry component contains a renderable mesh or primitive on the entity\. When you import a 3D model, or create a primitive from the **Create entity** menu, it always gets a geometry component\.

Together with a material component, you can render the entity\. If you don't have a material component, the geometry is invisible\.

The panel looks different for different kinds of meshes and primitives, but in general, they have these settings:

**Properties**
+ Cast shadows
+ Receive shadows
+ Dimensions and/or number of samples \(primitives only\)
