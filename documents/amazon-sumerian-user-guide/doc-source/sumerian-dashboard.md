# The Amazon Sumerian Dashboard<a name="sumerian-dashboard"></a>

The Dashboard is the first thing you see when you open the Amazon Sumerian app\. This is where you manage your projects, scenes, asset packs, and templates\.

![\[\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sumerian/latest/userguide/images/dashboard.png)

Projects collect scenes and the templates and asset packs that you export from them\. You can create draft projects outside of a project, but you must have a project to export templates and assets\.

When you open a scene in the editor, it is locked to prevent other users from modifying it\. The dashboard manages locks and lets you steal a lock if the other user leaves a scene open by accident\.
