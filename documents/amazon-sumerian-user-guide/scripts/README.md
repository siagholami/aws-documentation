## Sample Scripts
These scripts use the Amazon Sumerian engine library to create or modify
scene content dynamically during playback.

Some of the scripts define setup functions that run when playback
starts. Attach these to an entity using a script component.

Scripts ending in "-action.js" are state machine script actions
that define enter and exit functions that run when a state is
entered or exited. Attach these to a state machine behavior with
the "execute script" action.
