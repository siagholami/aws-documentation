What Is AWS RoboMaker?
AWS RoboMaker is a service that makes it easy to create robotics applications at scale. AWS RoboMaker extends the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework with cloud services. This includes AWS machine learning services. It includes monitoring services. It even includes analytics services. These combine to enable a robot to do several things on its own. Stream data, navigate, communicate, comprehend, and learn. AWS RoboMaker provides a robotics application development environment. It provides a robotics simulation service, which speeds application testing. It provides a fleet management service so you can deploy and manage applications remotely.
