Creating a Fleet
To create a fleet, follow the steps under one of the following tabs:

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Fleet Management, and then choose fleets.


Select Create fleet.


In the Create fleet page, type a name for the fleet.


Optionally, under Tags, specify one or more tags for the fleet. Tags are words or phrases that act as metadata for identifying and organizing your AWS resources. Each tag consists of a key and a value. You can manage tags for your fleet on the Fleet details page.


For more about tagging, see Tagging Your AWS RoboMaker Resources. 

Click Create to create the deployment job. 


[ Using the AWS CLI ]
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based fleet creation on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker create-fleet --name my-fleet
