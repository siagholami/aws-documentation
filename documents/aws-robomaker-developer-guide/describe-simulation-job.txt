Viewing a Simulation Job
You can view information about a simulation job and, if the job is running, launch Gazebo, rviz, rqt, or a terminal to interact with the simulation. You can also view details about the simulation job and manage tags.
To see the details of a simulation job
Follow the steps under one of the following tabs:

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Simulations, then choose Simulation jobs.


Select the Id of a simulation job to view its details including the time it was created and launch commands for the robot application and simulation application.



[ Using the AWS CLI ]
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based view simulation job on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker list-simulation-jobs
$ aws robomaker describe-simulation-job --job my-simulation-job-arn
