Deleting a Fleet
When you no longer need a fleet, you can delete it. When you do this, robots registered to the fleet are deregistered. 
To delete a fleet
Follow these steps under one of the following tabs:

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Fleet Management, and then choose Fleets.


Select the fleet you want to delete, then select Delete.



[ Using the AWS CLI ]
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based fleet deletion on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker delete-fleet --fleet my-fleet-arn
