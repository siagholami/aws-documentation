Deleting a Simulation Application
When you no longer need a AWS RoboMaker simulation application and all of its versions, delete it.
To delete a simulation application
Follow the steps under one of the following tabs.

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Development, then choose Simulation applications.


Select the Name of a simulation application. This shows details such as the time it was created and last updated.


In the simulation application detail page, choose Delete and then choose Delete to delete to confirm.



[ Using the AWS CLI ]
You can use the following commands to delete a simulation application:
 API/SDK: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/latest/dg/API_DeleteSimulationApplication.html
 AWS CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/robomaker/delete-simulation-application.html
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based delete simulation application on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker delete-simulation-application --application my-robot-application-arn
