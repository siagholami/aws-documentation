Authentication and Access Control for AWS RoboMaker
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps an administrator securely control access to AWS RoboMaker resources. Administrators use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use AWS RoboMaker resources. IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no additional charge.

 Troubleshooting Authentication and Access Control
Introduction to Authorization and Access Control
Authentication – To sign in to AWS, you must use IAM user credentials, temporary credentials using IAM roles, or root user credentials (not recommended). To learn more about these entities, see What is Authentication?.
Access Control – AWS administrators use policies to control access to AWS resources, such as the AWS RoboMaker robot application. To learn more, see What is Access Control? and What are Policies?.
Important
All resources in an account are owned by the account, regardless of who created those resources. You must be granted access to create a resource. However, just because you created a resource does not mean that you automatically have full access to that resource. An administrator must explicitly grant permissions for each action that you want to perform. That administrator can also revoke your permissions at any time.
To help you understand the basics of how IAM works, review the following terms:
 Resources – AWS services, such as AWS RoboMaker and IAM, are made up of objects called resources. You can create, manage, and delete these resources from the service. IAM resources include users, groups, roles, and policies. 
   Users – An IAM user represents the person or application who uses its credentials to interact with AWS. A user consists of a name, a password to sign into the AWS Management Console, and up to two access keys that can be used with the AWS CLI or AWS API.
   Groups – An IAM group is a collection of IAM users. You can use groups to specify permissions for its member users. This makes it easier for you to manage permissions for multiple users.
   Roles – An IAM role does not have any long-term credentials (password or access keys) associated with it. A role can be assumed by anyone who needs it and has permissions. An IAM user can assume a role to temporarily take on different permissions for a specific task. Federated users can assume a role by using an external identity provider that is mapped to the role. Some AWS services can assume a service role to access AWS resources on your behalf.
   Policies – Policies are JSON policy documents that define the permissions for the object to which they are attached. AWS supports identity-based policies that you attach to identities (users, groups, or roles). Some AWS services allow you to attach resource-based policies to resources to control what a principal (person or application) can do to that resource. AWS RoboMaker does not support resource-based policies.
 Identities – Identities are IAM resources for which you can define permissions. These include users, groups, and roles.
 Entities – Entities are IAM resources that you use for authentication. These include users and roles. 
 Principals – In AWS, a principal is a person or application that uses an entity to sign in and make requests to AWS. As a principal, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API to perform an operation (such as deleting a robot application). This creates a request for that operation. Your request specifies the action, resource, principal, principal account, and any additional information about your request. All of this information provides AWS with context for your request. AWS checks all the policies that apply to the context of your request. AWS authorizes the request only if each part of your request is allowed by the policies. 
To view a diagram of the authentication and access control process, see Understanding How IAM Works in the IAM User Guide. For details about how AWS determines whether a request is allowed, see Policy Evaluation Logic in the IAM User Guide.
Permissions Required
To use AWS RoboMaker or to manage authorization and access control for yourself or others, you must have the correct permissions. 
Permissions Required to Use the AWS RoboMaker Console
To access the AWS RoboMaker console, you must have a minimum set of permissions that allows you to list and view details about the AWS RoboMaker resources in your AWS account. If you create an identity-based permissions policy that is more restrictive than the minimum required permissions, the console won't function as intended for entities with that policy.
For full access to the AWS RoboMaker console, use the AWSRoboMakerFullAccess policy. 
For read-only access to the AWS RoboMaker console, use the AWSRoboMakerReadOnlyAccess policy.
If an IAM user wants to create a simulation job, you need to grant iam:PassRole permission to that user. For more information about passing a role, see Granting a User Permissions to Pass a Role to an AWS Service. 
For example, you can attach the following policy to a user. It provides permission to create a simulation job:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3AndCloudWatchAccess"
        }
    ]
}
You don't need to allow minimum console permissions for users that are making calls only to the AWS CLI or the AWS API. Instead, you need only the permissions that match the API operation you're trying to perform.
Permissions Required to Use the AWS RoboMaker Simulation Tools
The IAM user or role used to create simulation will automatically have permission to access the simulation tools. If it is a different user or role, it should have the robomaker:CreateSimulationJob privilege. 
Permissions Required for Authentication Management
To manage your own credentials, such as your password, access keys, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices, your administrator must grant you the required permissions. To view the policy that includes these permissions, see Allow Users to Self-Manage Their Credentials.
As an AWS administrator, you need full access to IAM so that you can create and manage users, groups, roles, and policies in IAM. You should use the AdministratorAccess AWS managed policy that includes full access to all of AWS. This policy does not provide access to the AWS Billing and Cost Management console or allow tasks that require root user credentials. For more information, see AWS Tasks That Require AWS Account Root User Credentials in the AWS General Reference.
Warning
Only an administrator user should have full access to AWS. Anyone with this policy has permission to fully manage authentication and access control, in addition to modifying every resource in AWS. To learn how to create this user, see Create your IAM Admin User.
Permissions Required for Access Control
If your administrator provided you with IAM user credentials, they attached policies to your IAM user to control what resources you can access. To view the policies attached to your user in the AWS Management Console, you must have the following permissions:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ViewOwnUserInfo",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetUserPolicy",
                "iam:ListGroupsForUser",
                "iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies",
                "iam:ListUserPolicies",
                "iam:GetUser"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "ListUsersViewGroupsAndPolicies",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetGroupPolicy",
                "iam:GetPolicyVersion",
                "iam:GetPolicy",
                "iam:ListAttachedGroupPolicies",
                "iam:ListGroupPolicies",
                "iam:ListPolicyVersions",
                "iam:ListPolicies",
                "iam:ListUsers"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
If you need additional permissions, ask your administrator to update your policies to allow you to access the actions that you require.
Permissions Required for a Simulation Job
A simulation job, when it is created, must have an IAM role with the permissions below. Replace my-input-bucket with the name of the bucket containing the robot and simulation application bundles. Replace my-output-bucket to point to the bucket were AWS RoboMaker will write output files. Replace account# with your account number.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::my-input-bucket"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::my-input-bucket/*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": "s3:Put*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::my-output-bucket/*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents",
                "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:*:account#:log-group:/aws/robomaker/SimulationJobs*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
The policy must be attached to a role with the following trust policy:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "robomaker.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
Permissions Required to use Tags from a ROS Application or ROS Command Line
You can tag, untag, and list tags in your simulation job from the ROS command-line or in your ROS application while it is running. You must have an IAM role with the permissions below. Replace account# with your account number. 
For more information, see Managing Tags in a Simulation Job
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "robomaker:TagResource",
                "robomaker:UntagResource",
                "robomaker:ListTagsForResource",
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:robomaker:*:account#:simulation-job*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
The policy must be attached to a role with the following trust policy:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "robomaker.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
Understanding How AWS RoboMaker Works with IAM
Services can work with IAM in several ways:
 Actions – AWS RoboMaker supports using actions in a policy. This allows an administrator to control whether an entity can complete an operation in AWS RoboMaker. For example, to allow an entity to view a policy by performing the GetPolicy AWS API operation, an administrator must attach a policy that allows the iam:GetPolicy action. 
 Resource-level permissions – AWS RoboMaker does not support resource-level permissions. Resource-level permissions allow you to use ARNs to specify individual resources in the policy.  Because AWS RoboMaker does not support this feature, then you must choose All resources in the policy visual editor. In a JSON policy document, you must use * in the Resource element. 
 Resource-based policies – AWS RoboMaker does not support resource-based policies. Resource-based policies allow you to attach a policy to a resource within the service. Resource-based policies include a Principal element to specify which IAM identities can access that resource. 
 Authorization based on tags – AWS RoboMaker does support authorization based tags. This feature allows you to use resource tags in the condition of a policy. 
 Temporary credentials – AWS RoboMaker supports temporary credentials. This feature allows you to sign in with federation, assume an IAM role, or to assume a cross-account role. You obtain temporary security credentials by calling AWS STS API operations such as AssumeRole or GetFederationToken. 
 Service-linked roles – AWS RoboMaker supports service roles. This feature allows a service to assume a service-linked role on your behalf. This role allows the service to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account, and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.
 Service roles – AWS RoboMaker supports service roles. This feature allows a service to assume a service role on your behalf. This role allows the service to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Service roles appear in your IAM account, and are owned by the account. This means that an IAM administrator can change the permissions for this role. However, this might break the functionality of the service.

I am not authorized to perform an action in AWS RoboMaker
If you receive an error in the AWS Management Console that tells you that you're not authorized to perform an action, then you must contact the administrator that provided you with your user name and password. 
The following example error occurs when an IAM user named my-user-name tries to use the console to perform the CreateRobotApplication action, but does not have permissions.
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/my-user-name is not authorized to perform: aws-robomaker:CreateRobotApplication on resource: my-example-robot-application
For this example, ask your administrator to update your policies to allow you to access the my-example-robot-application resource using the aws-robomaker:CreateRobotApplication action.
I'm an administrator and want to allow others to access AWS RoboMaker
To allow others to access AWS RoboMaker you must create an IAM entity (user or role) for the person or application that needs access. They will use the credentials for that entity to access AWS. You must then attach a policy to the entity that grants them the correct permissions in AWS RoboMaker.
