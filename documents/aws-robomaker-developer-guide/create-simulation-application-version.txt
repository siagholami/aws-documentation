Creating a Simulation Application Version
When you create a simulation application version, you create an immutable snapshot of the $LATEST version. It cannot be updated. It will not change even if the $LATEST version is updated.
To create a simulation application version
Follow the steps under one of the following tabs.

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Development, and then choose Simulation applications.


Select the simulation application name.


In the Simulation applications details page, select Create new version, and then select Create.



[ Using the AWS CLI ]
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based create robot application on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker create-simulation-application-version --name my-simulation-application-arn
