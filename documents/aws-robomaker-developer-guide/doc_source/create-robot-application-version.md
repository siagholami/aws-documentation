# Creating a Robot Application Version<a name="create-robot-application-version"></a>

When you create a robot application, there is only one versionâ€”the `$LATEST` version\. The `$LATEST` version can be updated with new a new version of the application any time\. If many people are making changes, or the robot application is updated frequently, you might not know all the details about the `$LATEST` version\. 

When you create a robot application version, you create an immutable snapshot of the `$LATEST` version\. It cannot be updated, so it will not change even if the `$LATEST` version is updated\. This is useful for deployments, when you need to have the same version on all of the robots in a fleet\.

You can use any version of a robot application when you create a simulation job\. For deployments, you must use a numbered version\.
