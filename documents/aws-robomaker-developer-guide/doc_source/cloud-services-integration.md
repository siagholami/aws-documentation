# AWS RoboMaker Cloud Extensions<a name="cloud-services-integration"></a>

AWS RoboMaker cloud extensions is a collection of ROS packages you can use with your robot and simulation applications to easily access AWS\. The extensions enable a number of exciting scenarios\. For example you might capture video and other sensor data from your physical robot as it explores the environment\. You might provide a voice for your robot and process voice commands\. You might recognize faces and objects\.

Available packages include the following\.
+  **Amazon CloudWatch Metrics** — Stream sensor data, performance metrics, and other information from your robots\. View data over time and set alarms to receive alerts if data reaches certain thresholds \(like low battery\)\. 
+  **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** — Stream logging data from your robot fleets to a central place for easy analysis\. Search data generated by hundreds of robots in one place\. 
+  **Amazon Kinesis Video Streams** — Stream real\-time video from your robot into AWS\. 
+  **Amazon Lex** — Create a robot with engaging user experiences and lifelike conversation\. 
+  **Amazon Polly** — Turn text into speech using lifelike voices in different languages\. 

To see these extensions in action, visit the AWS RoboMaker sample application page [AWS RoboMaker sample applications](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/home?#sampleSimulationJobs)\. You can quickly and easily launch and engage with different robot simulations\.

## Prerequisites<a name="cloud-services-integration-prereq"></a>

To use the AWS RoboMaker cloud extensions, you must have:
+ An AWS account\. To sign up for an AWS account, see [Step 1: Create an AWS Account and an Administrator](gs-set-up.md)\. 
+ AWS credentials\. These credentials are used to access AWS services\. 
+ Configure IAM role permissions to allow AWS RoboMaker cloud extensions to use AWS services\. The permissions needed are included in the README files included with each extension\.
+ ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16\.04, ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18\.04, or ROS 2 Dashing on Ubuntu 18\.04\. If you are using an AWS RoboMaker development environment, it is preconfigured for robotics development with the chosen distribution\. For more information about ROS 2 Dashing, see [ROS 2 Dashing \(Beta\)](robomaker-ros2-beta.md)\.\.
