# Voice Commands<a name="gs-voice"></a>

In this section, explore a robot that accepts commands through natural language text and voice in a simulated bookstore using Amazon Lex\. The robot supports the commands **move \[direction\] \[rate\]** or **turn \[direction\] \[rate\]**, and **stop**\. Each command is acknowledged and then executed\. 

Before you use AWS RoboMaker for the first time, complete the tasks in [Create an Account](gs-set-up.md)\. Then, in the AWS RoboMaker console, launch the Voice Commands sample application\.

Use rqt to view images from the robot's camera\.

**To view simulated camera images**

1. Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/robomaker/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/)\.

1. In the AWS RoboMaker console, choose **Simulation jobs** on the left and then select the **Voice Commands** simulation job\.

1. In the **Simulation details screen**, in the **Simulation tools** section, select **Gazebo**\. Zoom in on the robot\. There are a series of obstacles positioned in front of it\.

1. In the **Simulation details screen**, in the **Simulation tools** section, select **terminal**\.

1. In **terminal**, type in the following commands to set up the robot operating system \(ROS\) environment and run the text command tool\.

   ```
   eval $AWS_ROBOMAKER_ROBOT_APPLICATION_SETUP
   rosrun voice_interaction_robot text_input.py
   ```

1. Type in the following command to see the robot hit obstacles\. The robot is moving forward at 0\.4 meters per second\.

   ```
   move forward 0.4
   ```

   The robot tries to move forward until it is told to stop\. The faster the robot moves, the more the obstacles are displaced\. Reasonable speeds are 0\.3â€“0\.5 meters per second\.

   You can also move the robot backward\.

   ```
   move backward 0.4
   ```

1. The robot can be commanded to turn clockwise or counterclockwise\. For example:

   ```
   turn clockwise .5
   turn counterclockwise .65
   ```

   The turn rate is radians per second\. Values between 0\.4 and 0\.78 are reasonable for the robot\.

1. Type **stop** to stop the robot\.
