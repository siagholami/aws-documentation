# Managing Simulation Job Batches<a name="simulation-job-batch"></a>

This section provides information about how you can start and manage simulation job batches\. Using a simulation job batch, you can launch and run many simulations using a single API call\. This makes it easy to perform regression testing, parameter optimization, machine learning model training, and synthetic data generation\. 

**Note**  
Simulation job batches can only be started using the AWS RoboMaker SDK or AWS CLI\. You can view, clone, and cancel simulation batches using the AWS RoboMaker console\.
