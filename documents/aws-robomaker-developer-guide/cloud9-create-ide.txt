Note
Completing these procedures might result in charges to your AWS account. These include possible charges for services such as Amazon EC2 and AWS RoboMaker. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Pricing, AWS RoboMaker Pricing, and Cloud Services Pricing. 
To create a development environment
Follow these steps:


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Development, and then choose IDEs.


In the Create AWS RoboMaker development environment page, type a name for the environment.


Choose a ROS Distribution. For more information about the Robot Operating System (ROS), see www.ros.org. For more information about using ROS 2 with AWS RoboMaker, see ROS 2 Dashing (Beta).


For Instance type, choose an instance type with the amount of RAM and vCPUs you think you need for the kinds of tasks you want to do. Or leave the default choice.
Note
Choosing instance types with more RAM and vCPUs might result in additional charges to your AWS account for Amazon EC2. 


In Networking, if your development environment needs to access resources on an Amazon VPC, select the VPC and subnets. 


Choose Create to create the development environment. 


On the Environment details page, choose Open environment. It might take a few moments to prepare the environment. 


You can list available development environments by choosing Development in the left navigation pane, then choosing Development environments.
