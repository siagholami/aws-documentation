SimulationJobBatchSummary
Information about a simulation job batch.
Contents
arn 
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the batch.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1224.
Pattern: arn:.* 
Required: No
createdAt 
The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the simulation job batch was created.
Type: Timestamp
Required: No
createdRequestCount 
The number of created simulation job requests.
Type: Integer
Required: No
failedRequestCount 
The number of failed simulation job requests.
Type: Integer
Required: No
lastUpdatedAt 
The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the simulation job batch was last updated.
Type: Timestamp
Required: No
pendingRequestCount 
The number of pending simulation job requests.
Type: Integer
Required: No
status 
The status of the simulation job batch.  
Pending
The simulation job batch request is pending.
InProgress
The simulation job batch is in progress. 
Failed
The simulation job batch failed. One or more simulation job requests could not be completed due to an internal failure (like InternalServiceError). See failureCode and failureReason for more information.
Completed
The simulation batch job completed. A batch is complete when (1) there are no pending simulation job requests in the batch and none of the failed simulation job requests are due to InternalServiceError and (2) when all created simulation jobs have reached a terminal state (for example, Completed or Failed). 
Canceled
The simulation batch job was cancelled.
Canceling
The simulation batch job is being cancelled.
Completing
The simulation batch job is completing.
TimingOut
The simulation job batch is timing out.
If a batch timing out, and there are pending requests that were failing due to an internal failure (like InternalServiceError), the batch status will be Failed. If there are no such failing request, the batch status will be TimedOut. 
TimedOut
The simulation batch job timed out.
Type: String
Valid Values:Pending | InProgress | Failed | Completed | Canceled | Canceling | Completing | TimingOut | TimedOut 
Required: No
