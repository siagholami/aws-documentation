Viewing a Deployment Job
Once a deployment job is created, you can view its details and track the deployment status.
To see the details of a deployment job
Follow the steps under one of the following tabs:

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Fleet management, then choose Deployments.


Click on the Id of a deployment job to see details about the job including the time it was created and robot application version, deployment status, and the status of each robot in the fleet.



[ Using the AWS CLI ]
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based view deployment job on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker list-deployment-jobs
$ aws robomaker describe-deployment-job --job my-deployment-job-arn
