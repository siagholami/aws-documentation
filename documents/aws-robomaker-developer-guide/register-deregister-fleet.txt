Registering and Deregistering Robots
You can register (add) and deregister (remove) robots from fleets. This is useful if you want to remove a robot from a fleet for maintenance or move a robot from one fleet to another fleet.
You can register a robot to a single fleet only. 
Register a robot
To register a robot to a fleet, follow the steps under one of the following tabs:

[ Using the console ]


Sign in to the AWS RoboMaker console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/.


In the left navigation pane, choose Fleet Management, and then choose Fleets.


Select the Name of the fleet you want to modify.


In the Fleet details page, select Register.


In the Register robots page, select the robot you want to register, then select Register robots.



[ Using the AWS CLI ]
Example
Here's an example AWS CLI command that performs the equivalent of the console-based robot registration on the other tab.  
$ aws robomaker register-robot --fleet my-fleet-arn --robot my-robot-arn
