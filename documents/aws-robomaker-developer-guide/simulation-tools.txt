Simulation Tools
AWS RoboMaker provides Gazebo, rqt, rviz and terminal access to interact with running simulation jobs. 
Common tasks include:

The IAM user or role used to create simulation will automatically have permission to access the simulation tools. If it is a different user or role, it should have the robomaker:CreateSimulationJob privilege.
