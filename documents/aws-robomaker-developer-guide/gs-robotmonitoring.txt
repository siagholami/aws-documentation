Robot Monitoring
This section shows how to monitor health and operational metrics for a robot in a simulated bookstore using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics and Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The streams metrics including speed, distance to nearest obstacle, distance to current goal, robot CPU utilization, and RAM usage. 
Before you use AWS RoboMaker for the first time, complete the tasks in Create an Account. Then, in the AWS RoboMaker console, launch the Robot Monitoring sample application.

The Robot Monitoring sample application uses AWS RoboMaker cloud extensions to write custom health and performance metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.
To view robot health and performance metrics


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the CloudWatch console, select Metrics. 


On the Metrics page, in the All metrics tab, select the Robot Monitoring example. 


On the Metrics page, in the All metrics tab, select Robot. These are the operational metrics for the robot. 


Select all of the metrics. Each metric will appear on the graph in a different color. 


Hover over the graph to see values for that moment. You can also select a region on the graph to zoom in or select custom at the top of the page to select a custom time period.


View CloudWatch Logs
When a simulation job runs, logs are generated by simulation tools and the applications in the simulation job.
To view the logs


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the CloudWatch console, select Logs. 


On the Log groups page, select the Robot Monitoring Log Group, and then select Turtlebot3. 


Select an event to see details. For example, if you filter for monitor_obstacle_distance events, you can see the distance to the nearest obstacle at that moment.
