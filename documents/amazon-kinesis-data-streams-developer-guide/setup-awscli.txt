Step 2: Set Up the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
In this step, you download and configure the AWS CLI to use with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for Java Applications.
Note
The getting started exercises in this guide assume that you are using administrator credentials (adminuser) in your account to perform the operations.
Note
If you already have the AWS CLI installed, you might need to upgrade to get the latest functionality. For more information, see  Installing the AWS Command Line Interface in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. To check the version of the AWS CLI, run the following command:  
aws --version
The exercises in this tutorial require the following AWS CLI version or later:  
aws-cli/1.16.63
To set up the AWS CLI


Download and configure the AWS CLI. For instructions, see the following topics in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide: 
    Installing the AWS Command Line Interface
    Configuring the AWS CLI


Add a named profile for the administrator user in the AWS CLI config file. You use this profile when executing the AWS CLI commands. For more information about named profiles, see Named Profiles in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.


[profile adminuser]
   aws_access_key_id = adminuser access key ID
   aws_secret_access_key = adminuser secret access key
   region = aws-region
For a list of available AWS Regions, see AWS Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

Verify the setup by entering the following help command at the command prompt: 

aws help
After you set up an AWS account and the AWS CLI, you can try the next exercise, in which you configure a sample application and test the end-to-end setup.
