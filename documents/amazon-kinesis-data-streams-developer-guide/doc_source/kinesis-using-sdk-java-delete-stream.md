# Deleting a Stream<a name="kinesis-using-sdk-java-delete-stream"></a>

You can delete a stream with the Kinesis Data Streams console, or programmatically\. To delete a stream programmatically, use `DeleteStreamRequest`, as shown in the following code\.

```
DeleteStreamRequest deleteStreamRequest = new DeleteStreamRequest();
deleteStreamRequest.setStreamName(myStreamName);
client.deleteStream(deleteStreamRequest);
```

Shut down any applications that are operating on the stream before you delete it\. If an application attempts to operate on a deleted stream, it receives `ResourceNotFound` exceptions\. Also, if you subsequently create a new stream that has the same name as your previous stream, and applications that were operating on the previous stream are still running, these applications might try to interact with the new stream as though it were the previous streamâ€”with unpredictable results\.
