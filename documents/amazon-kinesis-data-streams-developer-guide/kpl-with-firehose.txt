Using the KPL with Kinesis Data Firehose
If you use the Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) to write data to a Kinesis data stream, you can use aggregation to combine the records that you write to that Kinesis data stream. If you then use that data stream as a source for your Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, Kinesis Data Firehose de-aggregates the records before it delivers them to the destination. If you configure your delivery stream to transform the data, Kinesis Data Firehose de-aggregates the records before it delivers them to AWS Lambda.
