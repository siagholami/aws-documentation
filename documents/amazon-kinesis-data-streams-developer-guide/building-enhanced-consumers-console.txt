Managing Enhanced Fan-Out Consumers with the AWS Management Console
Consumers that use enhanced fan-out in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams can receive records from a data stream with dedicated throughput of up to 2 MB of data per second per shard. For more information, see Developing Custom Consumers with Dedicated Throughput (Enhanced Fan-Out).
You can use the AWS Management Console to see a list of all the consumers that are registered to use enhanced fan-out with a specific stream. For each such consumer, you can see details such as ARN, status, and creation date, in addition to the monitoring metrics and the tags associated with the consumer.
