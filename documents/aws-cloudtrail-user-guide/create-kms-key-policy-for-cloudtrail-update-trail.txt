Updating a Trail to Use Your CMK
To update a trail to use the customer master key (CMK) that you modified for CloudTrail, complete the following steps in the CloudTrail console.
Note
Updating a trail with the following procedure encrypts the log files but not the digest files with SSE-KMS.  Digest files are encrypted with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3).
To update a trail using the AWS CLI, see Enabling and disabling CloudTrail log file encryption with the AWS CLI.
To update a trail to use your CMK


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/.


Choose Trails and then choose a trail.


For Storage location, choose the pencil icon.


For Encrypt log files with SSE-KMS, choose Yes to have CloudTrail encrypt your log files with the CMK.


For Create a new KMS key, choose No.


For KMS key, choose the CMK alias whose policy you modified for use with CloudTrail.
Note
Choose a CMK that is in the same region as the S3 bucket that receives your log files. To verify the region for an S3 bucket, view its properties in the S3 console.


You can type the alias name, ARN, or the globally unique key ID. If the CMK belongs to another account, verify that the key policy has permissions that enable you to use it. The value can be one of the following formats:
    Alias Name: alias/MyAliasName
    Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:region:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName 
    Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:region:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 
    Globally unique key ID: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 

Choose Save.
Note
If the CMK that you chose is disabled or is pending deletion, you cannot save the trail with that CMK. You can enable the CMK or choose another one. For more information, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key.
