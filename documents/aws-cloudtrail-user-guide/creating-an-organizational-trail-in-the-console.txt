Creating a Trail For Your Organization in the Console
To create an organization trail in the CloudTrail console, you must sign in to the console using an IAM user or role in the master account with sufficient permissions. If you are not signed in with the master account, you will not see the option to apply a trail to an organization when you create or edit a trail in the CloudTrail console. 
You can choose to configure an organization trail in various ways. For example, you can: 
 Specify if you want the trail to apply to all regions or a single region. The default is to create a trail for all regions. For more information, see How CloudTrail Works.
 Specify whether to apply the trail to your organization. The default is not to do so; you must choose this option to create an organization trail.
 Specify which Amazon S3 bucket to use to receive log files for the organization trail. You can choose an existing Amazon S3 bucket in the master account, or create one specifically for the organization trail. 
 For management and data events, specify if you want to log read-only, write-only, or all events. Insights events are based only on write events. You can specify logging data events for specific Amazon S3 buckets and AWS Lambda functions in the master account by choosing them from the lists in the console, and in member accounts if you specify the ARNs of each resource for which you want to enable data event logging. For more information, see Data Events.
To create an organization trail with the AWS Management Console

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/.

You must be signed in as a user, role, or root account in the master account with sufficient permissions to create an organization trail.


In the region selector, choose the region where you want the trail to be created.


Choose Trails, and then choose Create trail.
Tip
If you see Get Started Now instead of Trails, choose it.


On the Create Trail page, for Trail name, type a name for your organization trail. This name must be unique in the master account and in all member accounts. Keep in mind that this trail name will appear in all member accounts in the CloudTrail console for those accounts, as well as in the list of trails provided by the AWS CLI and API. Consider providing an easily understood name for this trail that meets the naming requirements. For more information, see CloudTrail Trail Naming Requirements.


For Apply trail to all regions, choose Yes to receive log files from all regions. This is the default and recommended setting. If you choose No, the trail logs files only from the region in which you create the trail.


For Apply trail to my organization, choose Yes. You will only see this option if you are signed in to the console with an IAM user or role in the master account. To successfully create an organization trail, be sure that the user or role has sufficient permissions.


For Management events, for Read/Write events, choose if you want your trail to log All, Read-only, Write-only, or None. By default, trails log all management events. For more information, see Management Events.


In Insights events, for Log Insights events, choose Yes if you want your trail to log Insights events. By default, trails don't log Insights events. For more information about Insights events, see Logging Insights Events for Trails. This choice applies to all accounts in the organization. Additional charges apply for logging Insights events. For CloudTrail pricing, see AWS CloudTrail Pricing.


For Data events, you can specify logging data events for Amazon S3 buckets, for AWS Lambda functions. You can choose from the lists of specific Amazon S3 buckets and Lambda functions in the master account, but these lists do not include any resource information for member accounts. To add specific resources in member accounts, you must provide the ARNs of Amazon S3 buckets and Lambda functions. Alternatively, you can select the option to log all Amazon S3 buckets and Lambda functions. This choice applies to all accounts in the organization. 


By default, trails don't log data events. Additional charges apply for logging data events. For CloudTrail pricing, see AWS CloudTrail Pricing. 
For Amazon S3 buckets:
    Choose the S3 tab.
    To specify a bucket in the master account, choose Add S3 bucket. Either choose the bucket from the list that appears when you choose Bucket name, or type the S3 bucket name and prefix (optional) for which you want to log data events. For each bucket, specify whether you want to log Read events, such as GetObject, Write events, such as PutObject, or both. For more information, see Data Events.
    To specify a bucket in a member account, choose Add S3 bucket. Type or paste the ARN for that bucket into Bucket name. For each bucket, specify whether you want to log Read events, such as GetObject, Write events, such as PutObject, or both. For more information, see Data Events.
    To log data events for all S3 buckets in all accounts in your organization, select Select all S3 buckets in your account. Then choose whether you want to log Read events, such as GetObject, Write events, such as PutObject, or both. This setting takes precedence over individual settings you configure for individual buckets in master and member accounts. For example, if you specify logging Read events for all S3 buckets, and then choose to add a specific bucket for data event logging, Read is already selected for the bucket you added. You cannot clear the selection. You can only configure the option for Write. 
Note
Selecting the Select all S3 buckets in your account option enables data event logging for all buckets in all accounts currently in your organization and any buckets created in the master and member accounts after you finish creating the trail. It also enables logging of data event activity performed by any user or role in your master account, even if that activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another AWS account outside of your organization.
If the trail applies only to one region, selecting the Select all S3 buckets in your account option enables data event logging for all buckets in the organization in the same region as your trail and any buckets created in the master and member accounts in that region after you enable the option. It will not log data events for Amazon S3 buckets in other regions in your organization.
For Lambda functions:
    Choose the Lambda tab.
    To specify logging data events for individual functions in your master account, select them from the list. Only functions in the master account are listed. Functions in member accounts do not appear in the list.
Note
If you have more than 15,000 Lambda functions in your master account, you cannot view or select all functions in the CloudTrail console when creating a trail. You can still select the option to log all functions, even if they are not displayed. If you want to log data events for specific functions, you can manually add a function if you know its ARN. You can also finish creating the trail in the console, and then use the AWS CLI and the put-event-selectors command to configure data event logging for specific Lambda functions. For more information, see Managing Trails With the AWS CLI.
    To specify logging data events for individual functions in member accounts, choose Add function, and then type or paste the ARN of the function in the member account.
    To log data events for all Lambda functions in your organization, select Log all current and future functions. This setting takes precedence over individual settings you configure for individual functions. All functions are logged, even if all functions are not displayed.
Note
If you are creating a trail for all regions, this selection enables data event logging for all functions currently in your organization, and any Lambda functions that might be created in the master and member accounts in any region after you finish creating the trail. If you are creating a trail for a single region, this selection enables data event logging for all functions currently in that region in all accounts in your organization, and any Lambda functions created in that region in the master and member accounts after you finish creating the trail. It does not enable data event logging for Lambda functions created in other regions.
Logging data events for all functions also enables logging of data event activity performed by any user or role in your master account, even if that activity is performed on a function that belongs to another AWS account outside of the organization.


For Storage location, for Create a new S3 bucket, choose Yes to create a bucket. When you create a bucket, CloudTrail creates and applies the required bucket policies for an organization trail.
Note
If you choose No, choose an existing Amazon S3 bucket. The bucket policy will be updated to allow for logging for an organization trail. For information about manually creating or editing the bucket policy, see Creating a Trail for an Organization with the AWS Command Line Interface.


For S3 bucket, type a name for the bucket you want to designate for log file storage. The name must be globally unique. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements.


To configure advanced settings, see Configuring Advanced Settings for Your Organization Trail. Otherwise, choose Create.


The new trail appears on the Trails page. An organization trail might take up to 24 hours to be created in all regions in all member accounts. The Trails page shows the trails in your account from all regions. In about 15 minutes, CloudTrail publishes log files that show the AWS API calls made in your organization. You can see the log files in the Amazon S3 bucket that you specified.


Note
You can't rename a trail after it has been created. Instead, you can delete the trail and create a new one. 
Configuring Advanced Settings for Your Organization Trail
You can configure the following settings for your organization trail:
 Specify a log file prefix for the Amazon S3 bucket receiving log files.
 Encrypt log files with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) instead of the default encryption (Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3)).
 Enable log file validation for logs.
 Configure Amazon SNS to notify you when log files are delivered.
To configure advanced settings for your trail


For Storage location, choose Advanced.


In the Log file prefix field, type a prefix for your Amazon S3 bucket. The prefix is an addition to the URL for an Amazon S3 object that creates a folder-like organization in your bucket. The location where your log files will be stored appears under the text field.


For Encrypt log files with SSE-KMS, choose Yes if you want to encrypt your log files with SSE-KMS instead of SSE-S3.


For Create a new KMS key, choose Yes to create a key in the master account or No to use an existing one in the master account.


If you chose Yes, in the KMS key field, type an alias. CloudTrail encrypts your log files with the key and adds the policy for you.
Note
If you choose No, choose an existing KMS key. You can also type the ARN of a key from another account. For more information, see Updating a Trail to Use Your CMK. The key policy must allow CloudTrail to use the key to encrypt your log files, and allow the users you specify to read log files in unencrypted form. For information about manually editing the key policy, see Configure AWS KMS Key Policies for CloudTrail.


For Enable log file validation, choose Yes to have log digests delivered to your Amazon S3 bucket. You can use the digest files to verify that your log files did not change after CloudTrail delivered them. For more information, see Validating CloudTrail Log File Integrity. 


For Send SNS notification for every log file delivery, choose Yes if you want to be notified each time a log is delivered to your bucket. CloudTrail stores multiple events in a log file. SNS notifications are sent for every log file, not for every event. 


For Create a new SNS topic, choose Yes to create a topic, or choose No to use an existing topic. If you are creating a trail that applies to all regions, SNS notifications for log file deliveries from all regions are sent to the single SNS topic that you create.
Note
If you choose No, choose an existing topic. You can also enter the ARN of a topic from another region or from an account with appropriate permissions. For more information, see Amazon SNS Topic Policy for CloudTrail.


If you choose Yes, in the SNS topic field, type a name.


If you create a topic, you must subscribe to the topic to be notified of log file delivery. You can subscribe from the Amazon SNS console. Due to the frequency of notifications, we recommend that you configure the subscription to use an Amazon SQS queue to handle notifications programmatically. For more information, see the Amazon Simple Notification Service Getting Started Guide.

Choose Create.

Next Steps
After you create your trail, you can return to the trail to make changes:
 Change the configuration of your trail by editing it. For more information, see Updating a Trail.
 Configure the Amazon S3 bucket to allow specific IAM users in member accounts to read the log files for the organization, if desired. For more information, see Sharing CloudTrail Log Files Between AWS Accounts.
 Configure CloudTrail to send log files to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see Sending Events to CloudWatch Logs and the CloudWatch Logs item in Prepare For Creating a Trail For Your Organization.
 Create a table and use it to run a query in Amazon Athena to analyze your AWS service activity. For more information, see Creating a Table for CloudTrail Logs in the CloudTrail Console in the Amazon Athena User Guide.
 Add custom tags (key-value pairs) to the trail.
 To create another organization trail, return to the Trails page and choose Create trail.
Note
When configuring a trail, you can choose an Amazon S3 bucket and SNS topic that belong to another account. However, if you want CloudTrail to deliver events to a CloudWatch Logs log group, you must choose a log group that exists in your current account.
