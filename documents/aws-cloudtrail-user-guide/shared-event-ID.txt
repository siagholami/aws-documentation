sharedEventID Example
The following is an example that describes how CloudTrail delivers two events for the same action:


Alice has AWS account (111111111111) and creates a customer master key (CMK). She is the owner of this CMK. 


Bob has AWS account (222222222222). Alice gives Bob permission to use the CMK. 


Each account has a trail and a separate bucket.


Bob uses the CMK to call the Encrypt API. 


CloudTrail sends two separate events. 
    One event is sent to Bob. The event shows that he used the CMK.
    One event is sent to Alice. The event shows that Bob used the CMK.
    The events have the same sharedEventID, but the eventID and recipientAccountID are unique.



Shared Event IDs in CloudTrail Insights
A sharedEventID for CloudTrail Insights events differs from the sharedEventID for the management and data types of CloudTrail events. In Insights events, a sharedEventID is a GUID that is generated by CloudTrail Insights to uniquely identify a start and end pair of Insights events. sharedEventID is common between the start and the end Insights event, and helps to create a correlation between both events to uniquely identify unusual activity.
You can think of the sharedEventID as the overall Insights event ID.
