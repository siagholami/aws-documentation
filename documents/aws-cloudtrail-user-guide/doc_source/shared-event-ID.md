# sharedEventID Example<a name="shared-event-ID"></a>

The following is an example that describes how CloudTrail delivers two events for the same action:

1.  Alice has AWS account \(111111111111\) and creates a customer master key \(CMK\)\. She is the owner of this CMK\. 

1.  Bob has AWS account \(222222222222\)\. Alice gives Bob permission to use the CMK\. 

1.  Each account has a trail and a separate bucket\.

1.  Bob uses the CMK to call the `Encrypt` API\. 

1.  CloudTrail sends two separate events\. 
   + One event is sent to Bob\. The event shows that he used the CMK\.
   + One event is sent to Alice\. The event shows that Bob used the CMK\.
   + The events have the same `sharedEventID`, but the `eventID` and `recipientAccountID` are unique\.

## Shared Event IDs in CloudTrail Insights<a name="shared-event-ID-insights"></a>

A `sharedEventID` for CloudTrail Insights events differs from the `sharedEventID` for the management and data types of CloudTrail events\. In Insights events, a `sharedEventID` is a GUID that is generated by CloudTrail Insights to uniquely identify a start and end pair of Insights events\. `sharedEventID` is common between the start and the end Insights event, and helps to create a correlation between both events to uniquely identify unusual activity\.

You can think of the `sharedEventID` as the overall Insights event ID\.
