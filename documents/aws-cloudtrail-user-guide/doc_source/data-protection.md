# Data Protection in AWS CloudTrail<a name="data-protection"></a>

AWS CloudTrail conforms to the AWS [shared responsibility model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/), which includes regulations and guidelines for data protection\. AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all the AWS services\. AWS maintains control over data hosted on this infrastructure, including the security configuration controls for handling customer content and personal data\. AWS customers and APN partners, acting either as data controllers or data processors, are responsible for any personal data that they put in the AWS Cloud\. 

For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect AWS account credentials and set up individual user accounts with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\), so that each user is given only the permissions necessary to fulfill their job duties\. We also recommend that you secure your data in the following ways:
+ Use multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) with each account\.
+ Use SSL/TLS to communicate with AWS resources\.
+ Create a trail to log API and user activity with AWS CloudTrail\.
+ Use AWS encryption solutions, along with all default security controls within AWS services\.
+ Use advanced managed security services such as Amazon Macie, which assists in discovering and securing personal data that is stored in Amazon S3\.

We strongly recommend that you never put sensitive identifying information, such as your customers' account numbers, into free\-form fields such as a **Name** field\. This includes when you work with CloudTrail or other AWS services using the console, API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs\. Any data that you enter into CloudTrail or other services might get picked up for inclusion in diagnostic logs\. When you provide a URL to an external server, don't include credentials information in the URL to validate your request to that server\.

For more information about data protection, see the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model and GDPR](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/the-aws-shared-responsibility-model-and-gdpr/) blog post on the *AWS Security Blog*\.

By default, CloudTrail event log files are encrypted using Amazon S3 server\-side encryption \(SSE\)\. You can also choose to encrypt your log files with an AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) key\. You can store your log files in your bucket for as long as you want\. You can also define Amazon S3 lifecycle rules to archive or delete log files automatically\. If you want notifications about log file delivery and validation, you can set up Amazon SNS notifications\.

The following security best practices also address data protection in CloudTrail:
+ [Encrypting CloudTrail Log Files with AWS KMSâ€“Managed Keys \(SSE\-KMS\)](encrypting-cloudtrail-log-files-with-aws-kms.md)
+ [Amazon S3 Bucket Policy for CloudTrail](create-s3-bucket-policy-for-cloudtrail.md)
+ [Validating CloudTrail Log File Integrity](cloudtrail-log-file-validation-intro.md)
+ [Sharing CloudTrail Log Files Between AWS Accounts](cloudtrail-sharing-logs.md)

Because CloudTrail logs files are stored in a bucket or buckets in Amazon S3, you should also review the data protection information in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide\.
