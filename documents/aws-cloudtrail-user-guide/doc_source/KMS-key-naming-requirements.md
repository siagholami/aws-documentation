# AWS KMS Alias Naming Requirements<a name="KMS-key-naming-requirements"></a>

When you create a customer master key \(CMK\), you can choose an alias to identify it\. For example, you might choose the alias "KMS\-CloudTrail\-us\-west\-2" to encrypt the logs for a specific trail\.

The alias must meet the following requirements:
+ Between 1 and 32 characters, inclusive
+ Contain alphanumeric characters \(A\-Z, a\-z, 0\-9\), hyphens \(\-\), forward slashes \(/\), and underscores \(\_\)
+ Cannot begin with **aws**
