# Viewing CloudTrail Insights Events<a name="view-insights-events"></a>

After you enable CloudTrail Insights on a trail, you can view up to 90 days of Insights events by using the CloudTrail console or the AWS CLI\. This section describes how to view, look up, and download a file of Insights events\. For information about using the `LookupEvents` API to retrieve information from CloudTrail events, see the [AWS CloudTrail API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/)\. For more information about CloudTrail Insights, see [Logging Insights Events for Trails](logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.md) in this guide\.

For information about how to create a trail so that you have a record of events that extends past 90 days, see [Creating a Trail](cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.md) and [Getting and Viewing Your CloudTrail Log Files](get-and-view-cloudtrail-log-files.md)\.
