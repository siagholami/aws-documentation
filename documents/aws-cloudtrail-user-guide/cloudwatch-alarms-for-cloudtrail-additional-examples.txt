Creating CloudWatch Alarms for CloudTrail Events: Additional Examples
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices  recommend that you do not use your root account credentials to access AWS. Instead, you should  create individual IAM users so that you can give each user a unique set of security credentials. The IAM Best Practices also recommend that you  enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)  for IAM users who are allowed access to sensitive resources or APIs. 
You can monitor whether activity in your AWS account adheres to these best practices by creating the CloudWatch alarms that notify you when root account credentials have been used to access AWS, or when API activity or console sign-ins without MFA have occurred. These alarms are described in this document.
Configuring an alarm involves two main steps: 
 Create a metric filter 
 Create an alarm based on the filter
Topics
 Example: Monitor for Root Usage
 Example: Monitor for API Activity Without Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
 Example: Monitor for Console Sign In Without Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
Example: Monitor for Root Usage
This scenario walks you through how to use the AWS Management Console to create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that is triggered when root (account) credentials are used.
Create a Metric Filter


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Logs.


In the list of log groups, select the check box next to the log group that you created for CloudTrail log events.


Choose Create Metric Filter.


On the Define Logs Metric Filter screen, choose Filter Pattern and then type the following:


{ $.userIdentity.type = "Root" && $.userIdentity.invokedBy NOT EXISTS && $.eventType != "AwsServiceEvent" }
Note
For more information about syntax for metric filters and patterns for CloudTrail log events, see the JSON-related sections of Filter and Pattern Syntax in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.


Choose Assign Metric, and then on the Create Metric Filter and Assign a Metric screen, in the Filter Name box, enter RootAccountUsage


Under Metric Details, in the Metric Namespace box, enter CloudTrailMetrics.


In the Metric Name field, enter RootAccountUsageCount.


Choose Metric Value, and then type 1. 
Note
If Metric Value does not appear, choose Show advanced metric settings first.


When you are finished, choose Create Filter.


Create an Alarm
These steps are a continuation of the previous steps for creating a metric filter.


On the Filters for Log_Group_Name page, next to the filter name, choose Create Alarm.


On the Create Alarm page, provide the following values.

When you are finished, choose Create Alarm.

Example: Monitor for API Activity Without Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
This scenario walks you through how to use the AWS Management Console to create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that is triggered when API calls are made without the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA).

In the list of log groups, select the check box next to the log group that you created for CloudTrail log events.


Choose Create Metric Filter.


On the Define Logs Metric Filter screen, choose Filter Pattern and then type the following:


{ $.userIdentity.sessionContext.attributes.mfaAuthenticated != "true" }
Note
For more information about syntax for metric filters and patterns for CloudTrail log events, see the JSON-related sections of Filter and Pattern Syntax in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.


Choose Assign Metric, and then on the Create Metric Filter and Assign a Metric screen, in the Filter Name box, enter ApiActivityWithoutMFA.


Under Metric Details, in the Metric Namespace box, enter CloudTrailMetrics.


In the Metric Name box, enter ApiActivityWithoutMFACount.


Choose Metric Value, and then type 1.
Note
If Metric Value does not appear, choose Show advanced metric settings first.
