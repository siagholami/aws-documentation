Launching and Configuring a DLAMI
If you're here you should already have a good idea of which AMI you want to launch. If not, choose a DLAMI using the AMI selection guidelines found throughout Getting Started or use the full listing of AMIs in the Appendix section, AMI Options. 
You should also know which instance type and region you're going to choose. If not, browse Selecting the Instance Type for DLAMI. 
Note
We will use p2.xlarge as the default instance type in the examples. Just replace this with whichever instance type you have in mind.
Important
If you plan to use Elastic Inference, you have Elastic Inference Setup that must be completed prior to launching your DLAMI.
