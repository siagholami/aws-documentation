Chainer
Chainer is a flexible Python-based framework for easily and intuitively writing complex neural network architectures. Chainer makes it easy to use multi-GPU instances for training. Chainer also automatically logs results, graph loss and accuracy, and produces output for visualizing the neural network with a computational graph. It is included with the Deep Learning AMI with Conda (DLAMI with Conda). 
Activate Chainer


Connect to the instance running Deep Learning AMI with Conda. Refer to the Selecting the Instance Type for DLAMI or the Amazon EC2 documentation on how to select or connect to an instance.



Activate the Python 3 Chainer environment:

$ source activate chainer_p36
    Activate the Python 2 Chainer environment:
$ source activate chainer_p27


Start the iPython terminal:


(chainer_p36)$ ipython

Test importing Chainer to verify that it is working properly:

import chainer
You may see a few warning messages, but no error.
