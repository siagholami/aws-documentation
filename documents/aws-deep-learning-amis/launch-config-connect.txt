Connect to the DLAMI that you launched from a client (Windows, MacOS, or Linux). For more information, see  Connect to Your Linux Instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. 
Keep a copy of the SSH login command handy if you want to do the Jupyter setup after logging in. You will use a variation of it to connect to the Jupyter webpage.
