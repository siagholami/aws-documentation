Preprocessing
Data preprocessing through transformations or augmentations can often be a CPU-bound process, and this can be the bottleneck in your overall pipeline. Frameworks have built-in operators for image processing, but DALI (Data Augmentation Library) demonstrates improved performance over frameworksâ€™ built-in options.
 NVIDIA Data Augmentation Library (DALI): DALI offloads data augmentation to the GPU. It is not preinstalled on the DLAMI, but you can access it by installing it or loading a supported framework container on your DLAMI or other Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance. Refer to the DALI project page on the NVIDIA website for details.
Tip
Watch this helpful video on the GPU Tech Conference website about optimizing data pipelines. It includes examples of MXNet and TensorFlow using a DALI plugin.
 nvJPEG: a GPU-accelerated JPEG decoder library for C programmers. It supports decoding single images or batches as well as subsequent transformation operations that are common in deep learning. nvJPEG comes built-in with DALI, or you can download from the NVIDIA website's nvjpeg page and use it separately.
