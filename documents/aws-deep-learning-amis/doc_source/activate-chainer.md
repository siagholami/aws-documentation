# Chainer<a name="activate-chainer"></a>

[Chainer](https://chainer.org/) is a flexible Python\-based framework for easily and intuitively writing complex neural network architectures\. Chainer makes it easy to use multi\-GPU instances for training\. Chainer also automatically logs results, graph loss and accuracy, and produces output for visualizing the neural network with a [computational graph](https://docs.chainer.org/en/stable/reference/graph.html)\. It is included with the Deep Learning AMI with Conda \(DLAMI with Conda\)\. 

**Activate Chainer**

1. Connect to the instance running Deep Learning AMI with Conda\. Refer to the [Selecting the Instance Type for DLAMI](instance-select.md) or the [Amazon EC2 documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html) on how to select or connect to an instance\.

1. 
   + Activate the Python 3 Chainer environment:

     ```
     $ source activate chainer_p36
     ```
   + Activate the Python 2 Chainer environment:

     ```
     $ source activate chainer_p27
     ```

1. Start the iPython terminal:

   ```
   (chainer_p36)$ ipython
   ```

1. Test importing Chainer to verify that it is working properly:

   ```
   import chainer
   ```

   You may see a few warning messages, but no error\.
