# Step 4: Test Your DLAMI<a name="launch-config-test"></a>

Depending on your DLAMI version, you have different testing options:
+ [Deep Learning AMI with Conda](overview-conda.md) – go to [Using the Deep Learning AMI with Conda](tutorial-conda.md)\.
+ [Deep Learning Base AMI](overview-base.md) – refer to your desired framework's installation documentation\.

You can also create a Jupyter notebook, try out tutorials, or start coding in Python\. For more information, see [Set up a Jupyter Notebook Server](setup-jupyter.md)\.
