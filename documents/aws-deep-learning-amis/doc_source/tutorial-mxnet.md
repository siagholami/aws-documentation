## Activating MXNet<a name="tutorial-mxnet-overview"></a>

This tutorial shows how to activate MXNet on an instance running the Deep Learning AMI with Conda \(DLAMI on Conda\) and run a MXNet program\.

When a stable Conda package of a framework is released, it's tested and pre\-installed on the DLAMI\. If you want to run the latest, untested nightly build, you can [Installing MXNet's Nightly Build \(experimental\)](#tutorial-mxnet-install) manually\. 

**To run MXNet on the DLAMI with Conda**

1. To activate the framework, open an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instance of the DLAMI with Conda\.
   + For MXNet and Keras 2 on Python 3 with CUDA 9\.0 and MKL\-DNN, run this command:

     ```
     $ source activate mxnet_p36
     ```
   + For MXNet and Keras 2 on Python 2 with CUDA 9\.0 and MKL\-DNN, run this command:

     ```
     $ source activate mxnet_p27
     ```

1. Start the iPython terminal\.

   ```
   (mxnet_p36)$ ipython
   ```

1. Run a quick MXNet program\. Create a 5x5 matrix, an instance of the `NDArray`, with elements initialized to 0\. Print the array\.

   ```
   import mxnet as mx
   mx.ndarray.zeros((5,5)).asnumpy()
   ```

1. Verify the result\.

   ```
   array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
          [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
          [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
          [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
          [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]], dtype=float32)
   ```

## Installing MXNet's Nightly Build \(experimental\)<a name="tutorial-mxnet-install"></a>

You can install the latest MXNet build into either or both of the MXNet Conda environments on your Deep Learning AMI with Conda\.

**To install MXNet from a nightly build**

1. 
   + For the Python 3 MXNet environment, run this command:

     ```
     $ source activate mxnet_p36
     ```
   + For the Python 2 MXNet environment, run this command:

     ```
     $ source activate mxnet_p27
     ```

1. Remove the currently installed MXNet\.
**Note**  
The remaining steps assume you are using the `mxnet_p36` environment\.

   ```
   (mxnet_p36)$ pip uninstall mxnet-cu90mkl
   ```

1. Install the latest nightly build of MXNet\.

   ```
   (mxnet_p36)$ pip install --pre mxnet-cu90mkl
   ```

1. To verify you have successfully installed latest nightly build, start the IPython terminal and check the version of MXNet\.

   ```
   (mxnet_p36)$ ipython
   ```

   ```
   import mxnet
   print (mxnet.__version__)
   ```

   The output should print the latest stable version of MXNet\.
