## FAQ<a name="faq"></a>
+ **Q\.** How do I keep track of product announcements related to DLAMI?

  Here are two suggestions for this:

+ **Q\.** Are the NVIDIA drivers and CUDA installed?

  Yes\. Some DLAMIs have different versions\. The [Deep Learning AMI with Conda](overview-conda.md) has the most recent versions of any DLAMI\. This is covered in more detail in [CUDA Installations and Framework Bindings](overview-cuda.md)\. You can also refer to the specific AMI's detail page on the marketplace to confirm what is installed\.
+ **Q\.** Is cuDNN installed?

  Yes\.
+ **Q\.** How do I see that the GPUs are detected and their current status?

  Run `nvidia-smi`\. This will show one or more GPUs, depending on the instance type, along with their current memory consumption\.
+ **Q\.** Are virtual environments set up for me?

  Yes, but only on the [Deep Learning AMI with Conda](overview-conda.md)\.
+ **Q\.** What version of Python is installed?

  Each DLAMI has both Python 2 and 3\. The [Deep Learning AMI with Conda](overview-conda.md) have environments for both versions for each framework\.
+ **Q\.** Is Keras installed?

  This depends on the AMI\. The [Deep Learning AMI with Conda](overview-conda.md) has Keras available as a front end for each framework\. The version of Keras depends on the framework's support for it\.
+ **Q\.** Is it free?

  All of the DLAMIs are free\. However, depending on the instance type you choose, the instance may not be free\. See [Pricing for the DLAMI](pricing.md) for more info\.
+ **Q\.** I'm getting CUDA errors or GPU\-related messages from my framework\. What's wrong?

  Check what instance type you used\. It needs to have a GPU for many examples and tutorials to work\. If running `nvidia-smi` shows no GPU, then you need to spin up another DLAMI using an instance with one or more GPUs\. See [Selecting the Instance Type for DLAMI](instance-select.md) for more info\.
+ **Q\.** Can I use Docker?

  Docker has been pre\-installed since version 14 of the Deep Learning AMI with Conda\. Note that you will want to use [nvidia\-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) on GPU instances to make use of the GPU\.
+ **Q\.** What regions are Linux DLAMIs available in?
