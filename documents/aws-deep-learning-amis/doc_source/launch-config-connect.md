Connect to the DLAMI that you launched from a client \(Windows, MacOS, or Linux\)\. For more information, see [ Connect to Your Linux Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\. 

Keep a copy of the SSH login command handy if you want to do the Jupyter setup after logging in\. You will use a variation of it to connect to the Jupyter webpage\.
