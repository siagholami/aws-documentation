Keras Tutorial


To activate the framework, use these commands on your Using the Deep Learning AMI with Conda CLI.
    For Keras 2 with an MXNet backend on Python 3 with CUDA 9 with cuDNN 7:
$ source activate mxnet_p36
    For Keras 2 with an MXNet backend on Python 2 with CUDA 9 with cuDNN 7:
$ source activate mxnet_p27
    For Keras 2 with a TensorFlow backend on Python 3 with CUDA 9 with cuDNN 7:
$ source activate tensorflow_p36
    For Keras 2 with a TensorFlow backend on Python 2 with CUDA 9 with cuDNN 7:
$ source activate tensorflow_p27


To test importing Keras to verify which backend is activated, use these commands:


$ ipython
   import keras as k
The following should appear on your screen:
Using MXNet backend
If Keras is using TensorFlow, the following is displayed:
Using TensorFlow backend
Note
If you get an error, or if the wrong backend is still being used, you can update your Keras configuration manually. Edit the ~/.keras/keras.json file and change the backend setting to mxnet or tensorflow.
