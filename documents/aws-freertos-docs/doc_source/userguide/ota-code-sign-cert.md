# Create a code\-signing certificate<a name="ota-code-sign-cert"></a>

To digitally sign firmware images, you need a code\-signing certificate and private key\. For testing purposes, you can create a self‐signed certificate and private key\. For production environments, purchase a certificate through a well‐known certificate authority \(CA\)\.

Different platforms require different types of code\-signing certificates\. The following sections describe how to create code\-signing certificates for different FreeRTOS\-qualified platforms\.
