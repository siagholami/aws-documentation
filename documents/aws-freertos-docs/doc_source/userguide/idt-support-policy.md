AWS IoT Device Tester for FreeRTOS is a test automation tool to validate and [qualify](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/dqp/) your FreeRTOS devices for inclusion in the [AWS Partner Device Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com)\. We recommend that you use the most recent version of FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Tester to test or qualify your devices\. We support AWS IoT Device Tester for the most recent version of FreeRTOS and for FreeRTOS versions released within the previous six months\. The latest version of FreeRTOS is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos)\. For supported versions of AWS IoT Device Tester, see [Supported versions of AWS IoT Device Tester for FreeRTOS](dev-test-versions-afr.md)\. 

For each version of the IDT framework, three versions of the test suite will be supported for qualification of devices\.

You can also use any of the supported versions of AWS IoT Device Tester with the corresponding version of FreeRTOS to test or qualify your devices\. Although you can continue to use [Unsupported IDT versions for FreeRTOS](idt-unsupported-versions-afr.md), these will not receive bug fixes or updates\.
