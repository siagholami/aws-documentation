## Set up the Espressif hardware<a name="setup-hw-espressif-esp32wroom-32se"></a>

For information about setting up the ESP32\-WROOM\-32SE development board hardware, see the [ ESP32\-DevKitC Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/get-started-devkitc.html)\.

**Note**  
Don't follow the **Get Started** section of the Espressif guides\. Instead, follow the steps below\.

## Set up your development environment<a name="setup-env-esp32wroom-32se"></a>

To communicate with your board, you need to download and install a toolchain\.

### Set up the toolchain<a name="setup-esp32wroom-32se-toolchain"></a>

To set up the toolchain, follow the instructions for your host machine's operating system:
+ [ Standard Setup of Toolchain for Windows](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3/get-started-cmake/windows-setup.html)
+ [ Standard Setup of Toolchain for macOS](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3/get-started-cmake/macos-setup.html)
+ [ Standard Setup of Toolchain for Linux](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3/get-started-cmake/linux-setup.html)

**Important**  
When you reach the "Get ESP\-IDF" instructions under **Next Steps**, stop and return to the instructions on this page\.

Make sure that the `IDF_PATH` environment variable is cleared from your system before you continue\. This environment variable is automatically set if you followed the "Get ESP\-IDF" instructions under **Next Steps**\.

**Note**  
Version 3\.3 of the ESP\-IDF \(the version that FreeRTOS uses\) doesn't support the latest version of the ESP32 compiler\. You must use the compiler that is compatible with version 3\.3 of the ESP\-IDF\. See the previous links\. To check the version of your compiler, run the following command\.  

```
xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc --version
```

### Install CMake<a name="gsg-esp32wroom-32se-cmake"></a>

The CMake build system is required to build the FreeRTOS demo and test applications for this device\. FreeRTOS supports versions 3\.13 and later\.

You can download the latest version of CMake from [ CMake\.org](https://cmake.org/download/)\. Source and binary distributions are available\.

For more details about using CMake with FreeRTOS, see [Using CMake with FreeRTOS](getting-started-cmake.md)\.

## Establish a serial connection<a name="esp32wroom-32se-establish-serial-connection"></a>

1. To establish a serial connection between your host machine and the ESP32\-WROOM\-32SE, install the CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP drivers\. You can download these drivers from [ Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)\.

1. Follow the steps to [ Establish a Serial Connection with ESP32](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html)\.

1. After you establish a serial connection, make a note of the serial port for your board's connection\. You need it when you build the demo\.

## Download and configure FreeRTOS<a name="download-and-configure-esp32wroom-32se"></a>

After you set up your environment, you can download FreeRTOS from [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos) or from the [FreeRTOS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/freertos)\. For instructions, see the [README\.md](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/master/README.md) file\.

**Important**  
The ATECC608A device has a one\-time initialization that is locked onto the device the first time a project is run \(during the call to `C_InitToken`\)\. However, the FreeRTOS demo project and test project have different configurations\. If the device is locked during the demo project configurations, not all tests in the test project will succeed\.

1. Configure the FreeRTOS Demo Project by following the steps in [Configuring the FreeRTOS demos](freertos-configure.md)\. Skip the last step **To format your AWS IoT credentials** and follow the steps below instead\.

1. Microchip has provided several scripting tools to help with the setup of the ATECC608A parts\. Navigate to the `freertos/vendors/microchip/secure_elements/app/example_trust_chain_tool` directory, and open the `README.md` file\.

   Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to provision your device\. The steps include:

   1. Create and register a certificate authority with AWS\.

   1. Generate your keys on the ATECC608A and export the public key and device serial number\.

   1. Generate a certificate for the device and register that certificate with AWS\.

1. Load the CA certificate and device certificate onto the device by following the instructions for [Developer\-mode key provisioning](dev-mode-key-provisioning.md)\.

## Build, flash, and run the FreeRTOS demo project<a name="build-and-run-example-esp32wroom-32se"></a>

You can use CMake to generate the build files, Make to build the application binary, and Espressif's IDF utility to flash your board\.

### Build FreeRTOS on Linux or MacOS<a name="build-esp32wroom-32se"></a>

If you're using Windows, you can skip to [Build FreeRTOS on Windows](#build-esp32wroom-32se-windows)\.

Use CMake to generate the build files, and then use Make to build the application\.

**To generate the demo application's build files with CMake**

1. Navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory\.

1. In a command line window, enter the following command to generate the build files\.

   ```
   cmake -DVENDOR=espressif -DBOARD=esp32_plus_ecc608a_devkitc -DCOMPILER=xtensa-esp32 -S . -B your-build-directory
   ```
**Note**  
To build the application for debugging, add the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` flag\.  
To generate the test application build files, add the `-DAFR_ENABLE_TESTS=1` flag\.  
The code provided by Espressif uses the lightweight IP \(lwIP\) stack as the default networking stack\. To use the FreeRTOS\+TCP networking stack instead, add the `â€“DAFR_ESP_FREERTOS_TCP` flag to the CMake command\.  
To add the lwIP dependency for non\-vendor provided code, add the following lines to the CMake dependency file, `CMakeLists.txt`, for your custom WiFi component\.  

   ```
   # Add a dependency on the bluetooth espressif component to the common component
   set(COMPONENT_REQUIRES lwip)
   ```

**To build the application with Make**

1. Navigate to the `build` directory\.

1. In a command line window, enter the following command to build the application with Make\.

   ```
   make all -j4
   ```
**Note**  
You must generate the build files with the cmake command every time you switch between the `aws_demos` project and the `aws_tests` project\.

### Build FreeRTOS on Windows<a name="build-esp32wroom-32se-windows"></a>

On Windows, you must specify a build generator for CMake\. Otherwise, CMake defaults to Visual Studio\. Espressif officially recommends the Ninja build system because it works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS\. You must run CMake commands in a native Windows environment like cmd or PowerShell\. Running CMake commands in a virtual Linux environment, such as MSYS2 or WSL, isn't supported\.

Use CMake to generate the build files, and then use Make to build the application\.

**To generate the demo application's build files with CMake**

1. Navigate to the root of your FreeRTOS download directory\.

1. In a command line window, enter the following command to generate the build files\.

   ```
   cmake -DVENDOR=espressif -DBOARD=esp32_plus_ecc608a_devkitc -DCOMPILER=xtensa-esp32 -GNinja -S . -B your-build-directory
   ```
**Note**  
To build the application for debugging, add the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` flag\.  
To generate the test application build files, add the `-DAFR_ENABLE_TESTS=1` flag\.  
The code provided by Espressif uses the lightweight IP \(lwIP\) stack as the default networking stack\. To use the FreeRTOS\+TCP networking stack instead, add the `â€“DAFR_ESP_FREERTOS_TCP` flag to the CMake command\.  
To add the lwIP dependency for non\-vendor provided code, add the following lines to the CMake dependency file, `CMakeLists.txt`, for your custom WiFi component\.  

   ```
   # Add a dependency on the bluetooth espressif component to the common component
   set(COMPONENT_REQUIRES lwip)
   ```

**To build the application**

1. Navigate to the `build` directory\.

1. In a command line window, enter the following command to invoke Ninja to build the application\.

   ```
   ninja
   ```

   Or, use the generic CMake interface to build the application\.

   ```
   cmake --build your-build-directory
   ```
**Note**  
You must generate the build files with the cmake command every time you switch between the `aws_demos` project and the `aws_tests` project\.

### Flash and run FreeRTOS<a name="flash-esp32wroom-32se"></a>

Use Espressif's IDF utility \(`freertos/vendors/espressif/esp-idf/tools/idf.py`\) to flash your board, run the application, and see logs\.

To erase the board's flash, navigate to the `freertos` directory and enter the following command\.

```
./vendors/espressif/esp-idf/tools/idf.py erase_flash -B build-directory
```

To flash the application binary to your board, use `make`\.

```
make flash
```

You can also use the IDF script to flash your board\.

```
./vendors/espressif/esp-idf/tools/idf.py flash -B build-directory
```

To monitor:

```
./vendors/espressif/esp-idf/tools/idf.py monitor -p /dev/ttyUSB1 -B build-directory
```

**Tip**  
You can also combine these commands\.  

```
./vendors/espressif/esp-idf/tools/idf.py erase_flash flash monitor -p /dev/ttyUSB1 -B build-directory
```

### Monitoring MQTT messages on the AWS Cloud<a name="gsg-esp32wroom-32se-monitor-mqtt"></a>

You can use the MQTT client in the AWS IoT console to monitor the messages that your device sends to the AWS Cloud\.

**To subscribe to the MQTT topic with the AWS IoT MQTT client**

1. Sign in to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Test** to open the MQTT client\.

1. In **Subscription topic**, enter **iotdemo/\#**, and then choose **Subscribe to topic**\.
