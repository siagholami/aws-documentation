# Download FreeRTOS with the OTA library<a name="ota-download-freertos"></a>

You can download FreeRTOS from the [FreeRTOS console](freertos-ocw.md), or you can clone or download FreeRTOS from [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos)\. See the [ README\.md](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/master/README.md) file for instructions\.

To include the OTA library in the FreeRTOS configuration that you download from the console, you can customize a predefined configuration, or you can create a configuration for a platform that supports OTA functionality\. On the **Configure FreeRTOS Software** configuration properties page, under **Libraries**, choose **OTA Updates**\. Under **Demo projects**, you can choose to enable the OTA demo\. You can also enable the demo manually later on\.

For information about setting up and running the OTA demo application, see [Over\-the\-air updates demo application](ota-demo.md)\.
