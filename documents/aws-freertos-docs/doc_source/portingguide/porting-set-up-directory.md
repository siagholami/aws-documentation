# Configuring the FreeRTOS download<a name="porting-set-up-directory"></a>

Follow the instructions below to configure the FreeRTOS download for porting FreeRTOS code to your device\.

## Configuring directories for vendor\-supplied, board\-specific libraries<a name="w3aab9c13b5"></a>

Under the download's root directory \(`freertos`\), the `vendors` folder is structured as follows:

```
vendors
+ - vendor    (Template, to be renamed to the name of the MCU vendor)
    + - boards    
    |   + - board    (Template, to be renamed to the name of the development board)
    |       + - aws_demos
    |       + - aws_tests
    |       + - CMakeLists.txt
    |       + - ports
    + - driver_library    (Template, to be renamed to the library name)
        + - driver_library_version    (Template, to be renamed to the library version)
```

The `vendor and ``board` folders are template folders that we provide to make it easier to create demo and test projects\. Their directory structure ensures that all demo and test projects have a consistent organization\.

The `aws_tests` folder has the following structure:

```
vendors/vendor/boards/board/aws_tests
+ - application_code    (Contains main.c, which contains main())
|   + - vendor_code    (Contains vendor-supplied, board-specific files)
|   + - main.c    (Contains main())
+ - config_files    (Contains FreeRTOS config files)
```

All test projects require vendor\-supplied driver libraries\. Some vendor\-supplied files, such as a header file that maps GPIO output to an LED light, are specific to a target development board\. These files belong in the `vendor_code` folder\.

Other vendor\-supplied files, such as a GPIO library, are common across a board's MCU family\. These files belong in the *driver\_library* folder\.

**To set up the directories for vendor\-supplied libraries that are common across an MCU family**

1. Save all required vendor\-supplied libraries that are common across a target board's MCU family in the `driver_library_version` folder\.

1. Rename the `vendor` folder to the name of the vendor, and rename the `driver_library` and `driver_library_version` folders to the name of the driver library and its version\.

**Important**  
Do not save vendor\-supplied libraries that are common across a target board's MCU family to any subdirectories of `freertos/test` or `freertos/demos`\.

## Configuring directories for project files<a name="w3aab9c13b7"></a>

Under `freertos`, the `projects` folder is structured as follows:

```
projects
+ - vendor    (Template, to be renamed to the name of the MCU vendor)
    + - board    (Template, to be renamed to the name of the development board)
        + - ide    (Contains an IDE-specific project)
        + - visual_studio    (contains project files for Visual Studio)
```

**To set up the project directories**

1. Rename the `ide` folder to the name of the IDE that you are using to build the test project\.

1. Rename the `vendor` folder to the name of the vendor, and rename the `board` folder to the name of the development board\.

## Configuring `FreeRTOSConfig.h`<a name="w3aab9c13b9"></a>

After you have configured the directory structure of your FreeRTOS download, configure your board name in the `FreeRTOSConfig.h` configuration header file\.

**To configure your board name in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`**

1. Open `freertos/vendors/vendor/boards/board/aws_tests/config_files/FreeRTOSConfig.h`\.

1. In the line `#define configPLATFORM_NAME "Unknown"`, change *Unknown* to match the name of your board\.
