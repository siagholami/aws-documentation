Configuring a CloudWatch Events rule for automatically sent findings
You can create a rule in CloudWatch Events that defines an action to take when a Security Hub Findings - Imported event is received. A Security Hub Findings - Imported events are triggered by updates from both https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html.
To create a CloudWatch Events rule for a Security Hub finding


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Rules.


Choose Create rule.


For Event source, confirm that Event Pattern is selected.


Choose Edit for Event Pattern Preview.


Copy the following example pattern and paste it into the preview window. Be sure to replace the existing brackets.


{
     "source": [
       "aws.securityhub"
     ],
     "detail-type": [
       "Security Hub Findings - Imported"
     ]
   }


Choose Save to close the window.


Choose Add target, then select the target to invoke when this rule is matched.


You might need to configure the settings for the selected target.
