Responding to an invitation to be a member account
You can accept or decline an invitation to be a member account.
After you accept an invitation, your account becomes an AWS Security Hub member account. The account that sent the invitation becomes your Security Hub master account. The master account user can view findings for your member account in Security Hub.
If you decline the invitation, then your account is marked as Resigned on the master account's list of member accounts.
You can only accept one invitation to be a member account.
Before you can accept or decline an invitation, you must enable Security Hub. For information on how to enable Security Hub, see Enabling Security Hub.
