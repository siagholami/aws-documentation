PCI DSS controls
The PCI DSS security standard in Security Hub supports the following controls. For each control, the information includes the severity, the resource type, the AWS Config rule, and the remediation steps.
[PCI.AutoScaling.1] Auto Scaling groups associated with a load balancer should use health checks
Severity: Low
Resource: Auto Scaling group
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/autoscaling-group-elb-healthcheck-required.html
Parameters: None
This control checks whether your Auto Scaling groups that are associated with a load balancer are using Elastic Load Balancing health checks.
PCI DSS does not require load balancing or highly available configurations. However, this check aligns with AWS best practices.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 2.2: Develop configuration standards for all system components. Assure that these standards address all known security vulnerabilities and are consistent with industry-accepted system hardening standards.
Replicating systems using load balancing provides high availability and is a means to mitigate the effects of a DDoS event.
This is one method used to implement system hardening configurations.
Remediation
To enable Elastic Load Balancing health checks


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under Auto Scaling, choose Auto Scaling Groups.


To select the group from the list, choose the right box.


From Actions, choose Edit


For Health Check Type, choose ELB.


For Health Check Grace Period, enter 300.


Choose Save.


For more information on using a load balancer with an Auto Scaling group, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-load-balancer.html.
[PCI.CloudTrail.1] CloudTrail logs should be encrypted at rest using AWS KMS CMKs
Severity: Medium
Resource: CloudTrail trail
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/cloud-trail-encryption-enabled.html
Parameters: None
This control checks whether AWS CloudTrail is configured to use the server-side encryption (SSE) AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) encryption.
If you are only using the default encryption option, you can choose to disable this check.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 3.4: Render Primary Account Numbers (PAN) unreadable anywhere it is stored (including on portable digital media, backup media, and in logs).
If you are using AWS services to process and store PAN, your CloudTrail logs should be encrypted at rest. Encrypting logs ensures that if logs capture PAN(s), the PAN(s) are protected.
By default, the log files delivered by CloudTrail to your S3 bucket are encrypted using Amazon server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). See the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html.
You can configure CloudTrail logs to leverage AWS KMS customer-created master keys (CMKs) to further protect CloudTrail logs.
These are methods used to render PAN unreadable.
Remediation
To enable encryption for CloudTrail logs


Open the CloudTrail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/.


Choose Trails.


Choose the trail to update.


Under Storage location, to edit the settings, choose the pencil icon.


For Encrypt log files with SSE-KMS, choose Yes.


For Create a new KMS key, do one of the following: 
    To create a key, choose Yes and then in KMS key, enter an alias for the key. The key is created in the same Region as the S3 bucket.
    To use an existing key, choose No and then from KMS key, select the key. 
The AWS KMS key and S3 bucket must be in the same Region.


Choose Save.


You might need to modify the policy for CloudTrail to successfully interact with your CMK. For more information on encrypting CloudTrail log files with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS), see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/encrypting-cloudtrail-log-files-with-aws-kms.html?icmpid=docs_cloudtrail_console.
[PCI.CloudTrail.2] CloudTrail should be enabled
Severity: High
Resource: Account
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/cloudtrail-enabled.html
Parameters: None
This control checks whether CloudTrail is enabled in your AWS account.
However, some AWS services do not enable logging of all APIs and events. You should implement any additional audit trails other than CloudTrail and review the documentation for each service in CloudTrail Supported Services and Integrations.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is associated with the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 10.1: Implement audit trails to link all access to system components to each individual user.
By enabling CloudTrail, Event History provides you with 90 days of readily available events and audit trails for access to system components by each individual user.
You can find the identity of the users in the eventSource section of the CloudTrail log.
PCI DSS 10.2.1: Implement automated audit trails for all system components to reconstruct the following events: All individual user accesses to cardholder data
Depending on where cardholder data is stored, individual user accesses to cardholder data could be found in the userIdentity, eventSource, eventName, or responseElements sections of the CloudTrail log.
PCI DSS 10.2.2: Implement automated audit trails for all system components to reconstruct the following events: All actions taken by any individual with root or administrative privileges
Root user identification is found in the userIdentity section of the log.
PCI DSS 10.2.3: Implement automated audit trails for all system components to reconstruct the following events: Access to all audit trails
Access to audit trails might be found in the eventSource, eventName, or responseElements sections of the log.
PCI DSS 10.2.4: Implement automated audit trails for all system components to reconstruct the following events: Invalid logical access attempts
You can find invalid logical access attempts in CloudTrail logs. For example: responseElements : "ConsoleLogin" and responseElements : "Failure".
PCI DSS 10.2.5: Implement automated audit trails for all system components to reconstruct the following events: Use of and changes to identification and authentication mechanisms—including but not limited to creation of new accounts and elevation of privileges—and all changes, additions, or deletions to accounts with root or administrative privileges
Use of and changes to identification and authentication mechanisms might be found in the userAgent, eventName, or responseElements sections of the log.
PCI DSS 10.2.6: Implement automated audit trails for all system components to reconstruct the following events: Initialization, stopping, or pausing of the audit logs
Starting and stopping logging is captured in the CloudTrail logs.
An example of audit log starting and stopping would look as follows within a CloudTrail Log: eventName : "StopLogging" and eventName : "StartLogging"
PCI DSS 10.2.7: Implement automated audit trails for all system components to reconstruct the following events: Creation and deletion of system-level objects
Creation and deletion of system level-objects are captured in the CloudTrail logs. An example of a system-level object would be an AWS Lambda function.
CloudTrail captures the createFunction and deleteFunction API calls, as described in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/logging-using-cloudtrail.html.
PCI DSS 10.3.1: Record at least the following audit trail entries for all system components for each event: User identification
You can find user identification in the userIdentity section of the CloudTrail logs.
PCI DSS 10.3.2: Record at least the following audit trail entries for all system components for each event: Type of event
You can find the type of event in the eventName section of the CloudTrail log.
PCI DSS 10.3.3: Record at least the following audit trail entries for all system components for each event: Date and time
You can find the date and time of an event in the eventTime section of the CloudTrail log.
PCI DSS 10.3.4: Record at least the following audit trail entries for all system components for each event: Success or failure indication
You can find the success or failure indication in the responseElements section of the CloudTrail log.
PCI DSS 10.3.5: Record at least the following audit trail entries for all system components for each event: Origination of event
You can find the origination of an event in the userAgent or sourceIPAddress section of the CloudTrail log.
PCI DSS 10.3.6: Record at least the following audit trail entries for all system components for each event: Identity or name of affected data, system component, or resource.
You can find the identity of the resource in the eventSource section of the CloudTrail log.
Remediation
To create a new trail in CloudTrail


Sign in to the AWS Management Console using the IAM user you configured for CloudTrail administration.


Open the CloudTrail console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/.


In the Region selector, choose the AWS Region where you want your trail to be created. This is the Home Region for the trail. 


The Home Region is the only AWS Region where you can view and update the trail after it is created, even if the trail logs events in all AWS Regions. 


In the navigation pane, choose Trails.


On the Trails page, choose Get Started Now. If you do not see that option, choose Create Trail. 


In Trail name, give your trail a name, such as My-Management-Events-Trail.


As a best practice, use a name that quickly identifies the purpose of the trail. In this case, you're creating a trail that logs management events.


For Apply trail to all regions, keep the default Yes.


In Management Events, make sure Read/Write events is set to All.


In Data Events, do not make any changes. This trail will not log any data events. 


Create a new S3 bucket for the logs:


In Storage Location, in Create a new S3 bucket, choose Yes.


In S3 bucket, give your bucket a name, such as my-bucket-for-storing-cloudtrail-logs.
The name of your S3 bucket must be globally unique. For more information about S3 bucket naming requirements, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-s3-bucket-naming-requirements.html.


Under Advanced, choose Yes for both Encrypt log files with SSE-KMS and Enable log file validation.

[PCI.Config.1] AWS Config should be enabled
Severity:  Medium
Resource: Account
AWS Config rule: None. To run this check, Security Hub runs through audit steps prescribed for it in Securing Amazon Web Services. No AWS Config managed rules are created in your AWS environment for this check.
Parameters: None
This control checks whether AWS Config is enabled in the account for the local Region and is recording all resources.
It does not check for change detection for all critical system files and content files, as AWS Config supports only a subset of resource types.
The AWS Config service performs configuration management of supported AWS resources in your account and delivers log files to you. The recorded information includes the configuration item (AWS resource), relationships between configuration items, and any configuration changes between resources. 
Security Hub recommends that you enable AWS Config in all Regions. The AWS configuration item history that AWS Config captures enables security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing. 
Note
Because Security Hub is a Regional service, the check performed for this control checks only the current Region for the account. It does not check all Regions. 
To allow security checks against global resources in each Region, you also must record global resources. If you only record global resources in a single Region, then you can disable this control in all Regions except the Region where you record global resources.
For more information, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 10.5.2: Protect audit trail files from unauthorized modifications.

AWS Config rule: Security Hub runs through audit steps without creating an AWS Config managed rules in your AWS account for this check. 
Parameters: None
This control checks for the CloudWatch metric filters using the following pattern:
{ $.userIdentity.type = "Root" && $.userIdentity.invokedBy NOT EXISTS && $.eventType != "AwsServiceEvent" }
It checks the following:
 The log group name is configured for use with active multi-Region CloudTrail.
 There is at least one Event Selector for a Trail with IncludeManagementEvents set to true and ReadWriteType set to All.
 There is at least one active subscriber to an Amazon SNS topic associated with the alarm.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 7.2.1: Establish an access control system(s) for systems components that restricts access based on a user’s need to know, and is set to "deny all" unless specifically allowed. This access control system(s) must include the following: Coverage of all system components.
The root user is the most privileged user in an AWS account and has unrestricted access to all resources in the AWS account.
You should set up log metric filters and alarms in the event that AWS account root user credentials are used.
You should also ensure that CloudTrail is enabled to keep an audit trail of actions taken by any individual with root or administrative privileges (see [PCI.CloudTrail.2] CloudTrail should be enabled). Root user identification would be found in the userIdentity section of the CloudTrail log.
Remediation
The steps to remediate this issue include setting up an Amazon SNS topic, a metric filter, and an alarm for the metric filter.
These are the same steps to remediate findings for 3.3 – Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for usage of "root" account .

AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dms-replication-not-public.html
Parameters: None
This control checks whether AWS DMS replication instances are public. To do this, it examines the value of the PubliclyAccessible field.
A private replication instance has a private IP address that you cannot access outside of the replication network. A replication instance should have a private IP address when the source and target databases are in the same network, and the network is connected to the replication instance's VPC using a VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering. To learn more about public and private replication instances, see Public and private replication instances in the AWS Database Migration Service User Guide.
You should also ensure that access to your AWS DMS instance configuration is limited to only authorized users. To do this, restrict users’ IAM permissions to modify AWS DMS settings and resources.
Note
This control is not supported in Africa (Cape Town) or Europe (Milan).
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements.
PCI DSS 1.2.1 - Restrict inbound and outbound traffic to that which is necessary for the cardholder data environment (CDE), and specifically deny all other traffic.
If you use AWS DMS in your defined CDE, set the replication instance’s PubliclyAccessible field to 'false'. Allowing public access to your replication instance might violate the requirement to allow only necessary traffic to and from the CDE.
PCI DSS 1.3.1 - Implement a DMZ to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.
If you use AWS DMS in your defined CDE, set the replication instance’s PubliclyAccessible field to 'false'.

[PCI.EC2.2] VPC default security group should prohibit inbound and outbound traffic
Severity: Medium
Resource: Amazon EC2 security group
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-default-security-group-closed.html
Parameters: None
This control checks that the default security group of a VPC does not allow inbound or outbound traffic.
It does not check for access restrictions for other security groups that are not default, and other VPC configurations.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 1.2.1: Restrict inbound and outbound traffic to that which is necessary for the cardholder data environment (CDE), and specifically deny all other traffic.
If a service that is in scope for PCI DSS is associated with the default security group, the default rules for the security group will allow all outbound traffic. The rules also allow all inbound traffic from network interfaces (and their associated instances) that are assigned to the same security group.
You should change the default security group rules setting to restrict inbound and outbound traffic. Using the default might violate the requirement to allow only necessary traffic to and from the CDE.
PCI DSS 1.3.4: Do not allow unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the internet.
If a service that is in scope for PCI DSS is associated with the default security group, the default rules for the security group will allow all outbound traffic. The rules also allow all inbound traffic from network interfaces (and their associated instances) that are assigned to the same security group.
You should change the default security group rules setting to restrict unauthorized inbound and outbound traffic. Using the default may violate the requirement to block unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the internet.
PCI DSS 2.1: Always change vendor-supplied defaults and remove or disable unnecessary default accounts before installing a system on the network.
If a service that is in scope for PCI DSS is associated with the default security group, the default rules for the security group will allow all outbound traffic. The rules also allow all inbound traffic from network interfaces (and their associated instances) that are assigned to the same security group.
You should change the default security group rules setting to restrict inbound and outbound traffic. Using the default may violate the requirement to remove or disable unnecessary default accounts.
Remediation
To remediate this issue, create new security groups and assign those security groups to your resources. To prevent the default security groups from being used, remove their inbound and outbound rules.
To create new security groups and assign them to your resources


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Security groups. View the default security groups details to see the resources that are assigned to them.


Create a set of least-privilege security groups for the resources. For details on how to create security groups, see Creating a security group in the Amazon VPC User Guide.


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the Amazon EC2 console, change the security group for the resources that use the default security groups to the least-privilege security group you created. See Changing an instance's security groups in the Amazon VPC User Guide.


After you assign the new security groups to the resources, remove the inbound and outbound rules from the default security groups. This ensures that the default security groups are not used.
To remove the rules from the default security group


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Security groups.


Select a default security group, and choose the Inbound rules tab. Choose Edit inbound rules. Then delete all of the inbound rules. Choose Save rules.


Repeat the previous step for each default security group.


Select a default security group and choose the Outbound rules tab. Choose Edit outbound rules. Then delete all of the outbound rules. Choose Save rules.


Repeat the previous step for each default security group.

Severity: High
Resource: EC2 security group
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/restricted-ssh.html
Parameters: None
This control checks whether security groups in use disallow unrestricted incoming SSH traffic. 
It does not evaluate outbound traffic. 
Note that security groups are stateful. If you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of inbound security group rules. Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out regardless of outbound rules. To learn more about security groups, see Security groups for your VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Note
This control is not supported in Africa (Cape Town) or Europe (Milan).
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 1.2.1 - Restrict inbound and outbound traffic to that which is necessary for the cardholder data environment (CDE), and specifically deny all other traffic.
You might allow SSH traffic to your instances that are in your defined CDE. If so, restrict the inbound SSH source from 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere) to a specific IP address or range. Leaving unrestricted access to SSH might violate the requirement to allow only necessary traffic to and from the CDE.
PCI DSS 1.3.1 - Implement a DMZ to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.
You might allow SSH traffic to your instances that are in your defined CDE. If so, restrict the inbound SSH source from 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere) to a specific IP address or range. Leaving unrestricted access to SSH might violate the requirement to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.
PCI DSS 2.2.2 Enable only necessary services, protocols, daemons, etc., as required for the function of the system.
You might allow SSH traffic to your instances that are in your defined CDE. If so, restrict the inbound SSH source from 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere) to a specific IP address or range as required for the function of the security group. Within a CDE, a security group could be considered a system component, which should be hardened appropriately. Leaving unrestricted access to SSH might violate the requirement to enable only the necessary services, protocols, daemons, etc., that are required for the function of the system.
Remediation
Perform the following steps for each security group associated with a VPC.
To remove access to port 22 from a security group


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

[PCI.EC2.6] VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs
Severity: Medium
Resource: EC2 VPC
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-flow-logs-enabled.html
Parameters: 
 trafficType – REJECT
This control checks whether VPC flow logs are found and enabled for VPCs. The traffic type is set to REJECT.
With VPC Flow Logs, you can capture information about the IP address traffic to and from network interfaces in your VPC. After you create a flow log, you can use CloudWatch Logs to view and retrieve the log data.
Security Hub recommends that you enable flow logging for packet rejects for VPCs. Flow logs provide visibility into network traffic that traverses the VPC. They can detect anomalous traffic and provide insight into security workflows.
By default, the record includes values for the different components of the IP address flow, including the source, destination, and protocol. For more information and descriptions of the log fields, see VPC Flow Logs in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements.
PCI DSS 10.3.3 Verify date and time stamp is included in log entries.
By enabling VPC flow logging for your VPC, you can identify the date and time of a log entry. The event date and time are recorded in the start and end fields. The values are displayed in Unix seconds.
PCI DSS 10.3.4 Verify success or failure indication is included in log entries.
By enabling VPC flow logging for your VPC, you can identify the type of event that occurred. The type of event is recorded in the action field, and can be either ACCEPT or REJECT.
PCI DSS 10.3.5 Verify origination of event is included in log entries.
By enabling VPC flow logging for your VPC, you can verify the origin of an event. The event origin is recorded in the pkt-srcaddr, srcaddr, and srcport fields. These fields show the source IP address and source port of the traffic. 
PCI DSS 10.3.6 Verify identity or name of affected data, system component, or resources is included in log entries.
By enabling VPC flow logging for your VPC, you can verify the identity or name of affected data, system components, or resources. The pkt-dstaddr, dstaddr, and dstport fields show the destination IP address and destination port of the traffic.

[PCI.ELBV2.1] Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
Severity: Medium
Resource: AwsElbv2LoadBalancer
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/alb-http-to-https-redirection-check.html 
Parameters: None
This control checks whether HTTP to HTTPS redirection is configured on all HTTP listeners of Application Load Balancers. The control fails if any of the HTTP listeners of Application Load Balancers do not have HTTP to HTTPS redirection configured.
Before you start to use your Application Load Balancer, you must add one or more listeners. A listener is a process that uses the configured protocol and port to check for connection requests. Listeners support both the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. You can use an HTTPS listener to offload the work of encryption and decryption to your load balancer. To enforce encryption in transit, you should use redirect actions with Application Load Balancers to redirect client HTTP requests to an HTTPS request on port 443.
To learn more, see Listeners for your Application Load Balancers in User Guide for Application Load Balancers.
Note
This control is not supported in Africa (Cape Town) or Europe (Milan).
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 2.3 Encrypt all nonconsole administrative access using strong cryptography.
If you use Application Load Balancers with an HTTP listener, ensure that the listener is redirected to HTTPS for any nonconsole administrative access. Allowing unencrypted authentication over HTTP for administrators of the cardholder data environment might violate the requirement to encrypt all nonconsole administrative access using strong cryptography.
PCI DSS 4.1 Use strong cryptography and security protocols to safeguard sensitive cardholder data during transmission over open, public networks.
If you use Application Load Balancers with an HTTP listener, ensure that the listener is redirected to HTTPS for any transmissions of cardholder data. Allowing unencrypted transmissions of cardholder data might violate the requirement to use strong cryptography and security protocols to safeguard sensitive cardholder data during transmission over open, public networks.
Remediation
To remediate this issue, you redirect HTTP request to HTTPS.

[PCI.ES.1] Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains should be in a VPC
Severity:  Critical
Resource:  Amazon ES domain 
AWS Config rule:  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/elasticsearch-in-vpc-only.html
Parameters: None
This control checks whether Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains are in a VPC.
It does not evaluate the VPC subnet routing configuration to determine public reachability.
This AWS control also does not check whether the Amazon ES resource-based policy permits public access by other accounts or external entities. You should ensure that Amazon ES domains are not attached to public subnets. See Resource-based policies in the Amazon Elasticsearch Service Developer Guide.
You should also ensure that your VPC is configured according to the recommended best practices. See Security best practices for your VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 1.2.1: Restrict inbound and outbound traffic to that which is necessary for the cardholder data environment (CDE), and specifically deny all other traffic.
If your Amazon ES clusters contain cardholder data, the Amazon ES domains should be placed in a VPC. Doing so enables secure communication between Amazon ES and other services within the VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection port.
This method is used to allow only necessary traffic to and from the CDE.
PCI DSS 1.3.1: Implement a DMZ to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.
If your Amazon ES clusters contain cardholder data, the Amazon ES domains should be placed in a VPC. Doing so enables secure communication between Amazon ES and other services within the VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection port.
This method is used to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.
PCI DSS 1.3.2: Limit inbound internet traffic to IP addresses within the DMZ.
If your Amazon ES clusters contain cardholder data, the Amazon ES domains should be placed in a VPC, which enables secure communication between Amazon ES and other services within the VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection port.
This method is used to limit inbound internet traffic to IP addresses within the DMZ.
You can also use a resource-based policy and specify an IP condition for restricting access based on source IP addresses. See the blog post How to control access to your Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain.
PCI DSS 1.3.4: Do not allow unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the internet.
If your Amazon ES clusters contain cardholder data, the Amazon ES domains should be placed in a VPC, which enables secure communication between Amazon ES and other services within the VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection port.
This method is used to block unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the internet.
PCI DSS 1.3.6: Place system components that store cardholder data (such as a database) in an internal network zone, segregated from the DMZ and other untrusted networks.
If your Amazon ES clusters contain cardholder data, the Amazon ES domains should be placed in a VPC. Doing so enables secure communication between Amazon ES and other services within the VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection port.
This method is used to place system components that store cardholder data in an internal network zone, segregated from the DMZ and other untrusted networks.
Remediation
If you create a domain with a public endpoint, you cannot later place it within a VPC. Instead, you must create a new domain and migrate your data.
The reverse is also true. If you create a domain within a VPC, it cannot have a public endpoint. Instead, you must either create another domain or disable this control.
See the information on migrating from public access to VPC access in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-vpc.html#es-migrating-public-to-vpc.
[PCI.ES.2] Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains should have encryption at rest enabled
Severity: Medium
Resource: Amazon ES domain
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/elasticsearch-encrypted-at-rest.html
Parameters: None
This control checks whether Amazon ES domains have encryption at rest configuration enabled.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 3.4: Render Primary Account Numbers (PAN) unreadable anywhere it is stored (including on portable digital media, backup media, and in logs).
If you use Amazon ES to store credit card Primary Account Numbers (PAN), the PAN should be protected by enabling Amazon ES domain encryption at rest.
If enabled, it encrypts the following aspects of a domain: Indices, automated snapshots, Amazon ES logs, swap files, all other data in the application directory.
This is a method used to render PAN unreadable.
Remediation
By default, domains do not encrypt data at rest, and you cannot configure existing domains to use the feature.
To enable the feature, you must create another domain and migrate your data. For information about creating domains, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-createupdatedomains.html#es-createdomains.
Encryption of data at rest requires Amazon ES 5.1 or later. For more information about encrypting data at rest for Amazon ES, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/encryption-at-rest.html.

Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 11.4 Use intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques to detect and/or prevent intrusions into the network. 
GuardDuty can help to meet requirement 11.4 by monitoring traffic at the perimeter of the cardholder data environment and all critical points within it. It can also keep all intrusion-detection engines, baselines, and signatures up to date. Findings are generated from GuardDuty. You can send these alerts to personnel using Amazon CloudWatch. See Creating custom responses to GuardDuty findings with Amazon CloudWatch Events in the Amazon GuardDuty User Guide. Not enabling GuardDuty in your AWS account might violate the requirement to use intrusion-detection and/or prevention techniques to prevent intrusions into the network.
Remediation
To remediate this issue, you enable GuardDuty.
To enable GuardDuty


Open the GuardDuty console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/.


Choose Get Started.

Parameters: None
This control checks whether user access keys exist for the root user.
Note
This control is not supported in Africa (Cape Town).
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 2.1: Always change vendor-supplied defaults and remove or disable unnecessary default accounts before installing a system on the network.
The AWS account root user is the most privileged AWS user. AWS access keys provide programmatic access to a given account.
No access keys should be created for the root user, as this may violate the requirement to remove or disable unnecessary default accounts.
PCI DSS 2.2: Develop configuration standards for all system components. Assure that these standards address all known security vulnerabilities and are consistent with industry-accepted system hardening standards.
The root user is the most privileged AWS user. AWS access keys provide programmatic access to a given account.
No access keys should be created for the root user, as this may violate the requirement to implement system hardening configurations.
PCI DSS 7.2.1: Establish an access control system(s) for systems components that restricts access based on a user’s need to know, and is set to "deny all" unless specifically allowed. This access control system(s) must include the following: Coverage of all system components.
The root user is the most privileged AWS user. AWS access keys provide programmatic access to a given account.
No access keys should be created for the root user. Doing so might violate the requirement to ensure access to systems components is restricted to least privilege necessary, or a user’s need to know.
Remediation
To deactivate or delete access keys


Log in to your account using the root user credentials.


Choose the account name near the top-right corner of the page and then choose My Security Credentials. 


In the pop-up warning, choose Continue to Security Credentials.

[PCI.IAM.2] IAM users should not have IAM policies attached
Severity: Low
Resource: IAM user
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-user-no-policies-check.html
Parameters: None
This control checks that none of your IAM users have policies attached. IAM users must inherit permissions from IAM groups or roles.
It does not check whether least privileged policies are applied to IAM roles and groups.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 7.2.1: Establish an access control system(s) for systems components that restricts access based on a user’s need to know, and is set to "deny all" unless specifically allowed. This access control system(s) must include the following: Coverage of all system components.
IAM policies are how privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles in AWS.
By default, IAM users, groups, and roles have no access to AWS resources until IAM policies are attached to them.
To manage least privileged access and reduce the complexity of access management for PCI DSS in-scope resources, you should assign IAM polices at the group or role level and not at the user level.
Reducing access management complexity reduces opportunity for a principal to inadvertently receive or retain excessive privileges.
This is a method used to ensure access to systems components that contain cardholder data is restricted to least privilege necessary, or a user’s need to know.
Remediation
To resolve this issue, do the following:


Create an IAM group


Assign the policy to the group


Add the users to the group


The policy is applied to each user in the group. 
To create an IAM group


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


Choose Groups and then choose Create New Group.


Enter a name for the group to create and then choose Next Step.


Select each policy to assign to the group and then choose Next Step.


The policies that you choose should include any policies currently attached directly to a user account. The next step to resolve a failed check is to add users to a group and then assign the policies to that group.
Each user in the group gets assigned the policies assigned to the group. 

Confirm the details on the Review page and then choose Create Group. 

For more information about creating IAM groups, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_create.html.
To add users to an IAM group

[PCI.IAM.7] IAM user credentials should be disabled if not used within a predefined number of days
Severity: Medium
Resource: IAM User
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-user-unused-credentials-check.html
Parameters: 
 maxCredentialUsageAge: 90 (days)
This control checks whether your IAM users have passwords or active access keys that have not been used within a specified number of days. The default is 90 days. 
Security Hub strongly recommends that you do not generate and remove all access keys in your account. Instead, the recommended best practice is to either create one or more IAM roles or to use federation. These practices allow your users to use their existing corporate credentials to sign in to the AWS Management Console console and AWS CLI.
Each approach has its use cases. Federation is generally better for enterprises that have an existing central directory or who plan to need more than the current quota of IAM users. Applications running outside of an AWS environment need access keys for programmatic access to AWS resources.
However, if the resources that need programmatic access run inside AWS, the best practice is to use IAM roles. You can use roles to grant a resource access without hardcoding an access key ID and secret access key into the configuration.
To learn more about protecting your access keys and account, see Best practices for managing AWS access keys in the AWS General Reference. Also see the blog post Guidelines for protecting your AWS account while using-programmatic access.
If you already have an access key, we recommend that you remove or deactivate unused user credentials that are inactive for 90 days or longer.
This control only checks for inactive passwords or active access keys. It does not disable the account from use after 90 days. Customers are responsible for taking action and disabling the unused credentials.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements.
PCI DSS 8.1.4 Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
If you use IAM passwords or access keys, ensure that they are monitored for use, and disabled if not used for 90 days. Allowing IAM user accounts to remain active with unused credentials might violate the requirement to remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
Remediation
To get some of the information that you need to monitor accounts for dated credentials, use the IAM console. For example, when you view users in your account, there are columns for Access key age, Password age, and Last activity. If the value in any of these columns is greater than 90 days, make the credentials for those users inactive.
You can also use credential reports to monitor user accounts and identify those with no activity for 90 or more days. You can download credential reports in .csv format from the IAM console. For more information about credential reports, see Getting credential reports for your AWS account in the IAM User Guide.
After you identify the inactive accounts or unused credentials, use the following steps to disable them.
To disable inactive accounts or unused IAM credentials


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


Under Access management, choose Users.


Choose the name of the user that has credentials older than 90 days.


Choose Security credentials. Choose Make inactive for all sign-in credentials and access keys that were not used in 90 days or more.


[PCI.IAM.8] Password policies for IAM users should have strong configurations
Severity: Medium
Resource: AWS Account
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-password-policy.html
Parameters: None
This control checks whether the account password policy for IAM users uses the following minimum PCI DSS configurations.
 RequireUppercaseCharacters – Require at least one uppercase character in password. (Default = true)
 RequireLowercaseCharacters – Require at least one lowercase character in password. (Default = true)
 RequireNumbers – Require at least one number in password. (Default = true)
 MinimumPasswordLength – Password minimum length. (Default = 7 or longer)
 PasswordReusePrevention – Number of passwords before allowing reuse. (Default = 4)
 MaxPasswordAge – Number of days before password expiration. (Default = 90)
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements.
PCI DSS 8.1.4: Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days.
If you have IAM users in your AWS account, you should configure the IAM password policy appropriately. Not securing IAM users' passwords might violate the requirement to remove or disable inactive user accounts within 90 days. By default, the MaxPasswordAge parameter is set to 90 days. After their password expires, IAM users cannot access their account until the password is changed, which disables the user.
PCI DSS 8.2.3: Passwords/passphrases must meet the following: Require a minimum length of at least seven characters and Contain both numeric and alphabetic characters.
If you have IAM users in your AWS account, the IAM password policy should be configured appropriately. Not securing IAM users' passwords might violate the requirement for a password to have a minimum length of at least seven characters. It might also violate the requirements to contain both numeric and alphabetic characters. By default, MinimumPasswordLength is 7, RequireUppercaseCharacters is true, and RequireLowercaseCharacters is true.
PCI DSS 8.2.4: Change user passwords/passphrases at least once every 90 days.
If you have IAM users in your AWS account, the IAM password policy should be configured appropriately. Not securing IAM users' passwords might violate the requirement to change user passwords or passphrases at least once every 90 days. By default, the MaxPasswordAge parameter is set to 90 days. After the password expires, the IAM user cannot access the account until the password is changed.
PCI DSS 8.2.5: Do not allow an individual to submit a new password/passphrase that is the same as any of the last four passwords/passphrases he or she has used.
If you have IAM users in your AWS account, the IAM password policy should be configured appropriately. Not securing IAM users' passwords might violate the requirement to not allow individuals to submit a new password or passphrase that is the same as any of their previous four passwords or passphrases. By default, PasswordReusePrevention is set to 4, which prevents users from reusing their last four passwords.
Remediation
You can use the IAM console to modify the password policy.
To modify the password policy


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


Under Access management, choose Account settings.


Select Prevent password reuse. For Number of passwords to remember, enter 24.


Choose Change password policy.


Select Require at least one uppercase letter from Latin alphabet (A-Z).


Select Require at least one lowercase letter from Latin alphabet (a-z).

Severity: Medium
Resource:  AWS KMS key 
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/cmk-backing-key-rotation-enabled.html
Parameters: None
This control checks that key rotation is enabled for each customer master key (CMK). It does not check CMKs that have imported key material.
You should ensure keys that have imported material and those that are not stored in AWS KMS are rotated. AWS managed customer master keys are rotated once every 3 years.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 3.6.4: Cryptographic keys should be changed once they have reached the end of their cryptoperiod.
While PCI DSS does not specify the time frame for cryptoperiods, if key rotation is enabled, rotation occurs annually by default.
If you use customer master key (CMK) to encrypt cardholder data, you should enable key rotation.
This is a method used to change cryptographic keys once they have reached the end of their cryptoperiod.
Remediation
To enable CMK rotation


Open the AWS KMS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.


To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.

Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 1.2.1: Restrict inbound and outbound traffic to that which is necessary for the cardholder data environment (CDE), and specifically deny all other traffic.
If you use a Lambda function that is in scope for PCI DSS, the function should not be publicly accessible. A publicly accessible function might violate the requirement to allow only necessary traffic to and from the CDE.
PCI DSS 1.3.1: Implement a DMZ to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.
If you use a Lambda function that is in scope for PCI DSS, the function should not be publicly accessible. A publicly accessible function might violate the requirement to limit inbound traffic to only system components that provide authorized publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports.
PCI DSS 1.3.2: Limit inbound internet traffic to IP addresses within the DMZ.
If you use a Lambda function that is in scope for PCI DSS, the function should not be publicly accessible. A publicly accessible function might violate the requirement to limit inbound internet traffic to IP addresses within the DMZ.
PCI DSS 1.3.4: Do not allow unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the internet.
If you use a Lambda function that is in scope for PCI DSS, the function must not be publicly accessible. A publicly accessible function might violate the requirement to block unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the internet.
PCI DSS 7.2.1: Establish an access control system(s) for systems components that restricts access based on a user’s need to know, and is set to "deny all" unless specifically allowed. This access control system(s) must include the following: Coverage of all system components.
If you use a Lambda function that is in scope for PCI DSS, the function should not be publicly accessible. A publicly accessible function might violate the requirement to ensure access to systems components that contain cardholder data is restricted to the least privilege necessary, or a user’s need to know.
Remediation
To remediate this issue, you update the resource-based policy to change the publicly accessible Lambda function to a private Lambda function.
You can only update resource-based policies for Lambda resources within the scope of the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_AddPermission.html and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_AddLayerVersionPermission.html API actions.
You cannot author policies for your Lambda resources in JSON, or use conditions that don't map to parameters for those actions using the CLI or the SDK.
To use the AWS CLI to revoke function-use permission from an AWS service or another account

To get the ID of the statement from the output of GetPolicy, from the AWS CLI, run the following:

aws lambda get-policy —function-name yourfunctionname
This command returns the Lambda resource-based policy string associated with the publicly accessible Lambda function.


From the policy statement returned by the get-policy command, copy the string value of the Sid field.


From the AWS CLI, run


aws lambda remove-permission --function-name yourfunctionname —statement-id youridvalue
To use the Lambda console to restrict access to the Lambda function


Open the AWS Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.


Navigate to Functions and then select your publicly accessible Lambda function.


Under Designer, choose the key icon at the top left. It has the tool-tip View permissions.


Under Function policy, if the policy allows actions for the principal element “*” or {“AWS”: “*”}, it is publicly accessible.


Consider adding the following IAM condition to scope access to your account only.
"Condition": {
     "StringEquals": {
       "AWS:SourceAccount": "<account_id>"
        }
     }
   }

[PCI.RDS.2] RDS DB Instances should prohibit public access
Severity:  Critical
Resource: RDS DB instance
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-instance-public-access-check.html
Parameters: None
This control checks whether RDS instances are publicly accessible by evaluating the publiclyAccessible field in the instance configuration item. The value of publiclyAccessible indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible. When the DB instance is publicly accessible, it is an Internet-facing instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address. When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.
The control does not check VPC subnet routing settings or the Security Group rules. You should also ensure VPC subnet routing does not allow public access, and that the security group inbound rule associated with the RDS instance does not allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0). You should also ensure that access to your RDS instance configuration is limited to only authorized users by restricting users' IAM permissions to modify RDS instances settings and resources.

[PCI.S3.3] S3 buckets should have cross-region replication enabled
Severity:  Low
Resource: S3 bucket
AWS Config rule:  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-replication-enabled.html
Parameters: None
This control checks whether S3 buckets have cross-region replication enabled.
PCI DSS does not require data replication or highly available configurations. However, this check aligns with AWS best practices for this control.
In addition to availability, you should consider other systems hardening settings.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 2.2: Develop configuration standards for all system components. Assure that these standards address all known security vulnerabilities and are consistent with industry-accepted system hardening standards.
Enabling cross-Region replication on S3 buckets ensures that multiple versions of the data are available in different distinct Regions. This allows you to store data at even greater distances, minimize latency, increase operational efficiency, and protect against DDoS and data corruption events.
This is one method used to implement system hardening configuration.
Remediation
To enable S3 bucket replication


Open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.

[PCI.S3.4] S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
Severity: Medium
Resource: S3 bucket
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled.html
Parameters: None
This control checks that your Amazon S3 bucket either has Amazon S3 default encryption enabled or that the S3 bucket policy explicitly denies put-object requests without server-side encryption.
When you set default encryption on a bucket, all new objects stored in the bucket are encrypted when they are stored, including clear text PAN data.
Server-side encryption for all of the objects stored in a bucket can also be enforced using a bucket policy. For more information about server-side encryption, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements:
PCI DSS 3.4: Render Primary Account Numbers (PAN) unreadable anywhere it is stored (including on portable digital media, backup media, and in logs).
If you use an S3 bucket to store credit card Primary Account Numbers (PAN), then to render the PAN unreadable, the bucket default encryption should be enabled and/or the S3 bucket policy should explicitly deny put-object requests without server-side encryption.
Remediation
To enable default encryption on an S3 bucket


Open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


Choose the bucket from the list.


Choose Properties.


Choose Default encryption.


For the encryption, choose either AES-256 or AWS-KMS.
    To use keys that are managed by Amazon S3 for default encryption, choose AES-256. For more information about using Amazon S3 server-side encryption to encrypt your data, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html.
    To use keys that are managed by AWS KMS for default encryption, choose AWS-KMS. Then choose a master key from the list of the AWS KMS master keys that you have created.
Type the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS KMS key to use. You can find the ARN for your AWS KMS key in the IAM console, under Encryption keys. Or, you can choose a key name from the drop-down list.
Important
 If you use the AWS KMS option for your default encryption configuration, you are subject to the RPS (requests per second) limits of AWS KMS. For more information about AWS KMS limits and how to request a limit increase, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html.
For more information about creating an AWS KMS key, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html.
For more information about using AWS KMS with Amazon S3, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html.


When enabling default encryption, you might need to update your bucket policy. For more information about moving from bucket policies to default encryption, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html#bucket-encryption-update-bucket-policy.

[PCI.S3.5] S3 buckets should require requests to use Secure Socket Layer
Severity: Medium
Resource: S3 Bucket
AWS Config rule: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only.html
Parameters: None
This control checks whether Amazon S3 buckets have policies that require requests to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL). 
S3 buckets should have policies that require all requests (Action: S3:*) to only accept transmission of data over HTTPS in the S3 resource policy, indicated by the condition key aws:SecureTransport.
This does not check the SSL or TLS version. You should not allow early versions of SSL or TLS (SSLv3, TLS1.0) per PCI DSS requirements.
Related PCI DSS requirements
This control is related to the following PCI DSS requirements.
PCI DSS 4.1 Use strong cryptography and security protocols to safeguard sensitive cardholder data during transmission over open, public networks.
If you use S3 buckets to store cardholder data, ensure that bucket policies require that requests to the bucket only accept transmission of data over HTTPS. For example, you could use the policy statement "aws:SecureTransport": "false" to deny any requests not accessed through HTTPS. Allowing unencrypted transmissions of cardholder data might violate the requirement to use strong cryptography and security protocols to safeguard sensitive cardholder data during transmission over open, public networks.
Remediation
To remediate this issue, update the permissions policy of the S3 bucket.
To configure an S3 bucket to deny nonsecure transport

Parameters: None
This control checks whether the status of the AWS Systems Manager association compliance is COMPLIANT or NON_COMPLIANT after the association is run on an instance. The control passes if the association compliance status is COMPLIANT.
A State Manager association is a configuration that is assigned to your managed instances. The configuration defines the state that you want to maintain on your instances. For example, an association can specify that antivirus software must be installed and running on your instances, or that certain ports must be closed.
After you create one or more State Manager associations, compliance status information is immediately available to you in the console or in response to AWS CLI commands or corresponding Systems Manager API operations. For associations, Configuration Compliance shows statuses of Compliant or Non-compliant and the severity level assigned to the association, such as Critical or Medium. To learn more about State Manager association compliance, see About State Manager association compliance in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
You must configure your in-scope EC2 instances for Systems Manager association. You must also configure the patch baseline for the security rating of the vendor of patches, and set the autoapproval date to meet PCI DSS 3.2.1 requirement 6.2.
