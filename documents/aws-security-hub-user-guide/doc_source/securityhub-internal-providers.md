# Available AWS service integrations<a name="securityhub-internal-providers"></a>

Security Hub supports integrations with several AWS services\.

**Note**  
Some integrations are not available in Africa \(Cape Town\), Asia Pacific \(Hong Kong\), Europe \(Milan\), AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\), or AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\)\. If an integration is not supported, it is not listed on the **Integrations** page\.

For these services, the integration allows the service to send findings to Security Hub:
+ [AWS Firewall Manager](#integration-aws-firewall-manager)
+ [IAM Access Analyzer](#integration-iam-access-analyzer)
+ [Amazon GuardDuty](#integration-amazon-guardduty)
+ [Amazon Inspector](#integration-amazon-inspector)
+ [Amazon Macie](#integration-amazon-macie)

Security Hub also supports an integration with [Amazon Detective](#integration-amazon-detective)\. That integration allows you to pivot from Security Hub to Detective to investigate a GuardDuty finding\.

Here are the details about each AWS service integration\.

**AWS Firewall Manager**  <a name="integration-aws-firewall-manager"></a>
Firewall Manager sends findings to Security Hub when a WAF policy for resources or a web ACL rule is not in compliance\. Firewall Manager also sends findings when AWS Shield Advanced is not protecting resources, or when an attack is identified\.  
If you are already using Firewall Manager, Security Hub automatically enables this integration\. You do not need to take any additional action to begin to receive findings from Firewall Manager\.  
To learn more about the integration, view the **Integrations** page in the Security Hub console\.  
To learn more about Firewall Manager, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/)\.

**IAM Access Analyzer**  <a name="integration-iam-access-analyzer"></a>
With IAM Access Analyzer, all findings are sent to Security Hub\.  
IAM Access Analyzer uses logic\-based reasoning to analyze resource\-based policies that are applied to supported resources in your account\. IAM Access Analyzer generates a finding when it detects a policy statement that allows an external principal access to a resource in your account\.  
To learn more, see [What is IAM Access Analyzer?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**Amazon Detective**  <a name="integration-amazon-detective"></a>
Detective automatically collects log data from your AWS resources and uses machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to help you visualize and conduct faster and more efficient security investigations\.  
The Security Hub integration with Detective allows you to pivot from Amazon GuardDuty findings in Security Hub into Detective\. You can then use the Detective tools and visualizations to investigate them\. The integration does not require any additional configuration in Security Hub or Detective\.  
For the GuardDuty finding types that Detective supports, the finding details include an **Investigate in Detective** subsection\. That subsection contains the link to Detective\. See [Pivoting to a finding profile from Amazon GuardDuty or AWS Security Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/userguide/profile-pivot-from-service.html) in the *Amazon Detective User Guide*\.  
For the list of finding types that Detective supports, see [Supported finding types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/userguide/supported-finding-types.html)\.  
If a link does not work, then for troubleshooting advice, see [Troubleshooting the pivot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/userguide/profile-pivot-from-service.html#profile-pivot-troubleshooting)\.

**Amazon GuardDuty**  <a name="integration-amazon-guardduty"></a>
GuardDuty sends findings to Security Hub for all of the supported finding types\.  
New findings from GuardDuty are sent to Security Hub within 5 minutes\. Updates to findings are sent based on the **Updated findings** setting for CloudWatch Events in GuardDuty settings\.  
When you generate GuardDuty sample findings using the GuardDuty **Settings** page, Security Hub receives the sample findings and omits the prefix '\[Sample\]' in the finding type\. For example, the sample finding type in GuardDuty "\[SAMPLE\] Recon:IAMUser/ResourcePermissions" is displayed as "Recon:IAMUser/ResourcePermissions‚Äù in Security Hub\.  
For more information about GuardDuty findings, see [Amazon GuardDuty findings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_findings.html) in the *Amazon GuardDuty User Guide*\.

**Amazon Inspector**  <a name="integration-amazon-inspector"></a>
Amazon Inspector sends Amazon Inspector findings to Security Hub that are generated through assessment runs for all supported rules packages\.  
For more information about Amazon Inspector rules packages and rules, see [Amazon Inspector rules packages and rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_rule-packages.html) in the *Amazon Inspector User Guide*\.

**Amazon Macie**  <a name="integration-amazon-macie"></a>
A finding from Macie can indicate that there is a policy violation, or that sensitive data, such as personal identifying information \(PII\) and intellectual property, is present in the data that your organization stores in Amazon S3\. Macie only sends policy violation findings to Security Hub\.  
For more information, see [Amazon Macie findings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/findings.html) in the *Amazon Macie User Guide*\.  
Security Hub can also receive findings from Macie Classic\. Macie Classic sends basic and custom findings to Macie from the **S3 bucket properties** and **S3 objects** indices\. Macie Classic does not send data classifications, or findings from the **CloudTrail data** index\.  
For more information, see [Locating and analyzing Macie Classic alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/userguide/macie-alerts.html#macie-alert-working-locate) in the *Amazon Macie Classic User Guide*\.
