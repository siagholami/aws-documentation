# Viewing and taking action on control findings<a name="securityhub-control-manage-findings"></a>

The control details page contains a list of active findings for the control\. The list does not include archived findings\.

The list provides tools to filter and sort the findings, so that you can focus on more urgent findings first\. Each finding can include links to resource details in the related service console\. For controls that are based on AWS Config rules, you can view details about the rule and the configuration timeline\.

You can also use the AWS Security Hub API to retrieve a list of findings\. See [Retrieving finding details \(Security Hub API, AWS CLI\)](finding-retrieve-api-cli.md)\.
