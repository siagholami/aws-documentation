PCI DSS controls that you might want to disable
To save on the cost of AWS Config, you can disable recording of global resources in all but one Region. Then disable these controls that deal with global resources in all Regions except for the Region that runs global recording.
 [PCI.IAM.1] IAM root user access key should not exist
 [PCI.IAM.2] IAM users should not have IAM policies attached
 [PCI.IAM.3] IAM policies should not allow full "*" administrative privileges
 [PCI.IAM.4] Hardware MFA should be enabled for the root user
 [PCI.IAM.5] Virtual MFA should be enabled for the root user
 [PCI.IAM.6] MFA should be enabled for all IAM users
If you disable these controls and disable recording of global resources in a particular Region, you should also disable [PCI.Config.1] AWS Config should be enabled. This is because  [PCI.Config.1] AWS Config should be enabled requires recording of global resources in order to pass.
