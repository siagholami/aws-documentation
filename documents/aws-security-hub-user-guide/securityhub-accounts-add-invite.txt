Adding and inviting member accounts
Your account becomes an AWS Security Hub master account when an account that you invite accepts your invitation.
When you accept an invitation from another account, your account becomes a member account.
If your account is a master account, you cannot accept an invitation to become a member account.
Adding a member account consists of the following steps:


The master account adds the member account to their list of member accounts.


The master account sends an invitation to the member account.


The member account accepts the invitation. 


Adding member accounts (console)
From the Security Hub console, you can add accounts to your list of member accounts. You can select accounts individually, or upload a .csv file that contains the account information.
To add accounts to your list of member accounts


Open the AWS Security Hub console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/.


In the left pane, choose Settings.


On the Settings page, choose Accounts and then choose Add accounts. You can then either add accounts individually or upload a .csv file containing the list of accounts.


To select the accounts, do one of the following:
    To add the accounts individually, under Enter accounts, enter the account ID of the account to add, and then choose Add.
To add more accounts, enter the account ID and then choose Add for each account.
    To use a comma-separated values (.csv) file to add multiple accounts, first create the file. The file must contain the account ID and email address for each account to add.
Important
In your .csv list, accounts must appear one per line. The first line of the .csv file must contain the header. In the header, the first column is Account ID and the second column is Email.
Each subsequent line must contain a valid account ID and email address for the account to add.
Here is an example of a .csv file when viewed in a text editor.  
Account ID,Email
 111111111111,user@example.com
In a spreadsheet program, the fields appear in separate columns. The underlying format is still comma-separated.
To select the file, on the console, choose Upload list (.csv).


After you finish adding accounts, choose Add. Then, under Accounts to be added, choose Next.


Inviting member accounts (console)
After you add the member account, you send an invitation to the member account. You can also resend an invitation to an account that you disassociated.
To send an invitation to a new account


Open the AWS Security Hub console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/.


In the navigation pane, choose Settings, and then choose Accounts. 


For the account to invite, choose Invite in the Status column.


When prompted to confirm, choose Invite.


To resend an invitation to accounts that you disassociated


Open the AWS Security Hub console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/.


In the navigation pane, choose Settings, and then choose Accounts. 


Select each disassociated account that you want to resend an invitation to.


From Actions, choose Resend invitation.
