Using BatchUpdateFindings to update a finding
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html is used to update information related to a customer's processing of findings from finding providers. It can be used by a customer or by a SIEM, ticketing, incident management, or SOAR tool that works on behalf of a customer. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html cannot be used to create new findings. It can be used to update up to 100 findings at a time.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html does not change the UpdatedAt field for the finding. UpdatedAt only reflects the most recent update from the finding provider.
Available fields for BatchUpdateFindings
Master accounts can use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html to update findings for their account or for their member accounts. Member accounts can use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html to update findings for their account.
Customers can only use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html to update the following fields and objects.
 Confidence
 Criticality
 Note
 RelatedFindings
 Severity
 Types
 UserDefinedFields
 VerificationState
 Workflow
By default, master and member accounts have access to all of the above fields and field values. Security Hub also provides context keys to allow you to restrict access to fields and field values.
For example, you might only allow member accounts to set Workflow.Status to RESOLVED. Or you might not want to allow member accounts to change Severity.Label.
Configuring access to BatchUpdateFindings
You can configure IAM policies to restrict access to using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html to update fields and field values.
In a statement to restrict access to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html, use the following values.
 Action is securityhub:BatchUpdateFindings
 Effect is Deny
 For Condition, you can deny a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html request based on the following:
   The finding includes a specific field.
   The finding includes a specific field value.
Context keys
These are the context keys for restricting access to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html.
ASFF field
The context key for an ASFF field is as follows.  
securityhub:ASFFSyntaxPath/<fieldName>
Replace <fieldName> with the ASFF field.
For example, to restrict access to the Workflow.Status field, usesecurityhub:ASFFSyntaxPath/Workflow.Status.
Disallowing all updates to a field
To prevent a user from making any update to a specific field, use a condition like this:
"Condition": {
                "Null": {
                    "securityhub:ASFFSyntaxPath/<fieldName>": "false"
               }
}
For example, the following statement indicates that https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html cannot be used to update the workflow status.
{
    "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "securityhub:BatchUpdateFindings",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "Null": {
            "securityhub:ASFFSyntaxPath/Workflow.Status": "false"
        }
    }
}
Disallowing specific field values
To prevent a user from setting a field to a specific value, use a condition like this:
"Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "securityhub:ASFFSyntaxPath/<fieldName>": "<fieldValue>"
               }
}
For example, the following statement indicates that https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html cannot be used to set Workflow.Status to SUPPRESSED.
{
    "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "securityhub:BatchUpdateFindings",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
        "securityhub:ASFFSyntaxPath/Workflow.Status": "SUPPRESSED"
    }
}
You can also provide a list of values that are not permitted.
"Condition": {
                "ForAnyValue:StringEquals": {
                    "securityhub:ASFFSyntaxPath/<fieldName>": [ "<fieldValue1>", "<fieldValue2>", "<fieldValuen>" ]
               }
}
For example, the following statement indicates that https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html cannot be used to set Workflow.Status to either RESOLVED or SUPPRESSED.
{
    "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "securityhub:BatchUpdateFindings",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
    "ForAnyValue:StringEquals": {
        "securityhub:ASFFSyntaxPath/Workflow.Status": [
            "RESOLVED",
            "NOTIFIED"
        ]
    }
}
Using the batch-update-findings command from the AWS CLI
In the AWS Command Line Interface, you use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/securityhub/batch-update-findings.html command to update the findings.
For each finding to update, you provide both the finding ID and the ARN of the product that generated the finding.
--finding-identifiers ID="<findingID1>",ProductArn="<productARN>" ID="<findingID2>",ProductArn="<productARN2>"
When you provide the attributes to update, you can either use a JSON format or a shortcut format.
Here is an example of an update to the Note object that uses the JSON format:
--note '{"Text": "Known issue that is not a risk.", "UpdatedBy": "user1"}'
Here is the same update that uses the shortcut format:
--note Text="Known issue that is not a risk.",UpdatedBy="user1"
The AWS CLI Command Reference provides the JSON and shortcut syntax for each field.
The following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/securityhub/batch-update-findings.html example updates two findings to add a note, change the severity label, and resolve them.
aws securityhub batch-update-findings --finding-identifiers Id="arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1/PCI.Lambda.2/finding/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",ProductArn="arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-2::product/aws/securityhub" Id="arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1/PCI.Lambda.2/finding/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",ProductArn="arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1::product/aws/securityhub" --note '{"Text": "Known issue that is not a risk.", "UpdatedBy": "user1"}' --severity '{"Label": "LOW"}' --workflow '{"Status": "RESOLVED"}'
This is the same example, but uses the shortcuts instead of JSON.
aws securityhub batch-update-findings --finding-identifiers Id="arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1/PCI.Lambda.2/finding/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",ProductArn="arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1::product/aws/securityhub" Id="arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1/PCI.Lambda.2/finding/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",ProductArn="arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1::product/aws/securityhub" --note Text="Known issue that is not a risk.",UpdatedBy="user1" --severity Label="LOW" --workflow Status="RESOLVED"
