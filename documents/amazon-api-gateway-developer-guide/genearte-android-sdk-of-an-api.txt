Generate the Android SDK of an API
To generate the Android SDK of an API in API Gateway


Sign in to the API Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway.


Choose a REST API.


Choose Stages. 


In the Stages pane, choose the name of the stage.


On the SDK Generation tab, for Platform, choose the Android platform. 


For Group ID, enter the unique identifier for the corresponding project. This is used in the pom.xml file (for example, com.mycompany).


For Invoker package, enter the namespace for the generated client classes (for example, com.mycompany.clientsdk).


For Artifact ID, enter the name of the compiled .jar file without the version. This is used in the pom.xml file (for example, aws-apigateway-api-sdk).


For Artifact version, enter the artifact version number for the generated client. This is used in the pom.xml file and should follow a major.minor.patch pattern (for example, 1.0.0).


Choose Generate SDK, and then follow the on-screen directions to download the SDK generated by API Gateway.


Follow the instructions in Use an Android SDK generated by API Gateway for a REST API to use the generated SDK. 


Every time you update an API, you must redeploy the API and regenerate the SDK to have the updates included.
