Sending data from backend services to connected clients
API Gateway WebSocket APIs offer the following ways for you to send data from backend services to connected clients:
 An integration can send a response, which is returned to the client by a route response that you have defined.
 You can use the @connections API to send a POST request. For more information, see Use @connections commands in your backend service.
