API Gateway quotas
Unless noted otherwise, the quotas can be increased upon request. To request a quota increase, you can use Service Quotas or contact the AWS Support Center.
When authorization is enabled on a method, the maximum length of the method's ARN (for example, arn:aws:execute-api:{region-id}:{account-id}:{api-id}/{stage-id}/{method}/{resource}/{path}) is 1600 bytes. The path parameter values (whose size is determined at runtime) can cause the ARN length to exceed the limit. When this happens, the API client receives a 414 Request URI too long response. 
Note
This limits URI length when resource policies are used. In the case of private APIs where a resource policy is required, this limits the URI length of all private APIs.
API Gateway account-level quotas
The following quotas apply at the account level per Region in Amazon API Gateway.



Resource or operation
Default quota
Can be increased




Throttle quota per Region across HTTP APIs, REST APIs, WebSocket APIs, and WebSocket callback APIs
10,000 requests per second (RPS) with an additional burst capacity provided by the token bucket algorithm, using a maximum bucket capacity of 5,000 requests.  The burst quota is determined by the API Gateway service team based on the overall RPS quota for the account. It is not a quota that a customer can control or request changes to.
