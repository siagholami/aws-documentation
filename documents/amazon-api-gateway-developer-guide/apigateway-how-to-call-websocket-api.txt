Invoking a WebSocket API
After you've deployed your WebSocket API, client applications can connect to it and send messages to itâ€”and your backend service can send messages to connected client applications:
 You can use wscat to connect to your WebSocket API and send messages to it to simulate client behavior. See Use wscat to connect to a WebSocket API and send messages to it.
 You can use the @connections API from your backend service to send a callback message to a connected client, get connection information, or disconnect the client. See Use @connections commands in your backend service.
 A client application can use its own WebSocket library to invoke your WebSocket API.
