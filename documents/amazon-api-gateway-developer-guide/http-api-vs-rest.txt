Choosing between HTTP APIs and REST APIs

HTTP APIs are designed for low-latency, cost-effective AWS Lambda proxy and HTTP proxy APIs. HTTP APIs support OIDC and OAuth 2.0 authorization, and come with built-in support for CORS and automatic deployments. Previous-generation REST APIs currently offer more features, and full control over API requests and responses.
The following tables summarize core features that are available in HTTP APIs and REST APIs.
