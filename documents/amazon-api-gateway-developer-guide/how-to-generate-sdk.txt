Generating an SDK for a REST API in API Gateway
To call your REST API in a platform- or language-specific way, you must generate the platform- or language-specific SDK of the API. Currently, API Gateway supports generating an SDK for an API in Java, JavaScript, Java for Android, Objective-C or Swift for iOS, and Ruby.
This section explains how to generate an SDK of an API Gateway API. It also demonstrates how to use the generated SDK in a Java app, a Java for Android app, Objective-C and Swift for iOS apps, and a JavaScript app. 
To facilitate the discussion, we use this API Gateway API, which exposes this Simple Calculator Lambda function. 
Before proceeding, create or import the API and deploy it at least once in API Gateway. For instructions, see Deploying a REST API in Amazon API Gateway.
