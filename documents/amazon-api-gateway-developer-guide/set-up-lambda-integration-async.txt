Set up asynchronous invocation of the backend Lambda function
In Lambda non-proxy (custom) integration, the backend Lambda function is invoked synchronously by default. This is the desired behavior for most REST API operations. Some applications, however, require work to be performed asynchronously (as a batch operation or a long-latency operation), typically by a separate backend component. In this case, the backend Lambda function is invoked asynchronously, and the front-end REST API method doesn't return the result.
You can configure the Lambda function for a Lambda non-proxy integration to be invoked asynchronously by specifying 'Event' as the Lambda invocation type. This is done as follows:
Configure Lambda asynchronous invocation in the API Gateway console
For all invocations to be asynchronous:
 In Integration Request, add an X-Amz-Invocation-Type header with a static value of 'Event'.
For clients to decide if invocations are asynchronous or synchronous:


In Method Request, add an InvocationType header.


In Integration Request add an X-Amz-Invocation-Type header with a mapping expression of method.request.header.InvocationType.


Clients can include the InvocationType: Event header in API requests for asynchronous invocations or InvocationType: RequestResponse for synchronous invocations.
