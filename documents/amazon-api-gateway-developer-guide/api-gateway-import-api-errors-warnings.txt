Errors and warnings during import
Errors during import
During the import, errors can be generated for major issues like an invalid OpenAPI document. Errors are returned as exceptions (for example, BadRequestException) in an unsuccessful response. When an error occurs, the new API definition is discarded and no change is made to the existing API. 
Warnings during import
During the import, warnings can be generated for minor issues like a missing model reference. If a warning occurs, the operation will continue if the failonwarnings=false query expression is appended to the request URL. Otherwise, the updates will be rolled back. By default, failonwarnings is set to false. In such cases, warnings are returned as a field in the resulting RestApi resource. Otherwise, warnings are returned as a message in the exception.
