View API Gateway log events in the CloudWatch console
To view logged API requests and responses using the CloudWatch console


In the navigation pane, choose Logs.


Under the Log Groups table, choose a log group of the API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_{rest-api-id}/{stage-name} name. 


Under the Log Streams table, choose a log stream. You can use the timestamp to help locate the log stream of your interest. 


Choose Text to view raw text or choose Row to view the event row by row.


Important
 CloudWatch lets you delete log groups or streams. Do not manually delete API Gateway API log groups or streams; let API Gateway manage these resources. Manually deleting log groups or streams may cause API requests and responses not to be logged. If that happens, you can delete the entire log group for the API and redeploy the API. This is because API Gateway creates log groups or log streams for an API stage at the time when it is deployed.
