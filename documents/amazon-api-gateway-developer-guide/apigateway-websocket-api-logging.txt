Monitoring WebSocket API execution with CloudWatch metrics
You can use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor WebSocket APIs. The configuration is similar to that used for REST APIs. For more information, see Monitoring REST API execution with Amazon CloudWatch metrics.
The following metrics are supported for WebSocket APIs:



Metric
Description




ConnectCount
The number of messages sent to the $connect route integration.


MessageCount
The number of messages sent to the WebSocket API, either from or to the client.


IntegrationError
The number of requests that return a 4XX/5XX response from the integration.


ClientError
The number of requests that have a 4XX response returned by API Gateway before the integration is invoked.


ExecutionError
Errors that occurred when calling the integration.


IntegrationLatency
The time difference between API Gateway sending the request to the integration and API Gateway receiving the response from the integration. Suppressed for callbacks and mock integrations.



You can use the dimensions in the following table to filter API Gateway metrics.



Dimension
Description




ApiId
Filters API Gateway metrics for an API with the specified API ID.


ApiId, Stage
Filters API Gateway metrics for an API stage with the specified API ID and stage ID.


ApiId, Stage, Route
Filters API Gateway metrics for an API method with the specified API ID, stage ID, and route ID. API Gateway will not send these metrics unless you have explicitly enabled detailed CloudWatch metrics. You can do this by calling the UpdateStage action of the API Gateway V2 REST API to update the metricsEnabled property to true. Enabling such metrics will incur additional charges to your account. For pricing information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing.
