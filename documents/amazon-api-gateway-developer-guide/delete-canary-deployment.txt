Disable a canary release
To disable a canary release deployment is to set the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/#canarySettings to null to remove it from the stage. 
You can disable a canary release deployment using the API Gateway console, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK.

Disable a canary release using the API Gateway console
To use the API Gateway console to disable a canary release deployment, use the following steps:


Sign in to the API Gateway console and choose an existing API in the primary navigation pane.


Choose Stages under the API and then choose an existing stage under the Stages list to open the Stage Editor.


Choose the Canary tab in the Stage Editor.


Choose Delete Canary.


Confirm you want to delete the canary by choosing Delete.


As a result, the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/#canarySettings property becomes null and is removed from the deployment stage. You can verify this using the AWS CLI. For example, see Disable a canary release using the AWS CLI.
Disable a canary release using the AWS CLI
To use the AWS CLI to disable a canary release deployment, call the update-stage command as follows:
aws apigateway update-stage \
    --rest-api-id 4wk1k4onj3 \
    --stage-name canary \
    --patch-operations '[{"op":"remove", "path":"/canarySettings"}]'
A successful response returns a payload similar to the following:
{
    "stageName": "prod", 
    "accessLogSettings": {
        ...
    }, 
    "cacheClusterEnabled": false, 
    "cacheClusterStatus": "NOT_AVAILABLE", 
    "deploymentId": "nfcn0x", 
    "lastUpdatedDate": 1511309280, 
    "createdDate": 1511152939, 
    "methodSettings": {
        ...
    }
}
As shown in the output, the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/#canarySettings property is no longer present in the stage of a canary-disabled deployment.
