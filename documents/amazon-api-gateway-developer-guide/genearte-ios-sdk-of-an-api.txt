Generate the iOS SDK of an API
To generate the iOS SDK of an API in API Gateway


Sign in to the API Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway.


Choose a REST API.


Choose Stages. 


In the Stages pane, choose the name of the stage.


On the SDK Generation tab, for Platform, choose the iOS (Objective-C) or iOS (Swift) platform. 


Type a unique prefix in the Prefix box.
The effect of prefix is as follows: if you assign, for example, SIMPLE_CALC as the prefix for the SDK of the SimpleCalc API with Input, Output, and Result models, the generated SDK will contain the SIMPLE_CALCSimpleCalcClient class that encapsulates the API, including the method requests/responses. In addition, the generated SDK will contain the SIMPLE_CALCInput, SIMPLE_CALCOutput, and SIMPLE_CALCResult classes to represent the input, output, and results, respectively, to represent the request input and response output. For more information, see Use iOS SDK generated by API Gateway for a REST API in Objective-C or Swift. 


Choose Generate SDK, and then follow the on-screen directions to download the SDK generated by API Gateway.


Follow the instructions in Use iOS SDK generated by API Gateway for a REST API in Objective-C or Swift to use the generated SDK.


Every time you update an API, you must redeploy the API and regenerate the SDK to have the updates included.
