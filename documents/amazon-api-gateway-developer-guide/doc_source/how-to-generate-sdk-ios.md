# Use iOS SDK generated by API Gateway for a REST API in Objective\-C or Swift<a name="how-to-generate-sdk-ios"></a>

In this tutorial, we will show how to use an iOS SDK generated by API Gateway for a REST API in an Objective\-C or Swift app to call the underlying API\. We will use the [SimpleCalc API](simple-calc-lambda-api.md) as an example to illustrate the following topics:
+ How to install the required AWS Mobile SDK components into your Xcode project
+ How to create the API client object before calling the API's methods
+ How to call the API methods through the corresponding SDK methods on the API client object
+ How to prepare a method input and parse its result using the corresponding model classes of the SDK
