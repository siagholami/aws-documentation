Using Amazon API Gateway, you can create private REST APIs that can be accessed only from your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\)\. The VPC uses an [interface VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html), which is an endpoint network interface that you create in your VPC\. Using [ resource policies](apigateway-private-apis.md#apigateway-private-api-set-up-resource-policy), you can allow or deny access to your API from selected VPCs and VPC endpoints, including across AWS accounts\. Each endpoint can be used to access multiple private APIs\. You can also use AWS Direct Connect to establish a connection from an on\-premises network to Amazon VPC and access your private API over that connection\. In all cases, traffic to your private API uses secure connections and does not leave the Amazon network; it is isolated from the public internet\. To learn more, see [Creating a private API in Amazon API Gateway](apigateway-private-apis.md)\.
