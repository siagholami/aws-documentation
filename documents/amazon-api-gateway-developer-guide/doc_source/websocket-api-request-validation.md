# Request validation<a name="websocket-api-request-validation"></a>

You can configure API Gateway to perform validation on a route request before proceeding with the integration request\. If the validation fails, API Gateway fails the request without calling your backend, sends a "Bad request body" gateway response to the client, and publishes the validation results in CloudWatch Logs\. Using validation this way reduces unnecessary calls to your API backend\.

## Model selection expressions<a name="apigateway-websocket-api-model-selection-expressions"></a>

You can use a model selection expression to dynamically validate requests within the same route\. Model validation occurs if you provide a model selection expression for either proxy or non\-proxy integrations\. You might need to define the `$default` model as a fallback when no matching model is found\. If there is no matching model and `$default` isn't defined, the validation fails\. The selection expression looks like `Route.ModelSelectionExpression` and evaluates to the key for `Route.RequestModels`\.

When you define a [route](websocket-api-develop-routes.md#apigateway-websocket-api-route-route-request) for a WebSocket API, you can optionally specify a *model selection expression*\. This expression is evaluated to select the model to be used for body validation when a request is received\. The expression evaluates to one of the entries in a route's [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigatewayv2/latest/api-reference/apis-apiid-routes.html#apis-apiid-routes-prop-route-requestmodels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigatewayv2/latest/api-reference/apis-apiid-routes.html#apis-apiid-routes-prop-route-requestmodels)\.

A model is expressed as a [JSON schema](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) and describes the data structure of the request body\. The nature of this selection expression enables you to dynamically choose the model to validate against at runtime for a particular route\.
