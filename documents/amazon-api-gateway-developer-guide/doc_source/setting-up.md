Before using Amazon API Gateway for the first time, you must have an AWS account\.

In many of the tutorials in [Getting started with Amazon API Gateway](getting-started.md) and [Amazon API Gateway tutorials](api-gateway-tutorials.md), the necessary IAM policies are created for you\. However, when you begin creating your own API, you'll need to study the information below and in [Control access to an API with IAM permissions](permissions.md)\.

## Sign up for an AWS account<a name="setting-up-sign-up"></a>

To use Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and other AWS services, you need an AWS account\. If you don't have an account, visit [aws\.amazon\.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choose **Create an AWS Account**\. For detailed instructions, see [Create and Activate an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)\.

## Create an IAM administrator user<a name="setting-up-iam"></a>

As a best practice, you should also create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user with administrator permissions\. Use that for all work that does not require root credentials\. Create a password for console access, and access keys to use command line tools\. For instructions, see [Creating Your First IAM Admin User and Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
