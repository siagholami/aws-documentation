# API references<a name="api-ref"></a>

Amazon API Gateway provides APIs for creating and deploying your own HTTP and WebSocket APIs\. In addition, API Gateway APIs are available in standard AWS SDKs\.

If you are using a language for which an AWS SDK exists, you may prefer to use the SDK rather than using the API Gateway REST APIs directly\. The SDKs make authentication simpler, integrate easily with your development environment, and provide easy access to API Gateway commands\.

Here's where to find the AWS SDKs and API Gateway REST API reference documentation:
+ [Tools for Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)
+ [Amazon API Gateway Version 1 API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/) \(REST APIs\) 
+ [Amazon API Gateway Version 2 API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigatewayv2/latest/api-reference/api-reference.html) \(WebSocket and HTTP APIs\)
