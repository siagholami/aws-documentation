# Generate the iOS SDK of an API<a name="genearte-ios-sdk-of-an-api"></a>

**To generate the iOS SDK of an API in API Gateway**

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway)\.

1. Choose a REST API\.

1. Choose **Stages**\. 

1. In the **Stages** pane, choose the name of the stage\.

1. On the **SDK Generation** tab, for **Platform**, choose the **iOS \(Objective\-C\) or iOS \(Swift\)** platform\. 

   1. Type a unique prefix in the **Prefix** box\.

     The effect of prefix is as follows: if you assign, for example, `SIMPLE_CALC` as the prefix for the SDK of the [SimpleCalc](simple-calc-lambda-api.md) API with `Input`, `Output`, and `Result` models, the generated SDK will contain the `SIMPLE_CALCSimpleCalcClient` class that encapsulates the API, including the method requests/responses\. In addition, the generated SDK will contain the `SIMPLE_CALCInput`, `SIMPLE_CALCOutput`, and `SIMPLE_CALCResult` classes to represent the input, output, and results, respectively, to represent the request input and response output\. For more information, see [Use iOS SDK generated by API Gateway for a REST API in Objective\-C or Swift](how-to-generate-sdk-ios.md)\. 

1. Choose **Generate SDK**, and then follow the on\-screen directions to download the SDK generated by API Gateway\.

1. Follow the instructions in [Use iOS SDK generated by API Gateway for a REST API in Objective\-C or Swift](how-to-generate-sdk-ios.md) to use the generated SDK\.

 Every time you update an API, you must redeploy the API and regenerate the SDK to have the updates included\.
