API Gateway provides a number of ways to protect your API from certain threats, like malicious users or spikes in traffic\. You can protect your API using strategies like generating SSL certificates, configuring a web application firewall, setting throttling limits, and only allowing access to your API from a Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\)\. In this section you can learn how to enable these capabilities using API Gateway\.
