# Working with REST APIs<a name="apigateway-rest-api"></a>

A REST API in API Gateway is a collection of resources and methods that are integrated with backend HTTP endpoints, Lambda functions, or other AWS services\. You can use API Gateway features to help you with all aspects of the API lifecycle, from creation through monitoring your production APIs\.

API Gateway REST APIs use a request/response model where a client sends a request to a service and the service responds back synchronously\. This kind of model is suitable for many different kinds of applications that depend on synchronous communication\.
