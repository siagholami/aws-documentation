# Build an API Gateway REST API with HTTP integration<a name="getting-started-http-integrations"></a>

 To build an API with HTTP integration, you can use either the HTTP proxy integration or the HTTP custom integration\. We recommend that you use the HTTP proxy integration, whenever possible, for the streamlined API set up while providing versatile and powerful features\. The HTTP custom integration can be compelling if it is necessary to transform client request data for the backend or transform the backend response data for the client\.
