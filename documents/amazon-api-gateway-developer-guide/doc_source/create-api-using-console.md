 To set up an API Gateway API using the API Gateway console, see [Tutorial: Build a REST API with HTTP non\-proxy integration](api-gateway-create-api-step-by-step.md)\. 

 You can learn how to set up an API by following an example\. For more information, see [Tutorial: Create a REST API by importing an example](api-gateway-create-api-from-example.md)\. 

 Alternatively, you can set up an API by using the API Gateway [Import API](api-gateway-import-api.md) feature to upload an external API definition, such as one expressed in [OpenAPI 2\.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) with the [Working with API Gateway extensions to OpenAPI](api-gateway-swagger-extensions.md)\. The example provided in [Tutorial: Create a REST API by importing an example](api-gateway-create-api-from-example.md) uses the Import API feature\.
