# Infrastructure Security in AWS Control Tower<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

AWS Control Tower is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the [Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper\.

You use AWS published API calls for access to AWS services and resources within your landing zone through the network\. Clients must support Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) 1\.0 or later\. We recommend TLS 1\.2 or later\. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\) such as Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(DHE\) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(ECDHE\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

You can set up security groups to provide additional network infrastructure security for your AWS Control Tower landing zone workloads\. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Setting Up Security Groups in AWS Control Tower With AWS Firewall Manager](firewall-setup-walkthrough.md)\.
