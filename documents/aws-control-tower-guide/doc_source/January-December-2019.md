+ [General availability of AWS Control Tower version 2\.2](#Version-2-2)
+ [New elective guardrails in AWS Control Tower ](#Elective-gaurdrails)

## General availability of AWS Control Tower version 2\.2<a name="Version-2-2"></a>

**November 13, 2019**

\(Update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\. For information, see [Update Your Landing Zone](configuration-updates.md#update-controltower)\.\)

AWS Control Tower version 2\.2 provides three new preventive guardrails that prevent drift in accounts:
+ [Disallow Changes to CloudWatch Logs Log Groups](mandatory-guardrails.md#log-group-deletion-policy) 
+ [Disallow Deletion of AWS Config Aggregation Authorization](mandatory-guardrails.md#config-aggregation-authorization-policy) 
+ [Disallow Deletion of Log Archive](mandatory-guardrails.md#disallow-audit-bucket-deletion) 

A guardrail is a high\-level rule that provides ongoing governance for your overall AWS environment\. When you create your AWS Control Tower landing zone, the landing zone and all the organizational units \(OUs\), accounts, and resources are compliant with the governance rules enforced by your chosen guardrails\. As you and your organization members use the landing zone, changes \(accidental or intentional\) in this compliance status may occur\. Drift detection helps you identify resources that need changes or configuration updates to resolve the drift\. For more information, see [Detect and resolve drift in AWS Control Tower](drift.md)\.

## General availability of AWS Control Tower version 2\.1<a name="Version-2-1"></a>

**June 24, 2019**

\(Update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\. For information, see [Update Your Landing Zone](configuration-updates.md#update-controltower)\.\)

AWS Control Tower is now generally available and supported for production use\. AWS Control Tower is intended for organizations with multiple accounts and teams who are looking for the easiest way to set up their new multi\-account AWS environment and govern at scale\. With AWS Control Tower, you can help make sure that accounts in your organization are compliant with established policies\. End users on distributed teams can provision new AWS accounts quickly\.

Using AWS Control Tower, you can [set up a landing zone](getting-started-with-control-tower.md) that employs best practices such as configuring a [multi\-account structure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/aws-multi-account-landing-zone.html) using AWS Organizations, managing user identities and federated access with AWS Single Sign\-On, enabling account provisioning through AWS Service Catalog, and creating a centralized log archive using AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config\. 

For ongoing governance, you can enable pre\-configured guardrails, which are clearly defined rules for security, operations, and compliance\. Guardrails help prevent deployment of resources that donâ€™t conform to policies and continuously monitor deployed resources for nonconformance\. The AWS Control Tower dashboard provides centralized visibility into an AWS environment including accounts provisioned, guardrails enabled, and the compliance status of accounts\.

You can set up a new multi\-account environment with a single click in the AWS Control Tower console\. There are no additional charges or upfront commitments to use AWS Control Tower\. You pay only for those AWS services that you enabled to set up a landing zone and implement selected guardrails\.
