# Resilience in AWS Control Tower<a name="disaster-recovery-resiliency"></a>

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones\. 

 AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected by means of low\-latency, high\-throughput, and highly redundant networking\. Availability Zones allow you to design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption\. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures\.

AWS Control Tower is available in these AWS Regions:
+ US East \(N\. Virginia\)
+ US East \(Ohio\)
+ US West \(Oregon\)
+ Europe \(Ireland\)
+ Asia Pacific \(Sydney\)

Your *home region* is defined as the AWS Region in which your landing zone was set up\.
