Store Objects with Amazon S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks using the simple and intuitive web interface of the AWS Management Console. For more information, see Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide.
When you set up your landing zone, an Amazon S3 bucket is created in your log archive account to contain all logs across all accounts in your landing zone.
