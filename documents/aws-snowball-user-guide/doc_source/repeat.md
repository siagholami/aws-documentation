# Repeat the Process<a name="repeat"></a>

Once we receive a returned Snowball for your export job part, we perform a complete erasure of the Snowball\. This erasure follows the National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) 800\-88 standards\. This step marks the completion of that particular job part\. If there are more job parts, the next job part is being prepared to be shipped out\.

You can monitor the status of all your jobs and job parts from the [AWS Snowball Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/importexport/home?region=us-west-2)\.
