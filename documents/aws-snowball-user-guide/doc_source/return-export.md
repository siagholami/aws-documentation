This guide is for the Snowball \(50 TB or 80 TB of storage space\)\. If you are looking for documentation for the Snowball Edge, see the [AWS Snowball Edge Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/whatisedge.html)\.

The prepaid shipping label on the E Ink display contains the correct address to return the Snowball\. For information on how to return your Snowball, see [Shipping Carriers](mailing-storage.md#carriers)\. The Snowball will be delivered to an AWS sorting facility and forwarded to the AWS data center\. Your region's carrier will automatically report back a tracking number for your job to the AWS Snowball Management Console\. You can access that tracking number, and also a link to the tracking website, by viewing the job's status details in the console\.

**Important**  
Unless personally instructed otherwise by AWS, never affix a separate shipping label to the Snowball\. Always use the shipping label that is displayed on the Snowball's E Ink display\.

When your region's carrier gets the Snowball, the status for the job becomes **In transit to AWS**\. At this point, if your export job has more job parts, the next job part enters the **Preparing Snowball** status\.
