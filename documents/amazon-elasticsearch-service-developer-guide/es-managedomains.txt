Managing Amazon Elasticsearch Service Domains
As the size and number of documents in your Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) domain grow and as network traffic increases, you likely will need to update the configuration of your Elasticsearch cluster. To know when it's time to reconfigure your domain, you need to monitor domain metrics. You might also need to audit data-related API calls to your domain or assign tags to your domain. This section describes how to perform these and other tasks related to managing your domains.

About Configuration Changes
Amazon ES uses a blue/green deployment process when updating domains. Blue/green typically refers to the practice of running two production environments, one live and one idle, and switching the two as you make software changes. In the case of Amazon ES, it refers to the practice of creating a new environment for domain updates and routing users to the new environment after those updates are complete. The practice minimizes downtime and maintains the original environment in the event that deployment to the new environment is unsuccessful.
The following operations cause blue/green deployments:
 Changing instance type
 If your domain doesn't have dedicated master nodes, changing data instance count
 Enabling or disabling dedicated master nodes
 Changing dedicated master node count
 Enabling or disabling Multi-AZ
 Changing storage type, volume type, or volume size
 Choosing different VPC subnets
 Adding or removing VPC security groups
 Enabling or disabling Amazon Cognito authentication for Kibana
 Choosing a different Amazon Cognito user pool or identity pool
 Modifying advanced settings
 Enabling or disabling the publication of error logs or slow logs to CloudWatch
 Upgrading to a new Elasticsearch version
 Enabling or disabling Require HTTPS
In most cases, the following operations do not cause blue/green deployments:
 Changing access policy
 Changing the automated snapshot hour
 If your domain has dedicated master nodes, changing data instance count
There are some exceptions. For example, if you haven't reconfigured your domain since the launch of three Availability Zone support, Amazon ES might perform a one-time blue/green deployment to redistribute your dedicated master nodes across Availability Zones.
If you initiate a configuration change, the domain state changes to Processing while Amazon ES creates a new environment with the latest service software. During certain service software updates, the state remains Active. In both cases, you can review the cluster health and Amazon CloudWatch metrics and see that the number of nodes in the cluster temporarily increases—often doubling—while the domain update occurs. In the following illustration, you can see the number of nodes doubling from 11 to 22 during a configuration change and returning to 11 when the update is complete.

This temporary increase can strain the cluster's dedicated master nodes, which suddenly might have many more nodes to manage. It's important to maintain sufficient capacity on dedicated master nodes to handle the overhead that is associated with these blue/green deployments.
Important
You do not incur any additional charges during configuration changes and service maintenance. You are billed only for the number of nodes that you request for your cluster. For specifics, see Charges for Configuration Changes.
To prevent overloading dedicated master nodes, you can monitor usage with the Amazon CloudWatch metrics. For recommended maximum values, see Recommended CloudWatch Alarms.
Charges for Configuration Changes
If you change the configuration for a domain, Amazon ES creates a new cluster as described in About Configuration Changes. During the migration of old to new, you incur the following charges:
 If you change the instance type, you are charged for both clusters for the first hour. After the first hour, you are charged only for the new cluster.
Example: You change the configuration from three m3.xlarge instances to four m4.large instances. For the first hour, you are charged for both clusters (3 * m3.xlarge  4 * m4.large). After the first hour, you are charged only for the new cluster (4 * m4.large).
 If you don’t change the instance type, you are charged only for the largest cluster for the first hour. After the first hour, you are charged only for the new cluster.
Example: You change the configuration from six m3.xlarge instances to three m3.xlarge instances. For the first hour, you are charged for the largest cluster (6 * m3.xlarge). After the first hour, you are charged only for the new cluster (3 * m3.xlarge).
Service Software Updates
Note
Service software updates differ from Elasticsearch version upgrades. For information about upgrading to a later version of Elasticsearch, see Upgrading Elasticsearch.
Amazon ES regularly releases system software updates that add features or otherwise improve your domains. The console is the easiest way to see if an update is available. When new service software becomes available, you can request an update to your domain and benefit from new features more quickly. You might also want to start the update at a low traffic time.
Some updates are required. Others are optional.
 If you take no action on required updates, we still update the service software automatically after a certain timeframe (typically two weeks).
 If the console does not include an automatic deployment date, the update is optional.
Your domain might be ineligible for a service software update if it is in any of the states that are shown in the following table.



State
Description




Domain in processing
The domain is in the middle of a configuration change. Check update eligibility after the operation completes.


Red cluster status
One or more indices in the cluster is red. For troubleshooting steps, see Red Cluster Status.


High error rate
The Elasticsearch cluster is returning a large number of 5xx errors when attempting to process requests. This problem is usually the result of too many simultaneous read or write requests. Consider reducing traffic to the cluster or scaling your domain.


Split brain
Split brain means that your Elasticsearch cluster has more than one master node and has split into two clusters that never will rejoin on their own. You can avoid split brain by using the recommended number of dedicated master nodes. For help recovering from split brain, contact AWS Support.


Amazon Cognito integration issue
Your domain uses authentication for Kibana, and Amazon ES can't find one or more Amazon Cognito resources. This problem usually occurs if the Amazon Cognito user pool is missing. To correct the issue, recreate the missing resource and configure the Amazon ES domain to use it.


Other Amazon ES service issue
Issues with Amazon ES itself might cause your domain to display as ineligible for an update. If none of the previous conditions apply to your domain and the problem persists for more than a day, contact AWS Support.



To request a service software update (console)


Go to https://aws.amazon.com, and then choose Sign In to the Console.


Under Analytics, choose Elasticsearch Service.


In the navigation pane, under My domains, choose the domain that you want to update.


For Service software release, use the documentation link to compare your current version to the latest version. Then choose Update.


To request a service software update (AWS CLI and AWS SDKs)
You can use the following commands to see if an update is available, check upgrade eligibility, and request an update:
 describe-elasticsearch-domain (DescribeElasticsearchDomain)
 start-elasticsearch-service-software-update (StartElasticsearchServiceSoftwareUpdate)
For more information, see the AWS CLI Command Reference and Amazon Elasticsearch Service Configuration API Reference.
Tip
After requesting an update, you might have a narrow window of time in which you can cancel it. Use the console or stop-elasticsearch-service-software-update (StopElasticsearchServiceSoftwareUpdate) command.
Configuring a Multi-AZ Domain
Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area with multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. To prevent data loss and minimize cluster downtime in the event of a service disruption, you can distribute nodes across two or three Availability Zones in the same Region, a configuration known as Multi-AZ.
For domains that run production workloads, we recommend the following configuration:
 Choose a Region that supports three Availability Zones with Amazon ES:
   US East (N. Virginia, Ohio)
   US West (Oregon)
   EU (Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Paris)
   Asia Pacific (Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo)
   China (Ningxia)
 Deploy the domain across three zones.
 Choose current-generation instance types for dedicated master nodes and data nodes.
 Use three dedicated master nodes and at least three data nodes.
 Create at least one replica for each index in your cluster.
The rest of this section provides explanations for and context around these recommendations.
Shard Distribution
If you enable Multi-AZ, you should create at least one replica for each index in your cluster. Without replicas, Amazon ES can't distribute copies of your data to other Availability Zones, which largely defeats the purpose of Multi-AZ. Fortunately, the default configuration for any index is a replica count of 1. As the following diagram shows, Amazon ES makes a best effort to distribute primary shards and their corresponding replica shards to different zones.

In addition to distributing shards by Availability Zone, Amazon ES distributes them by node. Still, certain domain configurations can result in imbalanced shard counts. Consider the following domain:
 5 data nodes
 5 primary shards
 2 replicas
 3 Availability Zones
In this situation, Amazon ES has to overload one node in order to distribute the primary and replica shards across the zones, as shown in the following diagram.

To avoid these kinds of situations, which can strain individual nodes and hurt performance, we recommend that you choose an instance count that is a multiple of three if you plan to have two or more replicas per index.
Dedicated Master Node Distribution
Even if you select two Availability Zones when configuring your domain, Amazon ES automatically distributes dedicated master nodes across three Availability Zones. This distribution helps prevent cluster downtime if a zone experiences a service disruption. If you use the recommended three dedicated master nodes and one Availability Zone goes down, your cluster still has a quorum (2) of dedicated master nodes and can elect a new master. The following diagram demonstrates this configuration.

This automatic distribution has some notable exceptions:
 If you choose an older-generation instance type that is not available in three Availability Zones, the following scenarios apply:
   If you chose three Availability Zones for the domain, Amazon ES throws an error. Choose a different instance type, and try again.
   If you chose two Availability Zones for the domain, Amazon ES distributes the dedicated master nodes across two zones.
 Not all AWS Regions have three Availability Zones. In these Regions, you can only configure a domain to use two zones (and Amazon ES can only distribute dedicated master nodes across two zones). For the list of Regions that support three Availability Zones, see Configuring a Multi-AZ Domain.
Availability Zone Disruptions
Availability Zone disruptions are rare, but do occur. The following table lists different Multi-AZ configurations and behaviors during a disruption.



Number of Availability Zones in a Region
Number of Availability Zones That You Chose
Number of Dedicated Master Nodes
Behavior if One Availability Zone Experiences a Disruption




2 or more
2
0
Downtime. Your cluster loses half of its data nodes and must replace at least one in the remaining Availability Zone before it can elect a master.


2
2
3
50/50 chance of downtime. Amazon ES distributes two dedicated master nodes into one Availability Zone and one into the other: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


3 or more
2
3
No downtime. Amazon ES automatically distributes the dedicated master nodes across three Availability Zones, so the remaining two dedicated master nodes can elect a master.


3 or more
3
0
No downtime. Roughly two-thirds of your data nodes are still available to elect a master.


3 or more
3
3
No downtime. The remaining two dedicated master nodes can elect a master.



In all configurations, regardless of the cause, node failures can cause the cluster's remaining data nodes to experience a period of increased load while Amazon ES automatically configures new nodes to replace the now-missing ones.
For example, in the event of an Availability Zone disruption in a three-zone configuration, two-thirds as many data nodes have to process just as many requests to the cluster. As they process these requests, the remaining nodes are also replicating shards onto new nodes as they come online, which can further impact performance. If availability is critical to your workload, consider adding resources to your cluster to alleviate this concern.
Note
Amazon ES manages Multi-AZ domains transparently, so you can't manually simulate Availability Zone disruptions.
Interpreting Health Dashboards
The Instance health tab in the Amazon ES console uses box charts to provide at-a-glance visibility into the health of each Elasticsearch node.

 Each colored box shows the range of values for the node over the specified time period.
 Blue boxes represent values that are consistent with other nodes. Red boxes represent outliers.
 The white line within each box shows the node's current value.
 The “whiskers” on either side of each box show the minimum and maximum values for all nodes over the time period.
Monitoring Cluster Metrics and Statistics with Amazon CloudWatch (Console)
Amazon ES domains send performance metrics to Amazon CloudWatch every minute. If you use General Purpose or Magnetic EBS volumes, the EBS volume metrics update only every five minutes. To view these metrics, use the Cluster health and Instance health tabs in the Amazon Elasticsearch Service console. The metrics are provided at no extra charge.
If you make configuration changes to your domain, the list of individual instances in the Cluster health and Instance health tabs often double in size for a brief period before returning to the correct number. For an explanation of this behavior, see About Configuration Changes.
Amazon ES metrics fall into these categories:
 Cluster Metrics
 Dedicated Master Node Metrics
 EBS Volume Metrics
 Instance Metrics
 UltraWarm Metrics
 Alerting Metrics
 SQL Metrics
Note
The service archives metrics for two weeks before discarding them.
Cluster Metrics
The AWS/ES namespace includes the following metrics for clusters.



Metric
Description




ClusterStatus.green
A value of 1 indicates that all index shards are allocated to nodes in the cluster. Relevant statistics: Maximum


ClusterStatus.yellow
A value of 1 indicates that the primary shards for all indices are allocated to nodes in the cluster, but replica shards for at least one index are not. For more information, see Yellow Cluster Status.Relevant statistics: Maximum


ClusterStatus.red
A value of 1 indicates that the primary and replica shards for at least one index are not allocated to nodes in the cluster. For more information, see Red Cluster Status. Relevant statistics: Maximum


Nodes
The number of nodes in the Amazon ES cluster, including dedicated master nodes and UltraWarm nodes. For more information, see About Configuration Changes. Relevant statistics: Maximum


SearchableDocuments
The total number of searchable documents across all data nodes in the cluster. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum, Average


DeletedDocuments
The total number of documents marked for deletion across all data nodes in the cluster. These documents no longer appear in search results, but Elasticsearch only removes deleted documents from disk during segment merges. This metric increases after delete requests and decreases after segment merges. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum, Average


CPUUtilization
The percentage of CPU usage for data nodes in the cluster. Maximum shows the node with the highest CPU usage. Average represents all nodes in the cluster. This metric is also available for individual nodes. Relevant statistics: Maximum, Average


FreeStorageSpace
The free space for data nodes in the cluster. Sum shows total free space for the cluster, but you must leave the period at one minute to get an accurate value. Minimum and Maximum show the nodes with the most and least free space, respectively. This metric is also available for individual nodes. Amazon ES throws a ClusterBlockException when this metric reaches 0. To recover, you must either delete indices, add larger instances, or add EBS-based storage to existing instances. To learn more, see Lack of Available Storage Space. The Amazon ES console displays this value in GiB. The Amazon CloudWatch console displays it in MiB.  FreeStorageSpace will always be lower than the value that the Elasticsearch _cluster/stats API provides. Amazon ES reserves a percentage of the storage space on each instance for internal operations.  Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum, Average, Sum


ClusterUsedSpace
The total used space for the cluster. You must leave the period at one minute to get an accurate value. The Amazon ES console displays this value in GiB. The Amazon CloudWatch console displays it in MiB. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum


ClusterIndexWritesBlocked
Indicates whether your cluster is accepting or blocking incoming write requests. A value of 0 means that the cluster is accepting requests. A value of 1 means that it is blocking requests. Many factors can cause a cluster to begin blocking requests. Some common factors include the following: FreeStorageSpace is too low, JVMMemoryPressure is too high, or CPUUtilization is too high. To alleviate this issue, consider adding more disk space or scaling your cluster. Relevant statistics: Maximum


JVMMemoryPressure
The maximum percentage of the Java heap used for all data nodes in the cluster. Amazon ES uses half of an instance's RAM for the Java heap, up to a heap size of 32 GiB. You can scale instances vertically up to 64 GiB of RAM, at which point you can scale horizontally by adding instances. See Recommended CloudWatch Alarms. Relevant statistics: Maximum


AutomatedSnapshotFailure
The number of failed automated snapshots for the cluster. A value of 1 indicates that no automated snapshot was taken for the domain in the previous 36 hours. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum


CPUCreditBalance
The remaining CPU credits available for data nodes in the cluster. A CPU credit provides the performance of a full CPU core for one minute. For more information, see CPU Credits in the Amazon EC2 Developer Guide. This metric is available only for the t2.micro.elasticsearch, t2.small.elasticsearch, and t2.medium.elasticsearch instance types. Relevant statistics: Minimum


KibanaHealthyNodes
A health check for Kibana. A value of 1 indicates normal behavior. A value of 0 indicates that Kibana is inaccessible. In most cases, the health of Kibana mirrors the health of the cluster. Relevant statistics: Minimum


KMSKeyError
A value of 1 indicates that the KMS customer master key used to encrypt data at rest has been disabled. To restore the domain to normal operations, re-enable the key. The console displays this metric only for domains that encrypt data at rest. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum


KMSKeyInaccessible
A value of 1 indicates that the KMS customer master key used to encrypt data at rest has been deleted or revoked its grants to Amazon ES. You can't recover domains that are in this state. If you have a manual snapshot, though, you can use it to migrate the domain's data to a new domain. The console displays this metric only for domains that encrypt data at rest. Relevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum


InvalidHostHeaderRequests
The number of HTTP requests made to the Elasticsearch cluster that included an invalid (or missing) host header. Valid requests include the domain hostname as the host header value. Amazon ES rejects invalid requests for public access domains that don't have a restrictive access policy. We recommend applying a restrictive access policy to all domains. If you see large values for this metric, confirm that your Elasticsearch clients include the domain hostname (and not, for example, its IP address) in their requests. Relevant statistics: Sum


ElasticsearchRequests
The number of requests made to the Elasticsearch cluster. Relevant statistics: Sum


2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
The number of requests to the domain that resulted in the given HTTP response code (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx). Relevant statistics: Sum



Dedicated Master Node Metrics
The AWS/ES namespace includes the following metrics for dedicated master nodes.



Metric
Description




MasterCPUUtilization
The maximum percentage of CPU resources used by the dedicated master nodes. We recommend increasing the size of the instance type when this metric reaches 60 percent. Relevant statistics: Average


MasterFreeStorageSpace
This metric is not relevant and can be ignored. The service does not use master nodes as data nodes.


MasterJVMMemoryPressure
The maximum percentage of the Java heap used for all dedicated master nodes in the cluster. We recommend moving to a larger instance type when this metric reaches 85 percent. Relevant statistics: Maximum


MasterCPUCreditBalance
The remaining CPU credits available for dedicated master nodes in the cluster. A CPU credit provides the performance of a full CPU core for one minute. For more information, see CPU Credits in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. This metric is available only for the t2.micro.elasticsearch, t2.small.elasticsearch, and t2.medium.elasticsearch instance types. Relevant statistics: Minimum


MasterReachableFromNode
A health check for MasterNotDiscovered exceptions. A value of 1 indicates normal behavior. A value of 0 indicates that /_cluster/health/ is failing. Failures mean that the master node stopped or is not reachable. They are usually the result of a network connectivity issue or AWS dependency problem. Relevant statistics: Minimum


MasterSysMemoryUtilization
The percentage of the master node's memory that is in use. Relevant statistics: Maximum



EBS Volume Metrics

Instance Metrics
The AWS/ES namespace includes the following metrics for each instance in a domain. Amazon ES also aggregates these instance metrics to provide insight into overall cluster health. You can verify this behavior using the Data samples statistic in the console. Note that each metric in the following table has relevant statistics for the node and the cluster.
Important
Different versions of Elasticsearch use different thread pools to process calls to the _index API. Elasticsearch 1.5 and 2.3 use the index thread pool. Elasticsearch 5.x, 6.0, and 6.2 use the bulk thread pool. 6.3 and later use the write thread pool. Currently, the Amazon ES console doesn't include a graph for the bulk thread pool.



Metric
Description




IndexingLatency
The average time, in milliseconds, that it takes a shard to complete an indexing operation. Relevant node statistics: Average Relevant cluster statistics: Average, Maximum


IndexingRate
The number of indexing operations per minute. A single call to the _bulk API that adds two documents and updates two counts as four operations, which might be spread across one or more nodes. If that index has one or more replicas, other nodes in the cluster also record a total of four indexing operations. Document deletions do not count towards this metric. Relevant node statistics: Average Relevant cluster statistics: Average, Maximum, Sum


SearchLatency
The average time, in milliseconds, that it takes a shard to complete a search operation. Relevant node statistics: Average Relevant cluster statistics: Average, Maximum


SearchRate
The total number of search requests per minute for all shards on a node. A single call to the _search API might return results from many different shards. If five of these shards are on one node, the node would report 5 for this metric, even though the client only made one request. Relevant node statistics: Average Relevant cluster statistics: Average, Maximum, Sum


SysMemoryUtilization
The percentage of the instance's memory that is in use. High values for this metric are normal and usually do not represent a problem with your cluster. For a better indicator of potential performance and stability issues, see the JVMMemoryPressure metric.

UltraWarm Metrics
The AWS/ES namespace includes the following metrics for UltraWarm nodes.



Metric
Description




WarmCPUUtilization
The percentage of CPU usage for UltraWarm nodes in the cluster. Maximum shows the node with the highest CPU usage. Average represents all UltraWarm nodes in the cluster. This metric is also available for individual UltraWarm nodes. Relevant statistics: Maximum, Average


WarmDeletedDocuments
This metric is not relevant and can be ignored. Warm indices don't support document deletion, so this metric is always 0.


WarmFreeStorageSpace
The amount of free warm storage space in MiB. Because UltraWarm uses Amazon S3 rather than attached disks, Sum is the only relevant statistic. You must leave the period at one minute to get an accurate value. Relevant statistics: Sum

SQLUnhealthy
A value of 1 indicates that, in response to certain requests, the SQL plugin is returning 5xx response codes or passing invalid query DSL to Elasticsearch. Other requests should continue to succeed. A value of 0 indicates no recent failures. If you see a sustained value of 1, troubleshoot the requests your clients are making to the plugin. Relevant statistics: Maximum



KNN Metrics
The AWS/ES namespace includes metrics for KNN. For a summary of each, see the Open Distro for Elasticsearch documentation.
Tagging Amazon Elasticsearch Service Domains
You can use Amazon ES tags to add metadata to your Amazon ES domains. AWS does not apply any semantic meaning to your tags. Tags are interpreted strictly as character strings. All tags have the following elements.




Tag Element
Description




Tag key
The tag key is the required name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique for the Amazon ES domain to which they are attached. For a list of basic restrictions on tag keys and values, see User-Defined Tag Restrictions.


Tag value
The tag value is an optional string value of the tag. Tag values can be null and do not have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of project/Trinity and cost-center/Trinity. For a list of basic restrictions on tag keys and values, see User-Defined Tag Restrictions.



Each Amazon ES domain has a tag set, which contains all the tags that are assigned to that Amazon ES domain. AWS does not automatically set any tags on Amazon ES domains. A tag set can contain up to 50 tags, or it can be empty. If you add a tag to an Amazon ES domain that has the same key as an existing tag for a resource, the new value overwrites the old value. 
You can use these tags to track costs by grouping expenses for similarly tagged resources. An Amazon ES domain tag is a name-value pair that you define and associate with an Amazon ES domain. The name is referred to as the key. You can use tags to assign arbitrary information to an Amazon ES domain. A tag key could be used, for example, to define a category, and the tag value could be an item in that category. For example, you could define a tag key of “project” and a tag value of “Salix,” indicating that the Amazon ES domain is assigned to the Salix project. You could also use tags to designate Amazon ES domains as being used for test or production by using a key such as environment=test or environment=production. We recommend that you use a consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to track metadata that is associated with Amazon ES domains. 
You also can use tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your AWS account bill with tag key values included. Then, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values to see the cost of combined resources. For example, you can tag several Amazon ES domains with key-value pairs, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost for each domain across several services. For more information, see Using Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management documentation.
Note
Tags are cached for authorization purposes. Because of this, additions and updates to tags on Amazon ES domains might take several minutes before they are available.
