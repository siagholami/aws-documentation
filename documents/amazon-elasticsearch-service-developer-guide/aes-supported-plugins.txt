Plugins by Elasticsearch Version
Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains come prepackaged with plugins from the Elasticsearch community. The service automatically deploys and manages plugins for you, but deploys different plugins depending on the version of Elasticsearch you choose for your domain.

[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
Note
This table is not comprehensive. Amazon ES uses additional plugins to enable core service functionality, such as the S3 Repository plugin for snapshots and the Open Distro for Elasticsearch Performance Analyzer plugin for optimization and monitoring.
