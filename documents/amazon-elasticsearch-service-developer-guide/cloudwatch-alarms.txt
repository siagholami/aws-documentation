Recommended CloudWatch Alarms
CloudWatch alarms perform an action when a CloudWatch metric exceeds a specified value for some amount of time. For example, you might want AWS to email you if your cluster health status is red for longer than one minute. This section includes some recommended alarms and how to respond to them.
For more information about setting alarms, see Creating Amazon CloudWatch Alarms in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
