# Recommended CloudWatch Alarms<a name="cloudwatch-alarms"></a>

CloudWatch alarms perform an action when a CloudWatch metric exceeds a specified value for some amount of time\. For example, you might want AWS to email you if your cluster health status is `red` for longer than one minute\. This section includes some recommended alarms and how to respond to them\.

For more information about setting alarms, see [Creating Amazon CloudWatch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
