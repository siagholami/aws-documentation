# Data Protection in Amazon Elasticsearch Service<a name="es-data-protection"></a>

Amazon Elasticsearch Service conforms to the AWS [shared responsibility model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/), which includes regulations and guidelines for data protection\. AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all the AWS services\. AWS maintains control over data hosted on this infrastructure, including the security configuration controls for handling customer content and personal data\. AWS customers and APN partners, acting either as data controllers or data processors, are responsible for any personal data that they put in the AWS Cloud\. 

For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect AWS account credentials and set up individual user accounts with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\), so that each user is given only the permissions necessary to fulfill their job duties\. We also recommend that you secure your data in the following ways:
+ Use multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) with each account\.
+ Use SSL/TLS to communicate with AWS resources\. Choose **Require HTTPS** when you create domains\.
+ Set up API and user activity logging with AWS CloudTrail\.
+ Use AWS encryption solutions, along with all default security controls within AWS services\.
+ Use advanced managed security services such as Amazon Macie, which assists in discovering and securing personal data that is stored in Amazon S3\.

We strongly recommend that you never put sensitive identifying information, such as your customers' account numbers, into domain names, index names, document types, or document IDs\. Elasticsearch uses these names in its Uniform Resource Identifiers \(URIs\)\. Servers and applications often log HTTP requests, which can lead to unnecessary data exposure if URIs contain sensitive information\.
