# Getting Started with Amazon Elasticsearch Service<a name="es-gsg"></a>

This tutorial shows you how to use Amazon Elasticsearch Service \(Amazon ES\) to create and configure a test domain\. An Amazon ES domain is synonymous with an Elasticsearch cluster\. Domains are clusters with the settings, instance types, instance counts, and storage resources that you specify\.

The tutorial walks you through the basic steps to get a domain up and running quickly\. For more detailed information, see [Creating and Managing Amazon Elasticsearch Service Domains](es-createupdatedomains.md) and the other topics within this guide\. For information on migrating to Amazon ES from a self\-managed Elasticsearch cluster, see [Migrating to Amazon Elasticsearch Service](migration.md)\.

You can complete the following steps by using the Amazon ES console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK:

1. [Create an Amazon ES domain](es-gsg-create-domain.md)

1. [Upload data to an Amazon ES domain for indexing](es-gsg-upload-data.md)

1. [Search documents in an Amazon ES domain](es-gsg-search.md)

1. [Delete an Amazon ES domain](es-gsg-deleting.md)

For information about installing and setting up the AWS CLI, see the [AWS Command Line Interface User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)\.
