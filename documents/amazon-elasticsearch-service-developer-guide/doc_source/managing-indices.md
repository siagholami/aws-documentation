# Managing Indices<a name="managing-indices"></a>

After you add data to Amazon Elasticsearch Service, you often need to reindex that data, work with index aliases, move an index to more cost\-effective storage, or delete it altogether\. This chapter covers UltraWarm storage and Index State Management\. For information on the Elasticsearch index APIs, see the [Open Distro for Elasticsearch documentation](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/elasticsearch/reindex-data/)\.
