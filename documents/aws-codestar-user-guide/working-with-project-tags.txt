Working with Project Tags in AWS CodeStar
You can associate tags with projects in AWS CodeStar. Tags can help you manage your projects. For example, you might add a tag with a key of Release and a value of Beta to any project your organization is working on for a beta release.
Add a Tag to a Project


With the project open in the AWS CodeStar console, in the navigation pane, choose Project.


For Create new tag, in Key, enter the tag's name. In Value, enter the tag's value.


Choose Add tag.


Remove a Tag from a Project


With the project open in the AWS CodeStar console, in the navigation pane, choose Project.


In Tags, for Current tags, find the tag you want to remove.


In the Options column for that tag, choose Remove.
Note
You have approximately three seconds to undo the remove operation. To keep the tag, choose Undo.
Otherwise, the tag is permanently deleted.


Get a List of Tags for a Project
Use the AWS CLI to run the AWS CodeStar list-tags-for-project command, specifying the name of the project:
aws codestar list-tags-for-project --id my-first-projec
If successful, a list of tags appears in the output, similar to the following:
{
  "tags": { 
    "Release": "Beta" 
  }
}
