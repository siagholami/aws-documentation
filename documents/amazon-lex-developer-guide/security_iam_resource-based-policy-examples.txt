Amazon Lex Resource-Based Policy Example
Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that specify what actions a specified principal can perform on the Amazon Lex resource and under what conditions. To learn how to create a bot, see Getting Started with Amazon Lex.
Allow a User to Manage a Specific Bot
The following permissions policy grants the user permissions to build and test a pizza ordering bot. It allows the user to use only the OrderPizza intent and Toppings slot type when editing the bot in the us-east-2 Region. 
The Condition block uses the ForAllValues:StringEqualsIfExists condition and the Amazon Lex lex:associatedIntents and lex:associatedSlotType condition keys to limit the intent and slot types that the user can use for this bot.
