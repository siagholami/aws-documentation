Built-in Slot Types
Amazon Lex supports built-in slot types from the Alexa Skills Kit. You can create slots of these types in your intents. This eliminates the need to create enumeration values for commonly used slot data such as date, time, and location. Built-in slot types do not have versions. 
For a list of available built-in slot types, see the Slot Type Reference in the Alexa Skills Kit documentation. 
Note
Amazon Lex doesn't support the AMAZON.LITERAL or the AMAZON.SearchQuery built-in slot types. 
Amazon Lex extends the AMAZON.NUMBER and AMAZON.TIME slot types. See below for more information.
In addition to the Alexa Skills Kit slot types, Amazon Lex supports the following built-in slot types. Slot types marked "Developer Preview" are in preview and might change.
