Alexa Skills Kit Slot Types
You can use any of the slot types from the Alexa Skills Kit in your Amazon Lex bots. To use one of the slot types, specify the slot type name in the console or in a call to the PutIntent operation. For a list of available built-in slot types, see Slot Type Reference in the Alexa Skills Kit.
Note
Amazon Lex doesn't support the AMAZON.LITERAL or the AMAZON.SearchQuery built-in slot types.
