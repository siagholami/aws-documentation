GetSlotTypeVersions
Gets information about all versions of a slot type.
The GetSlotTypeVersions operation returns a SlotTypeMetadata object for each version of a slot type. For example, if a slot type has three numbered versions, the GetSlotTypeVersions operation returns four SlotTypeMetadata objects in the response, one for each numbered version and one for the $LATEST version. 
The GetSlotTypeVersions operation always returns at least one version, the $LATEST version.
This operation requires permissions for the lex:GetSlotTypeVersions action.
