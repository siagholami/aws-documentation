Step 3: Integrate the Kik Bot with the Amazon Lex Bot
Now that you have created an Amazon Lex bot and a Kik bot, you are ready to create an channel association between them in Amazon Lex. When the association is activated, Amazon Lex automatically sets up a callback URL with Kik.


Sign in to the AWS Management Console, and open the Amazon Lex console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/. 


Choose the Amazon Lex bot that you created in Step 1.


Choose the Channels tab.


In the Channels section, choose Kik. 


On the Kik page, provide the following:
    Type a name. For example, BotKikIntegration.
    Type a description.
    Choose "aws/lex" from the KMS key drop-down.
    For Alias, choose an alias from the drop-down.
    For Kik bot user name, type the name that you gave the bot on Kik.
    For Kik API key, type the API key that was assigned to the bot on Kik.
    For User greeting, type the greeting that you would like your bot to send the first time that a user chats with it.
    For Error message, enter an error message that is shown to the user when part of the conversation is not understood.
    For Group chat behavior, choose one of the options:

Enable – Enables the entire chat group to interact with your bot in a single conversation.
Disable – Restricts the conversation to one user in the chat group.


    Choose Activate to create the association and link it to the Kik bot.
