Configuring Conversation Logs
You enable and disable conversation logs using the console or the conversationLogs field of the PutBotAlias operation. You can turn on or turn off audio logs, text logs, or both. Logging starts on new bot sessions. Changes to log settings aren't reflected for active sessions.
To store text logs, use an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group in your AWS account. You can use any valid log group. The log group must be in the same region as the Amazon Lex bot. For more information about creating a CloudWatch Logs log group, see  Working with Log Groups and Log Streams  in the Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide.
To store audio logs, use an Amazon S3 bucket in your AWS account. You can use any valid S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same region as the Amazon Lex bot. For more information about creating an S3 bucket, see  Create a Bucket  in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Getting Started Guide.
You must provide an IAM role with policies that enable Amazon Lex to write to the configured log group or bucket. For more information, see Creating an IAM Role and Policies for Conversation Logs.
The IAM role that you use to enable conversation logs must have the iam:PassRole permission. The following policy should be attached to the role.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account:role/role"
        }
    ]
}
