Built-in Intents
For common actions, you can use the Alexa standard built-in intents library. To create an intent from a built-in intent, choose a built-intent in the console, and give it a new name. The new intent has the configuration of the base intent, such as the sample utterances and slots. 
For a list of built-in intents, see Standard Built-in Intents in the Alexa Skills Kit.
