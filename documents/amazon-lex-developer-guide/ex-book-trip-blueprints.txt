Overview of the Bot Blueprint (BookTrip)
The blueprint (BookTrip) you use to create a bot provides the following preconfiguration:
 Slot types – Two custom slot types:
    RoomTypes with enumeration values: king, queen, and deluxe, for use in the BookHotel intent.
    CarTypes with enumeration values: economy, standard, midsize, full size, luxury, and minivan, for use in the BookCar intent.



Intent 1 (BookHotel) – It is preconfigured as follows:
Preconfigured slots 
RoomType, of the RoomTypes custom slot type
Location, of the AMAZON.US_CITY built-in slot type
CheckInDate, of the AMAZON.DATE built-in slot type
Nights, of the AMAZON.NUMBER built-in slot type



Preconfigured utterances 

"Book a hotel"
"I want to make hotel reservations" 
"Book a {Nights} stay in {Location}"

If the user utters any of these, Amazon Lex determines that BookHotel is the intent and then prompts the user for slot data.
   Preconfigured prompts 
 Prompt for the Location slot – "What city will you be staying in?"
 Prompt for the CheckInDate slot – "What day do you want to check in?"
 Prompt for the Nights slot – "How many nights will you be staying?" 
 Prompt for the RoomType slot – "What type of room would you like, queen, king, or deluxe?" 
 Confirmation statement – "Okay, I have you down for a {Nights} night stay in {Location} starting {CheckInDate}. Shall I book the reservation?" 
 Denial – "Okay, I have cancelled your reservation in progress."
 Intent 2 (BookCar) – It is preconfigured as follows:
   Preconfigured slots 
 PickUpCity, of the AMAZON.US_CITY built-in type
 PickUpDate, of the AMAZON.DATE built-in type
 ReturnDate, of the AMAZON.DATE built-in type
 DriverAge, of the AMAZON.NUMBER built-in type
 CarType, of the CarTypes custom type
   Preconfigured utterances 
 "Book a car"
 "Reserve a car" 
 "Make a car reservation"
If the user utters any of these, Amazon Lex determines BookCar is the intent and then prompts the user for slot data.
   Preconfigured prompts
 Prompt for the PickUpCity slot – "In what city do you need to rent a car?"
 Prompt for the PickUpDate slot – "What day do you want to start your rental?""
 Prompt for the ReturnDate slot – "What day do you want to return this car?"
 Prompt for the DriverAge slot – "How old is the driver for this rental?"
 Prompt for the CarType slot – "What type of car would you like to rent? Our most popular options are economy, midsize, and luxury"
 Confirmation statement – "Okay, I have you down for a {CarType} rental in {PickUpCity} from {PickUpDate} to {ReturnDate}. Should I book the reservation?" 
 Denial – "Okay, I have cancelled your reservation in progress."


Overview of the Lambda Function Blueprint (lex-book-trip-python)
In addition to the bot blueprint, AWS Lambda provides a blueprint (lex-book-trip-python) that you can use as a code hook with the bot blueprint. For a list of bot blueprints and corresponding Lambda function blueprints, see Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda Blueprints.
When you create a bot using the BookTrip blueprint, you update configuration of both the intents (BookCar and BookHotel) by adding this Lambda function as a code hook for both initialization/validation of user data input and fulfillment of the intents.
This Lambda function code provided showcases dynamic conversation using previously known information (persisted in session attributes) about a user to initialize slot values for an intent. For more information, see Managing Conversation Context.
