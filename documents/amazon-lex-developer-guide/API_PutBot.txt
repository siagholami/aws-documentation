PutBot
Creates an Amazon Lex conversational bot or replaces an existing bot. When you create or update a bot you are only required to specify a name, a locale, and whether the bot is directed toward children under age 13. You can use this to add intents later, or to remove intents from an existing bot. When you create a bot with the minimum information, the bot is created or updated but Amazon Lex returns the ` responseFAILED`. You can build the bot after you add one or more intents. For more information about Amazon Lex bots, see Amazon Lex: How It Works. 
If you specify the name of an existing bot, the fields in the request replace the existing values in the $LATEST version of the bot. Amazon Lex removes any fields that you don't provide values for in the request, except for the idleTTLInSeconds and privacySettings fields, which are set to their default values. If you don't specify values for required fields, Amazon Lex throws an exception.
This operation requires permissions for the lex:PutBot action. For more information, see Identity and Access Management for Amazon Lex.

URI Request Parameters
The request uses the following URI parameters.
 name  
The name of the bot. The name is not case sensitive. 
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 2. Maximum length of 50.
Pattern: ^([A-Za-z]_?)$ 
Required: Yes
Request Body
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 abortStatement  
When Amazon Lex can't understand the user's input in context, it tries to elicit the information a few times. After that, Amazon Lex sends the message defined in abortStatement to the user, and then cancels the conversation. To set the number of retries, use the valueElicitationPrompt field for the slot type. 
For example, in a pizza ordering bot, Amazon Lex might ask a user "What type of crust would you like?" If the user's response is not one of the expected responses (for example, "thin crust, "deep dish," etc.), Amazon Lex tries to elicit a correct response a few more times. 
For example, in a pizza ordering application, OrderPizza might be one of the intents. This intent might require the CrustType slot. You specify the valueElicitationPrompt field when you create the CrustType slot.
If you have defined a fallback intent the cancel statement will not be sent to the user, the fallback intent is used instead. For more information, see  AMAZON.FallbackIntent.
Type: Statement object
Required: No
 checksum  
Identifies a specific revision of the $LATEST version.
When you create a new bot, leave the checksum field blank. If you specify a checksum you get a BadRequestException exception.
When you want to update a bot, set the checksum field to the checksum of the most recent revision of the $LATEST version. If you don't specify the checksum field, or if the checksum does not match the $LATEST version, you get a PreconditionFailedException exception.
Type: String
Required: No
 childDirected  
For each Amazon Lex bot created with the Amazon Lex Model Building Service, you must specify whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by specifying true or false in the childDirected field. By specifying true in the childDirected field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. By specifying false in the childDirected field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is not related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. You may not specify a default value for the childDirected field that does not accurately reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA.
If your use of Amazon Lex relates to a website, program, or other application that is directed in whole or in part, to children under age 13, you must obtain any required verifiable parental consent under COPPA. For information regarding the use of Amazon Lex in connection with websites, programs, or other applications that are directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13, see the Amazon Lex FAQ. 
Type: Boolean
Required: Yes
 clarificationPrompt  
When Amazon Lex doesn't understand the user's intent, it uses this message to get clarification. To specify how many times Amazon Lex should repeat the clarification prompt, use the maxAttempts field. If Amazon Lex still doesn't understand, it sends the message in the abortStatement field. 
When you create a clarification prompt, make sure that it suggests the correct response from the user. for example, for a bot that orders pizza and drinks, you might create this clarification prompt: "What would you like to do? You can say 'Order a pizza' or 'Order a drink.'"
If you have defined a fallback intent, it will be invoked if the clarification prompt is repeated the number of times defined in the maxAttempts field. For more information, see  AMAZON.FallbackIntent.
If you don't define a clarification prompt, at runtime Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception in three cases: 
 Follow-up prompt - When the user responds to a follow-up prompt but does not provide an intent. For example, in response to a follow-up prompt that says "Would you like anything else today?" the user says "Yes." Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception because it does not have a clarification prompt to send to the user to get an intent.
 Lambda function - When using a Lambda function, you return an ElicitIntent dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.
 PutSession operation - When using the PutSession operation, you send an ElicitIntent dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.
Type: Prompt object
Required: No
 createVersion  
When set to true a new numbered version of the bot is created. This is the same as calling the CreateBotVersion operation. If you don't specify createVersion, the default is false.
Type: Boolean
Required: No
 description  
A description of the bot.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 200.
Required: No
 detectSentiment  
When set to true user utterances are sent to Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis. If you don't specify detectSentiment, the default is false.
Type: Boolean
Required: No
 enableModelImprovements  
Set to true to enable the use of a new natural language understanding (NLU) model. Using the new NLU may improve the performance of your bot. 
When you set the enableModelImprovements parameter to true you can use the nluIntentConfidenceThreshold parameter to configure confidence scores. For more information, see Confidence Scores.
You can only set the enableModelImprovements parameter in certain Regions. If you set the parameter to true, your bot will use the new NLU. If you set the parameter to false, your bot will continue to use the original NLU. If you set the parameter to false after setting it to true, your bot will return to the original NLU.
The Regions where you can set the enableModelImprovements parameter to true are:
 US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)
 US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)
 EU (Ireland) (eu-west-1)
In other Regions, the enableModelImprovements parameter is set to true by default. In these Regions setting the parameter to false throws a ValidationException exception.
 Asia Pacific (Singapore) (ap-southeast-1)
 Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)
 Asia Pacific (Tokyo) (ap-northeast-1)
 EU (Frankfurt) (eu-central-1)
 EU (London) (eu-west-2)
Type: Boolean
Required: No
 idleSessionTTLInSeconds  
The maximum time in seconds that Amazon Lex retains the data gathered in a conversation.
A user interaction session remains active for the amount of time specified. If no conversation occurs during this time, the session expires and Amazon Lex deletes any data provided before the timeout.
For example, suppose that a user chooses the OrderPizza intent, but gets sidetracked halfway through placing an order. If the user doesn't complete the order within the specified time, Amazon Lex discards the slot information that it gathered, and the user must start over.
If you don't include the idleSessionTTLInSeconds element in a PutBot operation request, Amazon Lex uses the default value. This is also true if the request replaces an existing bot.
The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
Type: Integer
Valid Range: Minimum value of 60. Maximum value of 86400.
Required: No
 intents  
An array of Intent objects. Each intent represents a command that a user can express. For example, a pizza ordering bot might support an OrderPizza intent. For more information, see Amazon Lex: How It Works.
Type: Array of Intent objects
Required: No
 locale  
 Specifies the target locale for the bot. Any intent used in the bot must be compatible with the locale of the bot. 
The default is en-US.
Type: String
Valid Values:en-US | en-GB | de-DE 
Required: Yes
 nluIntentConfidenceThreshold  
Determines the threshold where Amazon Lex will insert the AMAZON.FallbackIntent, AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent, or both when returning alternative intents in a PostContent or PostText response. AMAZON.FallbackIntent and AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent are only inserted if they are configured for the bot.
You must set the enableModelImprovements parameter to true to use confidence scores.
For example, suppose a bot is configured with the confidence threshold of 0.80 and the AMAZON.FallbackIntent. Amazon Lex returns three alternative intents with the following confidence scores: IntentA (0.70), IntentB (0.60), IntentC (0.50). The response from the PostText operation would be:
 AMAZON.FallbackIntent
 IntentA
 IntentB
 IntentC
Type: Double
Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 1.
Required: No
 processBehavior  
If you set the processBehavior element to BUILD, Amazon Lex builds the bot so that it can be run. If you set the element to SAVE Amazon Lex saves the bot, but doesn't build it. 
If you don't specify this value, the default value is BUILD.
Type: String
Valid Values:SAVE | BUILD 
Required: No
 tags  
A list of tags to add to the bot. You can only add tags when you create a bot, you can't use the PutBot operation to update the tags on a bot. To update tags, use the TagResource operation.
Type: Array of Tag objects
Array Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 200 items.
Required: No
 voiceId  
The Amazon Polly voice ID that you want Amazon Lex to use for voice interactions with the user. The locale configured for the voice must match the locale of the bot. For more information, see Voices in Amazon Polly in the Amazon Polly Developer Guide.
Type: String
Required: No
