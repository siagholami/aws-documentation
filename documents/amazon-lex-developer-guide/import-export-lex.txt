Exporting and Importing in Amazon Lex Format
To export bots, intents, and slot types, from Amazon Lex with the intention of reimporting into Amazon Lex, you use create a JSON file in Amazon Lex format. You can edit your resources in this file and import it back into Amazon Lex. For example, you can add utterances to an intent and then import the changed intent back into your account. You can also use the JSON format to share a resource. For example, you can export a bot from one AWS Region and then import it into another Region. Or you can send the JSON file to a colleague to share a bot.
