CreateSlotTypeVersion
Creates a new version of a slot type based on the $LATEST version of the specified slot type. If the $LATEST version of this resource has not changed since the last version that you created, Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns the last version that you created. 
Note
You can update only the $LATEST version of a slot type. You can't update the numbered versions that you create with the CreateSlotTypeVersion operation.
When you create a version of a slot type, Amazon Lex sets the version to 1. Subsequent versions increment by 1. For more information, see Versioning. 
This operation requires permissions for the lex:CreateSlotTypeVersion action.
