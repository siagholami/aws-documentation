Create an Intent
Now, create the OrderPizza intent , an action that the user wants to perform, with the minimum information needed. You add slot types for the intent and then configure the intent later.
To create an intent


In the Amazon Lex console, choose the plus sign () next to Intents, and then choose Create new intent.


In the Create intent dialog box, type the name of the intent (OrderPizza), and then choose Add.


The console sends a request to Amazon Lex to create the OrderPizza intent. In this example you create slots for the intent after you create slot types.
