DeleteSlotType
Deletes all versions of the slot type, including the $LATEST version. To delete a specific version of the slot type, use the DeleteSlotTypeVersion operation.
You can delete a version of a slot type only if it is not referenced. To delete a slot type that is referred to in one or more intents, you must remove those references first. 
Note
 If you get the ResourceInUseException exception, the exception provides an example reference that shows the intent where the slot type is referenced. To remove the reference to the slot type, either update the intent or delete it. If you get the same exception when you attempt to delete the slot type again, repeat until the slot type has no references and the DeleteSlotType call is successful. 
This operation requires permission for the lex:DeleteSlotType action.
