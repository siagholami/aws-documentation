Step 4: Set up Amazon Cognito
To manage permissions and users for the web application, you need to set up Amazon Cognito. Amazon Cognito ensures that the web application is secure and has access control. Amazon Cognito uses identity pools to provide AWS credentials that grant your users access to other AWS services. For this tutorial, it provides access to Amazon Lex.
When creating an identity pool, Amazon Cognito provides you with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for authenticated and unauthenticated users. You modify the IAM roles by adding policies that grant access to Amazon Lex.

Sign into the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Cognito console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/.
