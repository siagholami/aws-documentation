Step 2: Publish the Intent (AWS CLI)
Before you can publish an intent, you have to publish all of the slot types referred to by the intent. The slot types must be numbered versions, not the $LATEST version.
First, update the OrderFlowers intent to use the version of the FlowerTypes slot type that you published in the previous step. Then publish a new version of the OrderFlowers intent.
Note
The following AWS CLI example is formatted for Unix, Linux, and macOS. For Windows, change "\$LATEST" to $LATEST and replace the backslash (\) continuation character at the end of each line with a caret (^).
To publish a version of an intent (AWS CLI)

In the AWS CLI, get the $LATEST version of the OrderFlowers intent and save it to a file:

aws lex-models get-intent \
       --region region \
       --name OrderFlowers \
       --intent-version "\$LATEST" > OrderFlowers_V4.json

In a text editor, open the OrderFlowers_V4.json file. Delete the createdDate, lastUpdatedDate, and version fields. Find the FlowerTypes slot type and change the version to the version number that you recorded in the previous step. The following fragment of the OrderFlowers_V4.json file shows the location of the change:

{
               "slotType": "FlowerTypes", 
               "name": "FlowerType", 
               "slotConstraint": "Required", 
               "valueElicitationPrompt": {
                   "maxAttempts": 2, 
                   "messages": [
                       {
                           "content": "What type of flowers?", 
                           "contentType": "PlainText"
                       }
                   ]
               }, 
               "priority": 1, 
               "slotTypeVersion": "version", 
               "sampleUtterances": []
           },

In the AWS CLI, save the revision of the intent:

aws lex-models put-intent \
       --name OrderFlowers \
       --cli-input-json file://OrderFlowers_V4.json

Get the checksum of the latest revision of the intent:

aws lex-models get-intent \
       --region region \
       --name OrderFlowers \
       --intent-version "\$LATEST" > OrderFlowers_V4a.json
The following fragment of the response shows the checksum of the intent. Record this for the next step.
"name": "OrderFlowers", 
       "checksum": "checksum", 
       "version": "$LATEST",

Publish a new version of the intent: 

aws lex-models create-intent-version \
       --region region \
       --name OrderFlowers \
       --checksum "checksum"
The following fragment of the response shows the new version of the intent. Record the version number for the next step.
"name": "OrderFlowers", 
       "checksum": "checksum", 
       "version": "version",
