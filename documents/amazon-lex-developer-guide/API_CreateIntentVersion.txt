CreateIntentVersion
Creates a new version of an intent based on the $LATEST version of the intent. If the $LATEST version of this intent hasn't changed since you last updated it, Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns the last version you created.
Note
You can update only the $LATEST version of the intent. You can't update the numbered versions that you create with the CreateIntentVersion operation.
When you create a version of an intent, Amazon Lex sets the version to 1. Subsequent versions increment by 1. For more information, see Versioning. 
This operation requires permissions to perform the lex:CreateIntentVersion action.
