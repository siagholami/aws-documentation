Exercise 4: Publish a Version (AWS CLI)
Now, create a version of the bot that you created in Exercise 1. A version is a snapshot of the bot. After you create a version, you canâ€™t change it. The only version of a bot that you can update is the $LATEST version. For more information about versions, see Versioning and Aliases. 
Before you can publish a version of a bot, you must publish the intents that is uses. Likewise, you must publish the slot types that those intents refer to. In general, to publish a version of a bot, you do the following:


Publish a version of a slot type with the CreateSlotTypeVersion operation.


Publish a version of an intent with the CreateIntentVersion operation.


Publish a version of a bot with the CreateBotVersion operation .


To run the commands in this exercise, you need to know the region where the commands will be run. For a list of regions, see  Model Building Quotas .
