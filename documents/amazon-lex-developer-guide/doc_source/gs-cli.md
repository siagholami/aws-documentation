# Step 4: Getting Started \(AWS CLI\)<a name="gs-cli"></a>

In this step, you use the AWS CLI to create, test, and modify an Amazon Lex bot\. To complete these exercises, you need to be familiar with using the CLI and have a text editor\. For more information, see [Step 2: Set Up the AWS Command Line Interface ](gs-set-up-cli.md)
+ Exercise 1 — Create and test an Amazon Lex bot\. The exercise provides all of the JSON objects that you need to create a custom slot type, an intent, and a bot\. For more information, see [Amazon Lex: How It Works](how-it-works.md)
+ Exercise 2 — Update the bot that you created in Exercise 1 to add an additional sample utterance\. Amazon Lex uses sample utterances to build the machine learning model for your bot\.
+ Exercise 3 — Update the bot that you created in Exercise 1 to add a Lambda function to validate user input and to fulfill the intent\.
+ Exercise 4 — Publish a version of the slot type, intent, and bot resources that you created in Exercise 1\. A version is a snapshot of a resource that can't be changed\.
+ Exercise 5 — Create an alias for the bot that you created in Exercise 1\.
+ Exercise 6 — Clean up your account by deleting the slot type, intent, and bot that you created in Exercise 1, and the alias that you created in Exercise 5\.
