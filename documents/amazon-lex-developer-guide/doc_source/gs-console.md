# Step 3: Getting Started \(Console\)<a name="gs-console"></a>

The easiest way to learn how to use Amazon Lex is by using the console\. To get you started, we created the following exercises, all of which use the console:
+ Exercise 1 — Create an Amazon Lex bot using a blueprint, a predefined bot that provides all of the necessary bot configuration\. You do only a minimum of work to test the end\-to\-end setup\.

  In addition, you use the Lambda function blueprint, provided by AWS Lambda, to create a Lambda function\. The function is a code hook that uses predefined code that is compatible with your bot\.
+ Exercise 2 — Create a custom bot by manually creating and configuring a bot\. You also create a Lambda function as a code hook\. Sample code is provided\.
+ Exercise 3 — Publish a bot, and then create a new version of it\. As part of this exercise you create an alias that points to the bot version\.
