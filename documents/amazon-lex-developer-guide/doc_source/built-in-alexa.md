# Alexa Skills Kit Slot Types<a name="built-in-alexa"></a>

You can use any of the slot types from the *Alexa Skills Kit* in your Amazon Lex bots\. To use one of the slot types, specify the slot type name in the console or in a call to the [PutIntent](API_PutIntent.md) operation\. For a list of available built\-in slot types, see [Slot Type Reference](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/built-in-intent-ref/slot-type-reference) in the *Alexa Skills Kit*\.

**Note**  
Amazon Lex doesn't support the `AMAZON.LITERAL` or the `AMAZON.SearchQuery` built\-in slot types\.
