Example: Service consumer configures access
Consider the following example, where a service runs on instances in Provider VPC. Resources that are in Consumer VPC 3 can directly access the service through an AWS PrivateLink VPC interface endpoint service in Consumer VPC 3.

To allow resources that are in Consumer VPC 1 to privately access the service (without creating an interface endpoint directly in Consumer VPC 1), the service consumer can do the following:


Create Consumer VPC 2.


Create a VPC interface endpoint that spans one or more subnets in Consumer VPC 2.


Adjust the security groups associated with the VPC endpoint service in Consumer VPC 2 to allow traffic from the instances in Consumer VPC 1. Adjust the security groups associated with the instances in Consumer VPC 1 to allow traffic to the VPC endpoint service in Consumer VPC 2.


Configure VPC peering between Consumer VPC 1 and Consumer VPC 2 so that traffic is routed between the two VPCs.
