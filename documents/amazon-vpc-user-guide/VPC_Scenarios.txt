You can also use a transit gateway to connect your VPCs.



Example
Usage




Centralized router
You can configure your transit gateway as a centralized router that connects all of your VPCs, AWS Direct Connect, and AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections.  For more information about configuring your transit gateway as a centralized router, see Transit Gateway Example: Centralized Router in Amazon VPC Transit Gateways.


Isolated VPCs
You can configure your transit gateway as multiple isolated routers. This is similar to using multiple transit gateways, but provides more flexibility in cases where the routes and attachments might change.For more information about configuring your transit gateway to isolate your VPCs, see Transit Gateway Example: Isolated VPCs in Amazon VPC Transit Gateways.


Isolated VPCs with Shared Services
You can configure your transit gateway as multiple isolated routers that use a shared service This is similar to using multiple transit gateways, but provides more flexibility in cases where the routes and attachments might change. For more information about configuring your transit gateway to isolate your VPCs, see Transit Gateway Example: Isolated VPCs with Shared Services in Amazon VPC Transit Gateways.
