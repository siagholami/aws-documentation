Changing the Network Load Balancers and acceptance settings
You can modify your endpoint service configuration by changing the Network Load Balancers that are associated with the endpoint service, and by changing whether acceptance is required for requests to connect to your endpoint service.
You cannot disassociate a load balancer if there are interface endpoints attached to your endpoint service.
