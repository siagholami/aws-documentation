You can connect your Amazon VPC to remote networks and users using the following VPN connectivity options\.


| VPN connectivity option | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN | You can create an IPsec VPN connection between your VPC and your remote network\. On the AWS side of the Site\-to\-Site VPN connection, a virtual private gateway or transit gateway provides two VPN endpoints \(tunnels\) for automatic failover\. You configure your customer gateway device on the remote side of the Site\-to\-Site VPN connection\. For more information, see the [AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html)\. | 
| AWS Client VPN | AWS Client VPN is a managed client\-based VPN service that enables you to securely access your AWS resources or your on\-premises network\. With AWS Client VPN, you configure an endpoint to which your users can connect to establish a secure TLS VPN session\. This enables clients to access resources in AWS or an on\-premises from any location using an OpenVPN\-based VPN client\. For more information, see the [AWS Client VPN Administrator Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/)\. | 
| AWS VPN CloudHub | If you have more than one remote network \(for example, multiple branch offices\), you can create multiple AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN connections via your virtual private gateway to enable communication between these networks\. For more information, see [ Providing secure communication between sites using VPN CloudHub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPN_CloudHub.html) in the AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN User Guide\. | 
| Third party software VPN appliance | You can create a VPN connection to your remote network by using an Amazon EC2 instance in your VPC that's running a third party software VPN appliance\. AWS does not provide or maintain third party software VPN appliances; however, you can choose from a range of products provided by partners and open source communities\. Find third party software VPN appliances on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results/ref=brs_navgno_search_box?searchTerms=vpn)\. | 

You can also use AWS Direct Connect to create a dedicated private connection from a remote network to your VPC\. You can combine this connection with an AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN to create an IPsec\-encrypted connection\. For more information, see [What is AWS Direct Connect?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) in the *AWS Direct Connect User Guide*\.
