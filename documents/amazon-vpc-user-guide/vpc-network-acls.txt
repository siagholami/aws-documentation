Network ACLs
A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC. For more information about the differences between security groups and network ACLs, see Comparison of security groups and network ACLs.

Network ACL basics
The following are the basic things that you need to know about network ACLs:
 Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL. By default, it allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, IPv6 traffic.
 You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules. 
 Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL.
 You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets. However, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.
 A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules. We evaluate the rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic is allowed in or out of any subnet associated with the network ACL. The highest number that you can use for a rule is 32766. We recommend that you start by creating rules in increments (for example, increments of 10 or 100) so that you can insert new rules where you need to later on.
 A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic. 
 Network ACLs are stateless, which means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).
There are quotas (limits) for the number of network ACLs per VPC, and the number of rules per network ACL. For more information, see Amazon VPC quotas.
Network ACL rules
You can add or remove rules from the default network ACL, or create additional network ACLs for your VPC. When you add or remove rules from a network ACL, the changes are automatically applied to the subnets that it's associated with.
The following are the parts of a network ACL rule:
 Rule number. Rules are evaluated starting with the lowest numbered rule. As soon as a rule matches traffic, it's applied regardless of any higher-numbered rule that might contradict it.
 Type. The type of traffic; for example, SSH. You can also specify all traffic or a custom range.
 Protocol. You can specify any protocol that has a standard protocol number. For more information, see Protocol Numbers. If you specify ICMP as the protocol, you can specify any or all of the ICMP types and codes.
 Port range. The listening port or port range for the traffic. For example, 80 for HTTP traffic.
 Source. [Inbound rules only] The source of the traffic (CIDR range).
 Destination. [Outbound rules only] The destination for the traffic (CIDR range).
 Allow/Deny. Whether to allow or deny the specified traffic.
If you add a rule using a command line tool or the Amazon EC2 API, the CIDR range is automatically modified to its canonical form. For example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18 for the CIDR range, we create a rule with a 100.68.0.0/18 CIDR range.
Default network ACL
The default network ACL is configured to allow all traffic to flow in and out of the subnets with which it is associated. Each network ACL also includes a rule whose rule number is an asterisk. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other numbered rules, it's denied. You can't modify or remove this rule. 
The following is an example default network ACL for a VPC that supports IPv4 only.

If you create a VPC with an IPv6 CIDR block or if you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your existing VPC, we automatically add rules that allow all IPv6 traffic to flow in and out of your subnet. We also add rules whose rule numbers are an asterisk that ensures that a packet is denied if it doesn't match any of the other numbered rules. You can't modify or remove these rules. The following is an example default network ACL for a VPC that supports IPv4 and IPv6.
Note
If you've modified your default network ACL's inbound rules, we do not automatically add an allow rule for inbound IPv6 traffic when you associate an IPv6 block with your VPC. Similarly, if you've modified the outbound rules, we do not automatically add an allow rule for outbound IPv6 traffic.

Custom network ACL
The following table shows an example of a custom network ACL for a VPC that supports IPv4 only. It includes rules that allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic in (inbound rules 100 and 110). There's a corresponding outbound rule that enables responses to that inbound traffic (outbound rule 120, which covers ephemeral ports 32768-65535). For more information about how to select the appropriate ephemeral port range, see Ephemeral ports.
The network ACL also includes inbound rules that allow SSH and RDP traffic into the subnet. The outbound rule 120 enables responses to leave the subnet.
The network ACL has outbound rules (100 and 110) that allow outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic out of the subnet. There's a corresponding inbound rule that enables responses to that outbound traffic (inbound rule 140, which covers ephemeral ports 32768-65535). 
Note
Each network ACL includes a default rule whose rule number is an asterisk. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other rules, it's denied. You can't modify or remove this rule.

As a packet comes to the subnet, we evaluate it against the inbound rules of the ACL that the subnet is associated with (starting at the top of the list of rules, and moving to the bottom). Here's how the evaluation goes if the packet is destined for the HTTPS port (443). The packet doesn't match the first rule evaluated (rule 100). It does match the second rule (110), which allows the packet into the subnet. If the packet had been destined for port 139 (NetBIOS), it doesn't match any of the rules, and the * rule ultimately denies the packet. 
You might want to add a deny rule in a situation where you legitimately need to open a wide range of ports, but there are certain ports within the range that you want to deny. Just make sure to place the deny rule earlier in the table than the rule that allows the wide range of port traffic.
You add allow rules depending on your use case. For example, you can add a rule that allows outbound TCP and UDP access on port 53 for DNS resolution. For every rule that you add, ensure that there is a corresponding inbound or outbound rule that allows response traffic.
The following table shows the same example of a custom network ACL for a VPC that has an associated IPv6 CIDR block. This network ACL includes rules for all IPv6 HTTP and HTTPS traffic. In this case, new rules were inserted between the existing rules for IPv4 traffic. You can also add the rules as higher number rules after the IPv4 rules. IPv4 and IPv6 traffic are separate, and therefore none of the rules for the IPv4 traffic apply to the IPv6 traffic.

Custom network ACLs and other AWS services
If you create a custom network ACL, be aware of how it might affect resources that you create using other AWS services.
With Elastic Load Balancing, if the subnet for your backend instances has a network ACL in which you've added a deny rule for all traffic with a source of either 0.0.0.0/0 or the subnet's CIDR, your load balancer can't carry out health checks on the instances. For more information about the recommended network ACL rules for your load balancers and backend instances, see Network ACLs for Load Balancers in a VPC in the User Guide for Classic Load Balancers.
Ephemeral ports
The example network ACL in the preceding section uses an ephemeral port range of 32768-65535. However, you might want to use a different range for your network ACLs depending on the type of client that you're using or with which you're communicating.
The client that initiates the request chooses the ephemeral port range. The range varies depending on the client's operating system. 
 Many Linux kernels (including the Amazon Linux kernel) use ports 32768-61000.
 Requests originating from Elastic Load Balancing use ports 1024-65535.
 Windows operating systems through Windows Server 2003 use ports 1025-5000.
 Windows Server 2008 and later versions use ports 49152-65535.
 A NAT gateway uses ports 1024-65535.
 AWS Lambda functions use ports 1024-65535.
For example, if a request comes into a web server in your VPC from a Windows XP client on the internet, your network ACL must have an outbound rule to enable traffic destined for ports 1025-5000. 
If an instance in your VPC is the client initiating a request, your network ACL must have an inbound rule to enable traffic destined for the ephemeral ports specific to the type of instance (Amazon Linux, Windows Server 2008, and so on). 
In practice, to cover the different types of clients that might initiate traffic to public-facing instances in your VPC, you can open ephemeral ports 1024-65535. However, you can also add rules to the ACL to deny traffic on any malicious ports within that range. Ensure that you place the deny rules earlier in the table than the allow rules that open the wide range of ephemeral ports.
Path MTU Discovery
Path MTU Discovery is used to determine the path MTU between two devices. The path MTU is the maximum packet size that's supported on the path between the originating host and the receiving host. If a host sends a packet that's larger than the MTU of the receiving host or that's larger than the MTU of a device along the path, the receiving host or device returns the following ICMP message: Destination Unreachable: Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was Set (Type 3, Code 4). This instructs the original host to adjust the MTU until the packet can be transmitted. 
If the maximum transmission unit (MTU) between hosts in your subnets is different, you must add the following network ACL rule, both inbound and outbound. This ensures that Path MTU Discovery can function correctly and prevent packet loss. Select Custom ICMP Rule for the type and Destination Unreachable, fragmentation required, and DF flag set for the port range (type 3, code 4). If you use traceroute, also add the following rule: select Custom ICMP Rule for the type and Time Exceeded, TTL expired transit for the port range (type 11, code 0). For more information, see Network maximum transmission unit (MTU) for your EC2 instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

Determining network ACL associations
You can use the Amazon VPC console to determine the network ACL that's associated with a subnet. Network ACLs can be associated with more than one subnet, so you can also determine which subnets are associated with a network ACL.
To determine which network ACL is associated with a subnet


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Subnets, and then select the subnet.


The network ACL associated with the subnet is included in the Network ACL tab, along with the network ACL's rules. 
To determine which subnets are associated with a network ACL


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs. The Associated With column indicates the number of associated subnets for each network ACL.


Select a network ACL.


In the details pane, choose Subnet Associations to display the subnets that are associated with the network ACL.


Creating a network ACL
You can create a custom network ACL for your VPC. By default, a network ACL that you create blocks all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules, and is not associated with a subnet until you explicitly associate it with one.
To create a network ACL


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs.


Choose Create Network ACL.


In the Create Network ACL dialog box, optionally name your network ACL, and select the ID of your VPC from the VPC list. Then choose Yes, Create.


Adding and deleting rules
When you add or delete a rule from an ACL, any subnets that are associated with the ACL are subject to the change. You don't have to terminate and relaunch the instances in the subnet. The changes take effect after a short period. 
If you're using the Amazon EC2 API or a command line tool, you can't modify rules. You can only add and delete rules. If you're using the Amazon VPC console, you can modify the entries for existing rules. The console removes the existing rule and adds a new rule for you. If you need to change the order of a rule in the ACL, you must add a new rule with the new rule number, and then delete the original rule.
To add rules to a network ACL


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs.


In the details pane, choose either the Inbound Rules or Outbound Rules tab, depending on the type of rule that you need to add, and then choose Edit.


In Rule #, enter a rule number (for example, 100). The rule number must not already be in use in the network ACL. We process the rules in order, starting with the lowest number.


We recommend that you leave gaps between the rule numbers (such as 100, 200, 300), rather than using sequential numbers (101, 102, 103). This makes it easier add a new rule without having to renumber the existing rules.


Select a rule from the Type list. For example, to add a rule for HTTP, choose HTTP. To add a rule to allow all TCP traffic, choose All TCP. For some of these options (for example, HTTP), we fill in the port for you. To use a protocol that's not listed, choose Custom Protocol Rule.


(Optional) If you're creating a custom protocol rule, select the protocol's number and name from the Protocol list. For more information, see IANA List of Protocol Numbers.


(Optional) If the protocol you selected requires a port number, enter the port number or port range separated by a hyphen (for example, 49152-65535). 


In the Source or Destination field (depending on whether this is an inbound or outbound rule), enter the CIDR range that the rule applies to.


From the Allow/Deny list, select ALLOW to allow the specified traffic or DENY to deny the specified traffic.


(Optional) To add another rule, choose Add another rule, and repeat steps 4 to 9 as required. 


When you are done, choose Save.


To delete a rule from a network ACL


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs, and then select the network ACL.


In the details pane, select either the Inbound Rules or Outbound Rules tab, and then choose Edit. Choose Remove for the rule you want to delete, and then choose Save.


Associating a subnet with a network ACL
To apply the rules of a network ACL to a particular subnet, you must associate the subnet with the network ACL. You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets. However, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL. Any subnet that is not associated with a particular ACL is associated with the default network ACL by default.
To associate a subnet with a network ACL


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs, and then select the network ACL.


In the details pane, on the Subnet Associations tab, choose Edit. Select the Associate check box for the subnet to associate with the network ACL, and then choose Save.


Disassociating a network ACL from a subnet
You can disassociate a custom network ACL from a subnet. When the subnet has been disassociated from the custom network ACL, it is then automatically associated with the default network ACL.
To disassociate a subnet from a network ACL


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs, and then select the network ACL.


In the details pane, choose the Subnet Associations tab.


Choose Edit, and then deselect the Associate check box for the subnet. Choose Save.


Changing a subnet's network ACL
You can change the network ACL that's associated with a subnet. For example, when you create a subnet, it is initially associated with the default network ACL. You might want to instead associate it with a custom network ACL that you've created.
After changing a subnet's network ACL, you don't have to terminate and relaunch the instances in the subnet. The changes take effect after a short period. 
To change a subnet's network ACL association


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Subnets, and then select the subnet.


Choose the Network ACL tab, and then choose Edit.


From the Change to list, select the network ACL to associate the subnet with, and then choose Save.


Deleting a network ACL
You can delete a network ACL only if there are no subnets associated with it. You can't delete the default network ACL.
To delete a network ACL


Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.


In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs.


Select the network ACL, and then choose Delete.


In the confirmation dialog box, choose Yes, Delete.

Example: Controlling access to instances in a subnet
In this example, instances in your subnet can communicate with each other, and are accessible from a trusted remote computer. The remote computer might be a computer in your local network or an instance in a different subnet or VPC. You use it to connect to your instances to perform administrative tasks. Your security group rules and network ACL rules allow access from the IP address of your remote computer (172.31.1.2/32). All other traffic from the internet or other networks is denied.

All instances use the same security group (sg-1a2b3c4d), with the following rules.








Inbound rules


Protocol Type


All traffic


SSH


Outbound rules


Protocol Type


All traffic



The subnet is associated with a network ACL that has the following rules.








Inbound rules


Rule #


100


*


Outbound rules


Rule #

*



This scenario gives you the flexibility to change the security groups or security group rules for your instances, and have the network ACL as the backup layer of defense. The network ACL rules apply to all instances in the subnet. If you accidentally make your security group rules too permissive, the network ACL rules continue to permit access only from the single IP address. For example, the following rules are more permissive than the earlier rules: they allow inbound SSH access from any IP address. 








Inbound rules


Type


All traffic


SSH


Outbound rules

All traffic



However, only other instances within the subnet and your remote computer are able to access this instance. The network ACL rules still prevent all inbound traffic to the subnet except from your remote computer.
Recommended rules for VPC wizard scenarios
You can use the VPC wizard in the Amazon VPC console to implement common scenarios for Amazon VPC. If you implement these scenarios as described in the documentation, you use the default network access control list (ACL), which allows all inbound and outbound traffic. If you need an additional layer of security, you can create a network ACL and add rules. For more information, see  Amazon VPC console wizard configurations.
