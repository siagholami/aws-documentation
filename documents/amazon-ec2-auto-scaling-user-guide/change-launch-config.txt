Changing the launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group
An Auto Scaling group is associated with one launch configuration at a time, and you can't modify a launch configuration after you've created it. To change the launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group, use an existing launch configuration as the basis for a new launch configuration. Then, update the Auto Scaling group to use the new launch configuration.
After you change the launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group, any new instances are launched using the new configuration options, but existing instances are not affected. To update the existing instances, terminate them so that they are replaced by your Auto Scaling group, or allow automatic scaling to gradually replace older instances with newer instances based on your termination policies. 
Note
With the maximum instance lifetime and instance refresh features, you can also replace all instances in the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances that use the new launch configuration. For more information, see Replacing Auto Scaling instances based on maximum instance lifetime and Replacing Auto Scaling instances based on an instance refresh.
