When your EC2 instances fail to launch due to issues with your AMI, you might get one or more of the following error messages.
Topics
 The AMI ID  does not exist. Launching EC2 instance failed.
 AMI  is pending, and cannot be run. Launching EC2 instance failed.
 Value () for parameter virtualName is invalid.
 The requested instance type's architecture (i386) does not match the architecture in the manifest for ami-6622f00f (x86_64). Launching ec2 instance failed.
The AMI ID  does not exist. Launching EC2 instance failed.

Cause: The AMI might have been deleted after creating the launch configuration.
Solution: 



Create a new launch configuration using a valid AMI.


Update your Auto Scaling group with the new launch configuration using the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html command.


AMI  is pending, and cannot be run. Launching EC2 instance failed.

Cause: You might have just created your AMI (by taking a snapshot of a running instance or any other way), and it might not be available yet. 
Solution: You must wait for your AMI to be available and then create your launch configuration. 

Value () for parameter virtualName is invalid.

Cause: Incorrect value. The virtualName parameter refers to the virtual name associated with the device. 
Solution:



Create a new launch configuration by specifying the name of the virtual device of your instance for the virtualName parameter.


Update your Auto Scaling group with the new launch configuration using the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html command.


The requested instance type's architecture (i386) does not match the architecture in the manifest for ami-6622f00f (x86_64). Launching ec2 instance failed.

Cause: The architecture of the InstanceType mentioned in your launch configuration does not match the image architecture. 
Solution:



Create a new launch configuration using the AMI architecture that matches the architecture of the requested instance type.


Update your Auto Scaling group with the new launch configuration using the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html command.
