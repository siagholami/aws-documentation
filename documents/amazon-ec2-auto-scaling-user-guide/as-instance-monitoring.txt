Monitoring CloudWatch metrics for your Auto Scaling groups and instances
Metrics are the fundamental concept in CloudWatch. A metric represents a time-ordered set of data points that are published to CloudWatch. Think of a metric as a variable to monitor, and the data points as representing the values of that variable over time. You can use these metrics to verify that your system is performing as expected. 
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling publishes data points to CloudWatch about your Auto Scaling groups. The metrics are available at 1-minute granularity at no additional charge, but you must enable them. By doing this, you get continuous visibility into the operations of your Auto Scaling groups so that you can quickly respond to changes in your workloads. The following sections guide you through enabling them.
Amazon EC2 publishes data points to CloudWatch that describe your Auto Scaling instances. The interval for Amazon EC2 instance monitoring is configurable. You can choose between 1-minute and 5-minute granularity.

Enabling Auto Scaling group metrics
When you enable Auto Scaling group metrics, your Auto Scaling group sends sampled data to CloudWatch every minute. There is no charge for enabling these metrics.
You can enable and disable Auto Scaling group metrics using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. 
To enable group metrics (console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under AUTO SCALING, choose Auto Scaling Groups.


Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group.


A split pane opens up in the bottom part of the page, showing information about the group that's selected. 

On the Monitoring tab, select the Auto Scaling group metrics collection, Enable check box located at the top of the page under Auto Scaling. 

(Old console: On the Monitoring tab, for Auto Scaling Metrics, choose Enable Group Metrics Collection. If you don't see this option, select Auto Scaling for Display.)
To disable group metrics (console)


Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.


On the navigation pane, under AUTO SCALING, choose Auto Scaling Groups.


Select your Auto Scaling group.


On the Monitoring tab, clear the Auto Scaling group metrics collection, Enable check box. 


(Old console: On the Monitoring tab, for Auto Scaling Metrics, choose Disable Group Metrics Collection.)
To enable group metrics (AWS CLI)
Enable one or more group metrics using the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/enable-metrics-collection.html command. For example, the following command enables the GroupDesiredCapacity metric.
aws autoscaling enable-metrics-collection --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
--metrics GroupDesiredCapacity --granularity "1Minute"
If you omit the --metrics option, all metrics are enabled.
aws autoscaling enable-metrics-collection --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
--granularity "1Minute"
To disable group metrics (AWS CLI)
Use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/disable-metrics-collection.html command. For example, the following command disables all Auto Scaling group metrics.
aws autoscaling disable-metrics-collection --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg

The total number of instances in the Auto Scaling group. This metric identifies the number of instances that are in service, pending, and terminating. Reporting criteria: Reported if metrics collection is enabled.



The AWS/AutoScaling namespace includes the following metrics for Auto Scaling groups that use the instance weighting feature. If instance weighting is not applied, then the following metrics are populated, but are equal to the metrics that are defined in the preceding table.



Metric
Description




GroupInServiceCapacity
The number of capacity units that are running as part of the Auto Scaling group. Reporting criteria: Reported if metrics collection is enabled.


GroupPendingCapacity
The number of capacity units that are pending.  Reporting criteria: Reported if metrics collection is enabled.


GroupStandbyCapacity
The number of capacity units that are in a Standby state. Reporting criteria: Reported if metrics collection is enabled.


GroupTerminatingCapacity
The number of capacity units that are in the process of terminating.  Reporting criteria: Reported if metrics collection is enabled.


GroupTotalCapacity
The total number of capacity units in the Auto Scaling group. Reporting criteria: Reported if metrics collection is enabled.



Dimensions for Auto Scaling group metrics
To filter the metrics for your Auto Scaling group by group name, use the AutoScalingGroupName dimension.
Viewing graphed metrics for your Auto Scaling groups and instances
After you create an Auto Scaling group, you can open the group and view a series of monitoring graphs on the Monitoring tab. Each graph is based on one of the available CloudWatch metrics for your Auto Scaling groups and instances. The monitoring graphs show data points for Auto Scaling group metrics if the metrics are enabled. 
The following graphed metrics are available for groups:
 Minimum Group Size — GroupMinSize
 Maximum Group Size — GroupMaxSize
 Desired Capacity — GroupDesiredCapacity
 In Service Instances — GroupInServiceInstances
 Pending Instances — GroupPendingInstances
 Standby Instances — GroupStandbyInstances
 Terminating Instances — GroupTerminatingInstances
 Total Instances — GroupTotalInstances
The following graphed metrics are available for groups where instances have weights that define how many units each instance contributes to the desired capacity of the group:
 In Service Capacity Units — GroupInServiceCapacity
 Pending Capacity Units — GroupPendingCapacity
 Standby Capacity Units — GroupStandbyCapacity
 Terminating Capacity Units — GroupTerminatingCapacity
 Total Capacity Units — GroupTotalCapacity
The following metrics are available for instances:
 CPU Utilization — CPUUtilization
 Disk Reads — DiskReadBytes
 Disk Read Operations — DiskReadOps
 Disk Writes — DiskWriteBytes
 Disk Write Operations — DiskWriteOps
 Network In — NetworkIn
 Network Out — NetworkOut
 Status Check Failed (Any) — StatusCheckFailed
 Status Check Failed (Instance) — StatusCheckFailed_Instance
 Status Check Failed (System) — StatusCheckFailed_System

Viewing CloudWatch metrics
You can view your Auto Scaling group metrics using the CloudWatch console and the command line tools. 
To view metrics using the CloudWatch console
For more information, see Aggregating statistics by Auto Scaling group.
To view CloudWatch metrics (AWS CLI)
To view all metrics for all your Auto Scaling groups, use the following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/list-metrics.html command.
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/AutoScaling"
To view the metrics for a single Auto Scaling group, specify the AutoScalingGroupName dimension as follows.
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/AutoScaling" --dimensions Name=AutoScalingGroupName,Value=my-asg
To view a single metric for all your Auto Scaling groups, specify the name of the metric as follows.
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/AutoScaling" --metric-name GroupDesiredCapacity
Creating Amazon CloudWatch alarms
One purpose for monitoring metrics is to verify that your application is performing as expected. In Amazon CloudWatch, you can create an alarm that sends a notification when the value of a certain metric is beyond what you consider an acceptable threshold. 
Start by identifying the metric to monitor. For example, you can configure an alarm to watch over the average CPU utilization of the EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group. The action can be a notification that is sent to you when the average CPU utilization of the group's instances breaches the threshold that you specified for the consecutive periods you specified. For example, if the metric stays at or above 70 percent for 4 consecutive periods of 1 minute each. 
For more information, see Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
To create a CloudWatch alarm for your Auto Scaling group


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


If necessary, change the region. From the navigation bar, select the region where your Auto Scaling group resides.


On the navigation pane, choose Alarms and then choose Create alarm.


Choose Select metric. 


On the All metrics tab, select a metric as follows:
    To display only the metrics reported for your Auto Scaling groups, choose EC2, and then choose By Auto Scaling Group. To view the metrics for a single Auto Scaling group, type its name in the search field. 
    Select the row that contains the metric for the Auto Scaling group that you want to create an alarm on. 
    Choose Select metric. The Specify metric and conditions page appears, showing a graph and other information about the metric. 


For Period, choose the evaluation period for the alarm, for example, 1 minute. When evaluating the alarm, each period is aggregated into one data point. 
Note
A shorter period creates a more sensitive alarm.


Under Conditions, do the following:
    For Threshold type, choose Static.
    For Whenever metric is, specify whether you want the value of the metric to be greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, or less than or equal to the threshold to trigger the alarm. Then, under than, enter the threshold value that you want to trigger the alarm.


Under Additional configuration, do the following:
    For Datapoints to alarm, enter the number of data points (evaluation periods) during which the metric value must meet the threshold conditions to trigger the alarm. For example, two consecutive periods of 5 minutes would take 10 minutes to trigger the alarm.
    For Missing data treatment, choose what you want the alarm to do if some data is missing. For more information, see Configuring how CloudWatch alarms treat missing data in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.


Choose Next.


Under Notification, you can choose or create the Amazon SNS topic you want to use to receive notifications. Otherwise, you can remove the notification now and add one later when you are ready.


Choose Next.


Enter a name and, optionally, a description for the alarm, and then choose Next.


Choose Create Alarm.
