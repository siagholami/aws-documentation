Sign up for AWS
When you create an AWS account, we automatically sign up your account for all AWS services. You pay only for the services that you use. You can use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling at no additional charge beyond what you are paying for your EC2 instances.
If you don't have an AWS account, sign up for AWS as follows.
To sign up for an AWS account


Open https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.


Follow the online instructions.


Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.
AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign-up process is complete.
