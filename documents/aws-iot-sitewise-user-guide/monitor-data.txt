Monitoring data with AWS IoT SiteWise Monitor
You can use AWS IoT SiteWise to monitor the data from your processes, devices, and equipment by creating SiteWise Monitor web portals. SiteWise Monitor is a feature of AWS IoT SiteWise that lets you create portals in the form of a managed web application. You can then use these portals to view and share your operational data. You can create projects with dashboards to visualize data from your processes, devices, and equipment that are connected to AWS IoT. 
Domain experts, such as process engineers, can use these portals to quickly get insights into their operational data to understand device and equipment behavior. 
The following is an example dashboard that displays data for a wind farm.

Because AWS IoT SiteWise captures data over time, you can use SiteWise Monitor to view operational data over time, or the last reported values at specific points in time. This lets you uncover insights that might otherwise be difficult to find.
SiteWise Monitor roles
Four roles interact with SiteWise Monitor:
AWS administrator
The AWS administrator uses the AWS IoT SiteWise console to create portals. The AWS administrator can also assign portal administrators and add portal users. Portal administrators later assign portal users to projects as owners or viewers. The AWS administrator works exclusively in the AWS console.
Portal administrator
Each SiteWise Monitor portal has one or more portal administrators. Portal administrators use the portal to create projects that contain collections of assets and dashboards. The portal administrator then assigns assets and owners to each project. By controlling access to the project, portal administrators specify which assets that project owners and viewers can see.
Project owner
Each SiteWise Monitor project has owners. Project owners create visualizations in the form of dashboards to represent operational data in a consistent manner. When dashboards are ready to share, the project owner can invite viewers to the project. Project owners can also assign other owners to the project.
Project viewer
Each SiteWise Monitor project has viewers. Project viewers can connect to the portal to view the dashboards that project owners created. In each dashboard, project viewers can adjust the time range to better understand operational data. Project viewers can only view dashboards in the projects to which they have access.
Depending on your organization, the same person might perform multiple roles.
The following image illustrates how these four roles interact in the SiteWise Monitor portal. 

You can manage who has access to your data by using AWS Single Sign-On. Your portal users don't need to access your AWS account. They can sign in to SiteWise Monitor from a desktop or mobile browser using their corporate credentials or AWS SSO user credentials.
SiteWise Monitor concepts
To use SiteWise Monitor, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
Portal 
An SiteWise Monitor portal is a web application that you can use to visualize and share your AWS IoT SiteWise data. A portal has one or more administrators and contains zero or more projects.
Project 
Each SiteWise Monitor portal contains a set of projects. Each project has a subset of your AWS IoT SiteWise assets associated with it. Project owners create one or more dashboards to provide a consistent way to view the data associated with those assets. Project owners can invite viewers to the project to allow them to view the assets and dashboards in the project. The project is the basic unit of sharing within SiteWise Monitor. Project owners can invite users who were given access to the portal by the AWS administrator. A user must have access to a portal before a project in that portal can be shared with that user.
Asset
When data is ingested into AWS IoT SiteWise from your industrial equipment, your devices, equipment, and processes are each represented as assets. Each asset has data associated with it. For example, a piece of equipment might have a serial number, a location, a make and model, and an install date. It might also have time series values for availability, performance, quality, temperature, pressure, and so on. The portal administrator assigns sets of assets to each project. 
Dashboard 
Each project contains a set of dashboards. Dashboards provide a set of visualizations for the values of a set of assets. Project owners create the dashboards and the visualizations that it contains. When a project owner is ready to share the set of dashboards, the owner can invite viewers to the project, which gives them access to all dashboards in the project. If you want a different set of viewers for different dashboards, you must divide the dashboards between projects. When viewers look at dashboards, they can adjust the time range.
Visualization 
In each dashboard, project owners decide how to display the values for the properties of the assets associated with the project. Availability might best be represented as a line chart, while other values might be displayed as bar charts or key performance indicators (KPIs). Project owners customize each visualization to provide the best understanding of the data for that asset.
