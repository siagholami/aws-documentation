Creating assets
You can create an asset from an asset model. You must have an asset model before you can create an asset. If you haven't created an asset model, see Creating asset models. 
Note
You can only create assets from ACTIVE models. If your model's state isn't ACTIVE, you may need to wait for up to a few minutes before you can create assets from that model. For more information, see Asset and model states.

Creating an asset (console)
You can use the AWS IoT SiteWise console to create an asset.
To create an asset (console)


Navigate to the AWS IoT SiteWise console.


In the navigation pane, choose Assets.


Choose Create asset.


On the Create asset page, do the following:


For Model, choose the asset model from which to create an asset.
Note
If your model isn't ACTIVE, you must wait until it's active, or resolve issues if it's FAILED.


Enter a Name for your asset.


(Optional) Add tags for your asset. For more information, see Tagging your AWS IoT SiteWise resources.


Choose Create asset.



When you create an asset, the AWS IoT SiteWise console navigates to the new asset's page. On this page, you can see the asset's Status, which is initially CREATING. This page automatically updates, so you can wait for the asset's status to update.
Note
The asset creation process can take up to a minute. After the Status is ACTIVE, you can perform update operations on your asset. For more information, see Asset and model states.
After you create an asset, see Configuring a new asset.
Creating an asset (CLI)
You can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to create an asset from an asset model.
You must have an assetModelId to create an asset. If you created an asset model but don't know its assetModelId, you can use the ListAssetModels operation to view all of your asset models.
To create an asset from an asset model, use the CreateAsset operation. Specify the following parameters:
 assetName – The new asset's name. Give your asset a unique, friendly name that you can easily identify.
 assetModelId – The ID of the model to create the asset from.
To create an asset (CLI)
 Run the following command to create an asset. Replace asset-name with a name for the asset and asset-model-id with the ID of the asset model.
aws iotsitewise create-asset \
    --asset-name asset-name \
    --asset-model-id asset-model-id
The operation returns a response that contains your new asset's details and status in the following format.
{
    "assetId": "String",
    "assetArn": "String",
    "assetStatus": {
      "state": "String",
      "error": {
        "code": "String",
        "message": "String"
      }
    }
  }
The asset's state is CREATING until the asset creates.
Note
The asset creation process can take up to a minute. To check your asset's status, use the DescribeAsset operation with your asset's ID as the assetId parameter. After the asset's state is ACTIVE, you can perform update operations on your asset. For more information, see Asset and model states.
After you create an asset, see Configuring a new asset.
Configuring a new asset
Finish configuring your asset with any of the following optional actions:
 Mapping industrial data streams to asset properties if your asset has measurement properties.
 Updating attribute values if your asset has unique attribute values.
 Associating and disassociating assets if your asset is a parent asset.
