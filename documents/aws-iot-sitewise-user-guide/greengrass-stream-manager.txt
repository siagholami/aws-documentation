Ingesting data using AWS IoT Greengrass stream manager
With AWS IoT Greengrass, you can run cloud capabilities on local edge devices. You can use the AWS IoT Greengrass stream manager feature to transfer high-volume IoT data from local sources to the AWS Cloud. You can use stream manager in your custom AWS IoT Greengrass solution to ingest data to AWS IoT SiteWise.
Note
To ingest data from OPC-UA sources, you can configure a gateway that runs on AWS IoT Greengrass. For more information, see Ingesting data using a gateway.
