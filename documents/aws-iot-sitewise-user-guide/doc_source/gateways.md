# Ingesting data using a gateway<a name="gateways"></a>

An AWS IoT SiteWise gateway connects to [OPC\-UA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPC_Unified_Architecture) servers to deliver your industrial data streams to the AWS Cloud\. You can deploy the AWS IoT SiteWise connector on any device or platform that can run AWS IoT Greengrass\.

**Note**  
This documentation describes how to set up the latest version of the AWS IoT SiteWise connector, version 7\. For more information and the connector version changelog, see the [AWS IoT SiteWise connector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/iot-sitewise-connector.html) in the *AWS IoT Greengrass Developer Guide*\.

For more information about how to identify and resolve gateway issues, see [Troubleshooting an AWS IoT SiteWise gateway](troubleshooting-gateway.md)\.
