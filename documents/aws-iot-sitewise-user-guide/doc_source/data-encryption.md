# Data encryption<a name="data-encryption"></a>

Data encryption refers to protecting data while in\-transit \(as it travels to and from AWS IoT SiteWise, and between gateways and OPC\-UA servers\), and at rest \(while it is stored on local devices or in AWS services\)\. You can protect data in transit using Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) or at rest using client\-side encryption\.

For more information about server\-side encryption and client\-side encryption, review the topics listed below\.
