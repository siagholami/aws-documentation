With AWS IoT Greengrass, you can run cloud capabilities on local edge devices\. You can use the AWS IoT Greengrass stream manager feature to transfer high\-volume IoT data from local sources to the AWS Cloud\. You can use stream manager in your custom AWS IoT Greengrass solution to ingest data to AWS IoT SiteWise\.

**Note**  
To ingest data from OPC\-UA sources, you can configure a gateway that runs on AWS IoT Greengrass\. For more information, see [Ingesting data using a gateway](gateways.md)\.
