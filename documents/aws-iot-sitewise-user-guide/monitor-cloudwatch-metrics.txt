Monitoring AWS IoT SiteWise with Amazon CloudWatch metrics
You can monitor AWS IoT SiteWise using CloudWatch, which collects raw data and processes it into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are kept for 15 months, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing. You can also set alarms that watch for certain thresholds, and send notifications or take actions when those thresholds are met. For more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
AWS IoT SiteWise publishes the metrics and dimensions listed in the sections below to the AWS/IoTSiteWise namespace.
Tip
AWS IoT SiteWise publishes metrics on a one minute interval. When you view these metrics in graphs in the CloudWatch console, we recommend that you choose a Period of 1 minute. This lets you see the highest available resolution of your metric data.
