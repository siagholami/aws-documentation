Mapping industrial data streams to asset properties
If your asset has measurement properties, you can define the property aliases to map your data streams to those properties. You can also set property aliases so that you can easily identify an asset property when you ingest or retrieve asset data.
This process requires that you know your property alias, such as /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature.
 If you ingest data from OPC-UA servers using a gateway, your property alias is the path to a variable under the Objects node, starting with /. For example, if the path to your variable is company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature, then your property alias is /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature. For more information about OPC-UA information architecture, see Information Model and Address Spacing mapping in the OPC UA Online Reference.
Notes
If you configure a data stream prefix for your OPC-UA source, you must include that prefix in the property alias for all data streams from that source. For example, if you use /RentonWA as a prefix, then the previous alias is /RentonWA/company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature.
Property aliases can contain up to 1,000 bytes. OPC-UA variables paths can contain up to 4,096 bytes. Currently, AWS IoT SiteWise doesn't support ingesting data from OPC-UA variables with long paths.
 If you ingest data from other sources, such as using AWS IoT rules or the API, you define your property aliases. You can define a property alias naming system that is applicable to your device configuration. For example, if you ingest data from AWS IoT things, you can include the thing name in property aliases to uniquely identify data streams. For more information about this example, see the Ingesting data from AWS IoT things tutorial.
Note
Property aliases must be unique within a Region and AWS account. AWS IoT SiteWise returns an error if you set a property alias to one that already exists on another asset property.
If you have multiple OPC-UA sources with identical data stream paths, you can add a prefix to each source's paths to form unique aliases. For more information, see Configuring data sources.

Setting a property alias (console)
You can use the AWS IoT SiteWise console to set an alias for an asset property.
To set a property alias (console)


Navigate to the AWS IoT SiteWise console.


In the navigation pane, choose Assets.


Choose the asset for which you want to set a property alias.
Tip 
You can choose the arrow icon to expand an asset hierarchy to find your asset.  





Choose Edit.


Find the property for which you want to set an alias, and then enter the property alias.



Choose Save.


Setting a property alias (CLI)
You can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to set an alias for an asset property.
You must know your asset's assetId and property's propertyId to complete this procedure. If you created an asset but don't know its assetId, use the ListAssets operation to view all of your assets for a specific model. Then, use the DescribeAsset operation to view your asset's properties including property IDs.
To map a data stream to your asset's property, use the UpdateAssetProperty operation. Specify the following parameters:
 assetId – The asset's ID.
 propertyId – The asset property's ID.
 propertyAlias – The data stream's path to alias to the property.
 propertyNotificationState – The property value notification state: ENABLED or DISABLED. Specify the property's existing notification state when you update the property alias. You can retrieve the existing notification state with the DescribeAssetProperty operation.
If you omit this parameter, the new notification state is DISABLED. For more information about property notifications, see Interacting with other AWS services.
To set a property alias (CLI)

Run the following command to retrieve the property's current notification state. Replace asset-id and property-id with the asset property's IDs.

aws iotsitewise describe-asset-property \
     --asset-id asset-id \
     --property-id property-id
The operation returns a response that contains the asset property's details in the following format. The property notification state is in assetProperty.notification.state in the JSON object.
{
     "assetId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-22222EXAMPLE",
     "assetName": "Wind Turbine 7",
     "assetModelId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
     "assetProperty": {
       "id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-33333EXAMPLE",
       "name": "Wind Speed",
       "notification": {
         "topic": "$aws/sitewise/asset-models/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE/assets/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-22222EXAMPLE/properties/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-33333EXAMPLE",
         "state": "DISABLED | ENABLED"
       },
       "dataType": "DOUBLE",
       "unit": "m/s",
       "type": {
         "measurement": {}
       }
     }
   }

Run the following command to set the asset property's alias. Replace property-alias with the property alias and notification-state with the notification state, or omit --property-notification-state to disable notifications.

aws iotsitewise update-asset-property \
     --asset-id asset-id \
     --property-id property-id \
     --property-alias property-alias \
     --property-notification-state notification-state
