Monitoring AWS IoT SiteWise with Amazon CloudWatch Logs
You can configure AWS IoT SiteWise to log information to CloudWatch Logs to monitor and troubleshoot the service.
When you use the AWS IoT SiteWise console, AWS IoT SiteWise creates a service-linked role that allows the service to log information on your behalf. If you don't use the AWS IoT SiteWise console, you must create a service-linked role manually to receive logs. For more information, see Creating a service-linked role for AWS IoT SiteWise.
By default, AWS IoT SiteWise doesn't log information to CloudWatch Logs. To enable logging, choose a logging level other than Disabled (OFF). AWS IoT SiteWise supports the following logging levels:
 OFF – Logging is disabled.
 ERROR – Errors are logged.
 INFO – Errors and informational messages are logged.
You can also configure gateways to log information to CloudWatch Logs through AWS IoT Greengrass. For more information, see Monitoring gateway logs.
You can also configure AWS IoT Core to log information to CloudWatch Logs if you are troubleshooting an AWS IoT SiteWise rule action. For more information, see Troubleshooting an AWS IoT SiteWise rule action.
