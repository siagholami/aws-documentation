Associating and disassociating assets
If your asset's model defines any child asset model hierarchies, you can associate child assets to your asset. Parent assets can access and aggregate data from associated assets. For more information about hierarchical asset models, see Defining relationships between assets (hierarchies).

You can use the AWS IoT SiteWise console to associate and disassociate assets.
To associate an asset (console)


Navigate to the AWS IoT SiteWise console.


In the navigation pane, choose Assets.


Choose the parent asset for which you want to associate a child asset.
Tip 
You can choose the arrow icon to expand an asset hierarchy to find your asset.  





Choose Edit.


In Assets associated to this asset, choose Add associated asset.



For Hierarchy, choose the hierarchy that defines the relationship between the parent asset and the child asset.


For Asset, choose the child asset to associate.


Choose Save.


To disassociate an asset (console)


Navigate to the AWS IoT SiteWise console.


In the navigation pane, choose Assets.


Choose the parent asset for which you want to disassociate a child asset.
Tip 
You can choose the arrow icon to expand an asset hierarchy to find your asset.  





Choose Edit.


In Assets associated to this asset, choose Disassociate for the asset.



Choose Save.


Associating and disassociating assets (CLI)
You can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to associate and disassociate assets.
For this procedure, you must know the ID of the hierarchy (hierarchyId) in the parent asset model that defines the relationship to the child asset model. Use the DescribeAsset operation to find the hierarchy ID in the response.
To find a hierarchy ID
 Run the following command to describe the parent asset. Replace parent-asset-id with the parent asset's ID.
aws iotsitewise describe-asset --asset-id parent-asset-id
The operation returns a response that contains the asset's details. The response contains an assetHierarchies list that has the following structure.
{
    ... 
    "assetHierarchies": [
      {
        "id": "String",
        "name": "String"
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
The hierarchy ID is the id value for a hierarchy in the list of asset hierarchies.
After you have the hierarchy ID, you can associate or disassociate an asset with that hierarchy.
To associate a child asset to a parent asset, use the AssociateAssets operation. To disassociate a child asset from a parent asset, use the DisassociateAssets operation. Specify the following parameters, which are the same for both operations:
 assetId – The parent asset's ID.
 hierarchyId – The hierarchy ID in the parent asset.
 childAssetId – The child asset's ID.
To associate an asset (CLI)
 Run the following command to associate a child asset to a parent asset. Replace parent-asset-id, hierarchy-id, and child-asset-id with the respective IDs.
aws iotsitewise associate-assets \
    --asset-id parent-asset-id \
    --hierarchy-id hierarchy-id \
    --child-asset-id child-asset-id
To disassociate an asset (CLI)
 Run the following command to disassociate a child asset from a parent asset. Replace parent-asset-id, hierarchy-id, and child-asset-id with the respective IDs.
aws iotsitewise disassociate-assets \
    --asset-id parent-asset-id \
    --hierarchy-id hierarchy-id \
    --child-asset-id child-asset-id
