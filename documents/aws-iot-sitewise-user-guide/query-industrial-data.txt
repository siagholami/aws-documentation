Querying asset property values and aggregates
You can use the AWS IoT SiteWise API operations to query your asset properties' current values, historical values, and aggregates over specific time intervals. You can use these features to gain quick insights or develop software solutions that integrate with the industrial data stored in your AWS IoT SiteWise assets.
You can also explore your asset data live in AWS IoT SiteWise Monitor. To learn how to configure SiteWise Monitor, see Monitoring data with AWS IoT SiteWise Monitor.
The operations described in this section return property value objects that contain timestamp, quality, value (TQV) structures.
 The timestamp contains the current Unix epoch time in seconds with nanosecond offset.
 The quality contains one of the following strings that indicate the quality of the data point:
   GOOD – The data isn't affected by any issues.
   BAD – The data is affected by an issue such as sensor failure.
   UNCERTAIN – The data is affected by an issue such as sensor inaccuracy.
 The value contains one of the following fields, depending on the type of the property:
   booleanValue
   doubleValue
   integerValue
   stringValue

To get the current value of an asset property (console)


Navigate to the AWS IoT SiteWise console.


In the navigation pane, choose Assets.


Choose the asset with the property to query.
Tip 
You can choose the arrow icon to expand an asset hierarchy to find your asset.  





Choose the tab for the type of property. For example, choose Measurements to view the current value of a measurement property.



Find the property to view. The current value appears in the Latest value column.


Querying an asset property's current value (CLI)
You can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to query the current value of an asset property.
Use the GetAssetPropertyValue operation to query an asset property's current value.
To identify an asset property, you can specify one of the following:
 The assetId and propertyId of the asset property that you are sending data to.
 The propertyAlias, which is a data stream alias (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature). To use this option, you must first set your asset property's alias. To learn how to set property aliases, see Mapping industrial data streams to asset properties.
To get the current value of an asset property (CLI)
 Run the following command to get the current value of the asset property. Replace asset-id with the ID of the asset and property-id with the ID of the property.
aws iotsitewise get-asset-property-value \
    --asset-id asset-id \
    --property-id property-id
The operation returns a response that contains the current TQV of the property in the following format.
{
    "propertyValue": {
      "value": {
        "booleanValue": Boolean,
        "doubleValue": Number,
        "integerValue": Number,
        "stringValue": "String"
      },
      "timestamp": {
        "timeInSeconds": Number,
        "offsetInNanos": Number
      },
      "quality": "String"
    }
  }
Querying historical asset property values
You can use the AWS IoT SiteWise API to get the value history for an asset property.
Use the GetAssetPropertyValueHistory operation to query the historical values of an asset property.
To identify an asset property, you can specify one of the following:
 The assetId and propertyId of the asset property that you are sending data to.
 The propertyAlias, which is a data stream alias (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature). To use this option, you must first set your asset property's alias. To learn how to set property aliases, see Mapping industrial data streams to asset properties.
You can also pass any of the following parameters to refine your results:
 startDate – The exclusive start of the range from which to query historical data, expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.
 endDate – The inclusive end of the range from which to query historical data, expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.
 maxResults – The maximum number of results to return in one request. Defaults to 20 results.
 nextToken – A pagination token returned from a previous call of this operation.
 timeOrdering – The ordering to apply to the returned values: ASCENDING or DESCENDING.
 qualities – The quality to filter results by: GOOD, BAD, or UNCERTAIN.
To query the value history for an asset property (CLI)

Run the following command to get the value history for the asset property. This command queries the property's history over a specific 10 minute interval. Replace asset-id with the ID of the asset and property-id with the ID of the property. Replace the date parameters with the interval to query.

aws iotsitewise get-asset-property-value-history \
     --asset-id asset-id \
     --property-id property-id \
     --start-date 1575216000 \
     --end-date 1575216600
The operation returns a response that contains the historical TQVs of the property in the following format.
{
     "assetPropertyValueHistory": [
       {
         "value": {
           "booleanValue": Boolean,
           "doubleValue": Number,
           "integerValue": Number,
           "stringValue": "String"
         },
         "timestamp": {
           "timeInSeconds": Number,
           "offsetInNanos": Number
         },
         "quality": "String"
       }
     ],
     "nextToken": "String"
   }

If more value entries exist, you can pass the pagination token from the nextToken field to a subsequent call to the GetAssetPropertyValueHistory operation.

Querying asset property aggregates
AWS IoT SiteWise automatically computes aggregated asset property values, which are a set of basic metrics calculated over multiple time intervals. AWS IoT SiteWise computes the following aggregates every minute, hour, and day for your asset properties:
 average – The average (mean) of a property's values over a time interval.
 count – The number of data points for a property over a time interval.
 maximum – The maximum of a property's values over a time interval.
 minimum – The minimum of a property's values over a time interval.
 standard deviation – The standard deviation of a property's values over a time interval.
 sum – The sum of a property's values over a time interval.
For non-numeric properties, such as strings and Booleans, AWS IoT SiteWise computes only the count aggregate.
You can also compute custom metrics for your asset data. Metric properties let you define aggregations specific to your operation. Metric properties offer additional aggregation functions and time intervals that aren't precomputed for the AWS IoT SiteWise API. For more information, see Aggregating data from properties and other assets (metrics).
You can use the AWS IoT SiteWise API to get aggregates for an asset property.
Use the GetAssetPropertyAggregates operation to query aggregates of an asset property.
To identify an asset property, you can specify one of the following:
 The assetId and propertyId of the asset property that you are sending data to.
 The propertyAlias, which is a data stream alias (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature). To use this option, you must first set your asset property's alias. To learn how to set property aliases, see Mapping industrial data streams to asset properties.
You must also pass the following required parameters:
 aggregateTypes – The list of aggregates to retrieve. You can specify any of AVERAGE, COUNT, MAXIMUM, MINIMUM, STANDARD_DEVIATION, and SUM.
 resolution – The time interval for which to retrieve the metric: 1m (1 minute), 1h (1 hour), or 1d (1 day).
 startDate – The exclusive start of the range from which to query historical data, expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.
 endDate – The inclusive end of the range from which to query historical data, expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.
You can also pass any of the following parameters to refine your results:
 maxResults – The maximum number of results to return in one request. Defaults to 20 results.
 nextToken – A pagination token returned from a previous call of this operation.
 timeOrdering – The ordering to apply to the returned values: ASCENDING or DESCENDING.
 qualities – The quality to filter results by: GOOD, BAD, or UNCERTAIN.
Note
The GetAssetPropertyAggregates operation returns a TQV with a different format than other operations described in this section. The value structure contains a field for each of the aggregateTypes in the request. The timestamp contains the time that the aggregation occurred, in seconds in Unix epoch time.
To query aggregates for an asset property (CLI)

Run the following command to get aggregates for the asset property. This command queries the average and sum with a 1 hour resolution for a specific 1 hour interval. Replace asset-id with the ID of the asset and property-id with the ID of the property. Replace the parameters with the aggregates and interval to query.

aws iotsitewise get-asset-property-aggregates \
     --asset-id asset-id \
     --property-id property-id \
     --start-date 1575216000 \
     --end-date 1575219600 \
     --aggregate-types AVERAGE SUM \
     --resolution 1h
The operation returns a response that contains the historical TQVs of the property in the following format. The response includes only the requested aggregates.
{
     "aggregatedValues": [
       {
         "timestamp": Number,
         "quality": "String",
         "value": {
           "average": Number,
           "count": Number,
           "maximum": Number,
           "minimum": Number,
           "standardDeviation": Number,
           "sum": Number
         }
       }
     ],
     "nextToken": "String"
   }

If more value entries exist, you can pass the pagination token from the nextToken field to a subsequent call to the GetAssetPropertyAggregates operation.
