What is AWS IoT SiteWise?
AWS IoT SiteWise is a managed service that lets you collect, organize, and analyze data from industrial equipment at scale. With AWS IoT SiteWise Monitor, you can quickly create web applications for non-technical users to view and analyze your industrial data in real time. You can gain insights about your industrial operations by configuring and monitoring metrics such as mean time between failures and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).
The following diagram shows the basic architecture of AWS IoT SiteWise.

How AWS IoT SiteWise works
AWS IoT SiteWise provides an asset modeling framework that you can use to build representations of your industrial devices, processes, and facilities. With asset models, you define what raw data to consume and how to process your raw data into complex metrics. You can build and visualize assets and models for your industrial operation in the AWS IoT SiteWise console.
You can upload industrial data to AWS IoT SiteWise in the following ways:
 Use AWS IoT SiteWise gateway software that runs on any platform that supports AWS IoT Greengrass, such as common industrial gateways or virtual servers. This software can read data directly from on-site servers over the OPC-UA protocol. You can connect up to 100 OPC-UA servers to a single AWS IoT SiteWise gateway. For more information, see Ingesting data using a gateway.
 Use AWS IoT Core rules. If you have devices connected to AWS IoT Core sending MQTT messages, you can use the AWS IoT Core rules engine to route those messages to AWS IoT SiteWise. For more information, see Ingesting data using AWS IoT Core rules.
 Use AWS IoT Events actions. You can configure the IoT SiteWise action in AWS IoT Events to send data to AWS IoT SiteWise when events occur. For more information, see Ingesting data from AWS IoT Events.
 Use AWS IoT Greengrass stream manager. You can configure solutions on the edge that send high-volume IoT data to AWS IoT SiteWise. For more information, see Ingesting data using AWS IoT Greengrass stream manager.
 Use the AWS IoT SiteWise API. Your applications at the edge or in the cloud can directly send data to AWS IoT SiteWise. For more information, see Ingesting data using the AWS IoT SiteWise API.
You can set up SiteWise Monitor to create web applications for your non-technical employees to visualize your operations. With AWS SSO, you can configure unique logins and permissions for each employee to view specific subsets of an entire industrial operation. AWS IoT SiteWise provides an application guide for these employees to learn how to use SiteWise Monitor.
Why use AWS IoT SiteWise?
Benefits
Collect data consistently from all your sources
With AWS IoT SiteWise, you can gather data reliably from multiple facilities, structure it, and make it accessible and understandable without developing additional software. You can index information and metrics about equipment or processes across multiple facilities, so it’s readily available for applications.
Identify issues quickly with remote monitoring
Assess the performance of your industrial equipment remotely, across locations, with AWS IoT SiteWise. You can remotely diagnose a problem and only dispatch technicians when needed to fix issues. You can spend less time coordinating onsite diagnostic activities and let your engineers focus on what they do best: understanding your operations and designing better systems.
Improve cross-facility processes with a central data source
Visibility across industrial facilities lets you streamline operations, and identify gaps in production and waste. With AWS IoT SiteWise, you can create models of industrial processes and equipment across multiple facilities, and then visualize live and historical data through customizable charts and dashboards. Through SiteWise Monitor, you can launch private web applications with your asset data in minutes with AWS. You and your industrial engineers can use these web applications to better understand your operations, improve processes, and reduce waste across your entire organization.
Use cases
Manufacturing
Manufacturing companies employ complex processes on their factory floors. Quality assurance engineers and assembly robots inspect each product at various points in the assembly line, but this often involves manual work and can be subject to human error. AWS IoT SiteWise helps you collect data from manufacturing lines and assembly robots, transfer it to the AWS Cloud, and structure performance metrics for your specific equipment and processes. You can view production line output in SiteWise Monitor to assist in production planning and identify equipment and process deficiencies, production gaps, or product defects. You can also use these metrics to understand the overall effectiveness of your operations and identify opportunities for innovation and improvement.
Food and beverage
Food and beverage industry facilities handle a wide variety of food processing, including grinding grain to flour, butchering and packing meat, and assembling, cooking, and freezing microwaveable meals. These processing plants often span multiple locations with process engineers and equipment operators in a centralized location monitoring processes and equipment. For example, they might monitor refrigeration units, assess ingredient handling and expiration, or monitor waste creation across facilities to ensure operational efficiency. With AWS IoT SiteWise, you can group sensor data streams from multiple locations by production line and facilities so that your engineers and operators can better understand and improve processes across facilities.
Energy and utilities
Companies often deploy their power generation assets in remote areas, far from the technicians who are trained to fix the equipment. When there's an issue, the technicians receive a notification, travel to the site to diagnose the problem, and then make another trip to fix it. With AWS IoT SiteWise, you can resolve equipment issues easier and more efficiently. With SiteWise Monitor, you can monitor asset performance remotely in real time and access historical equipment data from anywhere. This lets you pinpoint potential problems, dispatch the right resources, and both prevent and fix issues faster.
