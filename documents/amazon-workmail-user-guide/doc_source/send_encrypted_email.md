# Sending encrypted or signed email<a name="send_encrypted_email"></a>

With S/MIME, you can send signed or encrypted emails inside and outside of your organization\. After you configure S/MIME in the email client settings, all emails that you send are automatically signed\. Encryption options depend on different email clients and respective platforms\. The Amazon WorkMail web app client is not supported\.

**Note**  
AWS Certificate Manager does not currently provide certificates to sign and encrypt email\. Get the certificate \(`*.p12`\) file from your administrator or a third\-party certificate authority\.

**To configure S/MIME in Windows Outlook**

1. Get the certificate \(`*.p12`\) file from your administrator or third\-party certificate authority and save it to a folder\.

1. Right\-click the file and choose **Install PFX**\.

1. Choose **Current User**, **Next**, select the `*.p12` file, and then choose **Next**\.

1. Enter the password and choose **Next**\.

1. Make sure that **Automatically select the certificate store** is selected and choose **Next**\.

   1. In the **Change Email Security** dialog box, choose **Choose** and select the installed certificate\.

   1. Choose **OK**, select one or all applicable options, and choose **OK**\.

1. If all email recipients have certificates in the Global Address List \(GAL\) or Contacts, then all emails sent are automatically encrypted\. Otherwise, you receive a warning message and can decide to send an unencrypted message or cancel\.

1. Choose **Settings**, **Mail**, **Accounts**, select your account, and then choose **Account**, **Advanced Settings**\.

If you allow **Email encryption cert**, when you send an email, the app loads and validates the user certificate from the Global Address List \(GAL\) or from a contact\.
