# Sending email as someone else<a name="send_email_as"></a>

You can send email as another user or group if your administrator has granted you the **Send As** permission\.

**To send email as someone else**

1. In the Amazon WorkMail web application, on the shortcut bar, choose the mail icon\.

1. On the menu bar, choose **\+ New item**, **New email**\.
**Tip**  
You can also choose the plus sign \(**\+**\) on the tab bar\.

1. Under the **To** field, choose **From**\.

1. For **From**, enter the name of the person or group for whom you are sending the email\.

1. In the contents pane, type your message and choose **Send**\.

The mailbox owner appears in both the **From:** and **Sender:** headers\.

**Note**  
If you have not been granted **Send As** permissions for the person or group you specified in the **From** field, you receive an email message in your own inbox indicating that you don't have the required permissions\.
