You can create both appointments and meetings in the Amazon WorkMail web application\. 

An appointment is an item in your calendar that is only applicable to you\. No other participants are invited\.

A meeting is an item in your calendar that has more than one participant\. As soon as you invite a coworker or schedule a resource with any appointment, it automatically becomes a meeting\. When you create or edit a meeting in the Amazon WorkMail web application, there are extra controls and buttons for meeting invitations\.

You can share your calendar with other users, and open calendars that have been shared with you\.
