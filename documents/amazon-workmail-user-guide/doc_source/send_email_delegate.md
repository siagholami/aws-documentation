You can send email on another user's behalf if they've made you their delegate\.

**To send email on behalf of someone else**

1. In the Amazon WorkMail web application, on the shortcut bar, choose the mail icon\.

1. On the menu bar, choose **\+ New item**, **New email**\.
**Tip**  
You can also choose the plus sign \(**\+**\) on the tab bar\.

1. Under the **To** field, choose **From**\.

1. For **From**, enter the name of the person for whom you are sending email\.

1. In the contents pane, type your message and choose **Send**\.

The mailbox owner appears in the **From:** header, and you appear in the **Sender:** header\.

**Note**  
If you have not been granted delegation permissions for the person you specified in the **From** field, you receive an email message in your own inbox indicating that you don't have the required permissions\.
