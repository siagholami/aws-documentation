# Troubleshooting the Amazon WorkMail web application<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

Solutions to the most commonly encountered Amazon WorkMail web application errors are listed below\.

**Connection loss**  
If you lose connection to the server due to a network error, Amazon WorkMail displays a warning message at the top of the screen\. You cannot retrieve data from the server, but you can continue working with items that are currently open\. In the warning message, the timeout is shown for the next time the Amazon WorkMail web application will try to connect to the server\. To skip this timeout, and immediately retry, you can click the warning message\. If the connection has been reestablished, the warning message is removed, and you can continue working\. 

**Secure connection failed**  
If this message appears when signing in to the Amazon WorkMail web client, update your web browser to the latest version and try again\. For more information about compatible web browsers, see [Signing in to the Amazon WorkMail web client](web-client.md)\.

**Session expired**  
If your session has expired on the server and you are no longer logged in to the server, Amazon WorkMail displays a warning message\. You can return to the login screen, or you can keep the Amazon WorkMail web application open \(without being allowed to open or save any data\)\.

**Mail cannot be saved**  
If your email gets stuck in your outbox and doesn't get sent, Amazon WorkMail displays this error message\. This may be due to a network issue\. Try saving the email again to resolve this error\.

If your Amazon WorkMail administrator asks for email headers to help troubleshoot an email issue, you can copy and paste the email headers from your email to send to them\. For more information, see [Viewing email headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/manage-mailboxes.html#email-headers) in the *Amazon WorkMail Administrator Guide*\.
