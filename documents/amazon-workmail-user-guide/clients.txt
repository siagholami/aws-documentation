Setting up email clients for Amazon WorkMail
Amazon WorkMail integrates with most popular email apps and devices so that you can synchronize your email, calendar, and contacts.
When your Amazon WorkMail administrator invites you to sign in to your Amazon WorkMail account, you can sign in using the Amazon WorkMail web client. You can also set up other email clients for use with your Amazon WorkMail account, such as Microsoft Outlook, Android or iOS clients, macOS clients, or IMAP clients. POP3 clients are not currently supported.
