What is Amazon WorkMail?
Amazon WorkMail is a managed email and calendaring service with strong security controls and support for existing desktop and mobile email clients. You can access your email, contacts, and calendars wherever you use Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or your iOS and Android mobile devices. Administrators can integrate Amazon WorkMail with existing corporate directories, controlling both the keys that encrypt their data and the location where the data is stored.
