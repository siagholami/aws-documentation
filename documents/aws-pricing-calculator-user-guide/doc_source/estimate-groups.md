# Using groups<a name="estimate-groups"></a>

You can organize your AWS estimates by groups that you define\. A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost center, or it can reflect other organization methods, such as by product stack or product architecture\. For example, if you want to price out different ways to build your AWS setup, you can use different groups for each variation of your setup and compare the estimates for the different setups\. You can also generate one estimate for how much running a website might cost you and another estimate for how much running a machine learning process might cost you, enabling you to see the combined estimate for your AWS usage\. 

AWS Pricing Calculator provides estimates for AWS Regions individually\. To generate an estimate for multiple Regions, you must create a group for each Region\. For example, say that you want to compare the cost of running servers in two different locations, such as US East \(N\. Virginia\) \(us\-east\-1\) and Asia Pacific \(Seoul\) \(ap\-northeast\-2\)\. You can generate an estimate for US East \(N\. Virginia\) \(us\-east\-1\) with one group and an estimate for Asia Pacific \(Seoul\) \(ap\-northeast\-2\) with a second group and then compare the two estimates\.

**Note**  
You can't change the Region of a group after you have added a service to it\. To change the Region, create a group and then edit it\. After you edit the group, you can add services for that Region\.<a name="assign-region"></a>
