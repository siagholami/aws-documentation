Step 5: Create Output Groups
In this step, you create the output groups that you identified when you planned the channel. AWS Elemental MediaLive supports different output types. For more information, see Supported Codecs for Outputs.
Important
Typically, you set up the MediaLive channel as a standard channel. The procedures in this chapter assume that you have set up in this way. The procedures therefore refer to setting up an output group with two destinations.
If you will set up the channel as a single-pipeline channel, then your upstream system has only one source. The output group has only one destination.
