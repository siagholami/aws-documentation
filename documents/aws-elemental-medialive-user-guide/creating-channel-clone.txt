Creating a Channel by Cloning
You can clone a channel that is in the Channels list. (You can also clone a channel after choosing Create channel; for more information, see Creating a Channel from a Template.)
To create a channel by cloning (console)


Open the MediaLive console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/.


In the navigation pane, choose Channels. 


On the Channels page, choose the radio button next to the channel name.


Choose Clone.


The Create channel page appears. It replicates all the data from the base channel except for the input sections, which are always empty.

Give the channel a new name and complete the input sections. Change other fields as needed.
