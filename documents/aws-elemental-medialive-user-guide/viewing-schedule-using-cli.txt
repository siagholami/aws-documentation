Viewing the Schedule (AWS CLI)
You can use the AWS CLI to view a list of the actions that are currently in the schedule for one channel:
 Actions that have not yet been executed in the channel
 Actions that have been executed within the last hour 
To view the schedule, you use the DescribeSchedule command. This command is represented differently in different interfaces:
 In the AWS CLI, the command is describe-schedule.
 In the API, the command is represented by an HTTP GET on channels/channelId/schedule.
 In the AWS SDKs, the command is represented by constructs that are suitable to that SDK language. 
To view actions (AWS CLI)

Enter this command:

aws medialive describe-schedule --channel-id value --max-results value


To submit the command, press Enter. The response appears on the screen. 


If you used the -max-results option and the response included NextToken, enter the DescribeChannel command and pass the value of NextToken in --next-token. For example:


aws medialive describe-schedule --channel-id value --next-token 3jhrprd0

To submit the command, press Enter. The response appears on the screen. 

Example
The JSON body of the command response is similar to that of the BatchUpdateSchedule command request.
This example of a response shows the following actions:
 An action with the ActionName "corporate_logo_029" to activate an image overlay in layer 1 at 20:30:00 UTC
 An action with the ActionName "stop_overlay_029" to deactivate the overlay in layer 1 at 20:42:04 UTC
 An action with the ActionName "adavail_3708" to insert a splice_insert at the same time as the deactivate action
 An action with the ActionName "end_adavail_3708" to return-to-network 15 seconds later, at 20:42:19 UTC
 An action with the ActionName "corporate_logo_030" to reactivate the same overlay in layer 1 at the same time as the return
This schedule describes a workflow where you generally show your corporate logo, but you remove it at the start of each ad avail and then display it again at the end of the ad avail:
