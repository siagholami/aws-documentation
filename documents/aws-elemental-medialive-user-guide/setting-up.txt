This chapter includes steps that grant broad permissions to AWS Elemental MediaLive and other services. These permissions are known as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. The permissions are intended to allow you and others in your organization to get started with MediaLive as quickly as possible. These permissions are not suitable for assigning to a wide group of users or for users working in a production environment.
