Creating a Channel from a Template
You can create a channel by using a custom template or by using one of the built-in templates that MediaLive provides. 
To create a channel from a template (console)


If you plan to use a custom template, make sure you have set up to use them. See Using Custom Templates. 


Open the MediaLive console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/.


In the navigation pane, choose Channels.


On the Channels page, choose Create channel. 


On the Create channel page, in the Channel and input details section, in the Channel template section, do one of the following: 
    To use a built-in template: For Template, from the Channel templates section of the drop-down list, choose a template. (The Existing channels section does not list templates.)
    To use a custom template: Choose Select custom template. Navigate to the "custom template" folder and choose the template. For information on the custom template location, see Using Custom Templates. 


Complete the fields, such as the input fields, that must always be completed. You can also edit other fields as needed.
