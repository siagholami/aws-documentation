Working with Reservations in AWS Elemental MediaLive
You can purchase a reservation for the processing of resources that you are billed for: input processing, output processing, and add-ons such as codec licenses. Each reservation gives you a reduced rate for the processing of the relevant resources. 
A reservation is a one-year commitment to a particular input or output configuration. The reservation is allocated and billed on a monthly basis through that year. 
You pay an hourly rate (which is lower than the per-minute rate) for a pool of minutes that your channels consume for a month. 
For information on charges for reservations, see the MediaLive price list.
