Settings for an Archive Output
On the Output page for an Archive output group, you provide information about the container for this output, and the video, audio, and captions encodes to create in that container.
Output Settings Section

For Name modifier, enter a name as described in Archive Destinations.
Leave Extension blank; it is always set to m2ts.
In the fields under Container Settings, optionally change any values. For details about a field, choose the Info link next to the field.
In the fields under PID settings, optionally change any values. For details about a field, choose the Info link next to the field.

Streams Section
In Stream settings, decide if you need to create more encodes for this output, based on the workflow that you planned. By default, each output is set up with one video encode and one audio encode. Choose the appropriate Add button or Delete button to set up the output with the encodes—video, audio, and captions—that you planned for this output.
For example, in one output you might want one video asset and two audio assets, in another output you might want one captions asset for French captions, and in a third output you might want one captions asset for Spanish captions. For information about why you would set up like this (for example, with an output that contains only one captions asset), see Examples of Channel Designs.
For information about the fields in each type of encode, see Step 7: Set Up the Video Encode, Step 8: Set Up the Audio Encodes, and Step 9: Set up the Captions Encodes.
