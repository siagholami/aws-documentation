Use Case B: One Input Format Converted to One Different Format in One Output
The input is set up with one format of captions and two or more languages. You want to convert the captions to a different format in the output. You want to produce only one type of output and include all the languages in that output.
For example, the input has embedded captions in German and French. You want to convert the captions to DVB-Sub and include these captions in both languages in a UDP output.
