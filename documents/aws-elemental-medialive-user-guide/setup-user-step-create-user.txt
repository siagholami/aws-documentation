Step 3: Create or Add an IAM User to Your Group
The procedure in this section shows how to create or edit an IAM user identity. Anyone with IAM administrator-level credentials can perform the procedure. Perform this step for each user.
Note
This procedure shows how to set up an IAM user for console access, but not for AWS CLI or AWS SDK access. To set up for programmatic access, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/. 
Creating an IAM User and Adding the User to Your Group
Typically, you create an IAM user identity for an AWS user only if a person doesn't have an existing identity. If the person already has an IAM user identity, you can modify their access instead.
To create an IAM user and add the user to your group


Sign in to the AWS Management Console as an administrator, and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Users, and then choose Add user.


On the Add User page, for User name, enter a name for the user.


For Access type, select AWS Management Console access.
For Console password, choose Custom password, and then enter a password. 
For Require password reset, we recommend that you select the check box.


Choose Next: Permissions.


On the Set permissions for user page, choose Add user to group.


Select the check box for the MediaLivePowerUsers group that you created in Step 2: Create a Group, and then choose Next: Review.


Choose Create user. 


Optionally choose Send email to send an email to this user. Your local email client opens with a draft email that includes the user name and sign-in URL. 


Choose Close to return to the navigation pane.


Provide the user with their password (it is not included in the generated email). You must provide the password in a way that complies with your organization's security guidelines. 


Repeat the steps to add more IAM users. As an example, the following diagram shows three IAM users that are associated with the same group, MediaLivePowerUsers. 

Adding an Existing IAM User to Your Group
You can add an existing IAM user to a group that you create for AWS Elemental MediaLive, even if the user is already a member of other groups. In this procedure, you add the user to the MediaLivePowerUsers group that you created in Step 2: Create a Group.
For more information about IAM users and groups, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/.
To add an existing IAM user to your group


Sign in to the AWS Management Console as an administrator, and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Users.


In the list of users, choose the user name (don't choose the check box). 


On the Summary page, choose the Groups tab. On the Groups tab, choose Add user to groups, and then select the MediaLivePowerUsers group that you created in Step 2: Create a Group.


Choose Add to Groups.


You now have a setup where an IAM user belongs to more than one group: the original groups and the group that you added. If one of the groups has a policy that gives specific permissions to a given service or resource, and another group has a policy that gives different permissions, the policy with the least permission applies. One situation in which this rule might apply is if the existing user currently has permissions in IAM that are broader than those in the MediaLiveTrustedEntityAccess policy that you created.
