Creating a Channel from Scratch
A channel contains the details that instruct AWS Elemental MediaLive how to transcode (decode and encode) and package your input into specific outputs.
Before you start the process of creating a channel, you should plan your channel to identify the following elements:
 Inputs that the channel will use
 Output groups for the channel
 Outputs (within each output group)
 Video, audio, and captions encodes (in each output) that the channel will produce
There are three ways to create a channel: 
 Create from scratch. See the topics (steps 1-9) in this chapter.
 Use a built-in or custom template. See Creating a Channel from a Template or by Cloning.
 Clone an existing channel. See Creating a Channel from a Template or by Cloning.
