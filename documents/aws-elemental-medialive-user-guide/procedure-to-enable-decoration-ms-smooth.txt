Enabling Decoration â€“ Microsoft Smooth
With Microsoft Smooth, if you enable manifest decoration, instructions are inserted in the sparse track.
Manifest decoration is enabled at the output group level, which means that the sparse tracks for all outputs in that group will include instructions based on the SCTE-35 content.
To enable decoration

In the navigation pane, find the desired Microsoft Smooth output group. 


For Sparse track, for Sparse track type, choose SCTE_35.
