Use Case C: One Input Format Converted to Different Formats, One Format for Each Output
The input is set up with one format of captions and two or more languages. Assume that you want to produce several different types of output, and that in each output you want to convert the captions to a different format but include all the languages.
For example, the input has Teletext captions in Czech and Polish. You want to produce a Microsoft Smooth output and an HLS output. In the Microsoft Smooth output, you want to convert both captions to TTML. In the HLS output, you want to convert both captions to Web-VTT.
