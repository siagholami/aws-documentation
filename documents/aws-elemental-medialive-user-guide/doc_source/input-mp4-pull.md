# Channel Inputâ€”MP4 Pull Input<a name="input-mp4-pull"></a>

To verify that the input is set up correctly, look at the **Input destinations** section\. It shows the locations of the source video\. You specified these locations when you created the input:
+ If the channel is set up as a standard channel, you specified two locations\.
+ If the channel is set up as a single\-pipeline channel, you specified one\. 

The format of the location depends on the type of upstream system:
+ For an upstream system that uses HTTP or HTTPS, the location is an HTTP or HTTPS URL\. For example:

  `https://203.0.113.31/fillervideos/oceanwaves.mp4` and 

  `https://203.0.113.52/ fillervideos/oceanwaves.mp4` 
+ For a file that is stored on Amazon S3, the location is the bucket name and object for the file\. For example:

  `s3://fillervideos/main/oceanwaves.mp4` and

  `s3://fillervideos/redundant/oceanwaves.mp4`
