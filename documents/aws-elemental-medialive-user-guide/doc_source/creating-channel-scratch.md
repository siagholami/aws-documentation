# Creating a Channel from Scratch<a name="creating-channel-scratch"></a>

A channel contains the details that instruct AWS Elemental MediaLive how to transcode \(decode and encode\) and package your input into specific outputs\.

Before you start the process of creating a channel, you should [plan your channel](planning-workflow.md) to identify the following elements:
+ Inputs that the channel will use
+ Output groups for the channel
+ Outputs \(within each output group\)
+ Video, audio, and captions encodes \(in each output\) that the channel will produce

There are three ways to create a channel: 
+ **Create from scratch\.** See the topics \(steps 1\-9\) in this chapter\.
+ **Use a built\-in or custom template\.** See [Creating a Channel from a Template or by Cloning](creating-channel-template-clone.md)\.
+ **Clone an existing channel\.** See [Creating a Channel from a Template or by Cloning](creating-channel-template-clone.md)\.
