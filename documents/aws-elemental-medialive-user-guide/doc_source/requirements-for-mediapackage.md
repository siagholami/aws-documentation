# Requirements for AWS Elemental MediaPackage<a name="requirements-for-mediapackage"></a>

Your deployment might send outputs to AWS Elemental MediaPackage, either by creating an [HLS output group or by creating a MediaPackage output group](downstream-system-hls.md)\. \(Note that both MediaLive and MediaPackage have "channels"; however, they are different objects\.\)

Regardless of the type of output group, users don't need special permissions to specify a MediaPackage channel as the destination for output\.
