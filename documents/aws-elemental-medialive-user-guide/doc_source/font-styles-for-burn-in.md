# Font Styles for Burn\-in or DVB\-Sub<a name="font-styles-for-burn-in"></a>

If the output captions are Burn\-in or DVB\-Sub, you can specify the look of the captions\.

If you are using the same captions source in several outputs and both those outputs use the same format, then you must set up the font style information identically in each output\. If you don't, you get an error when you save the channel\. 

For example, output A might use **Captions Selector 1** with the **Destination Type** set to **Burn\-in**\. And output B might also use **Captions Selector 1** with the **Destination Type** set to **Burn\-in**\. You set the font information once in output 1 and again in output 2\. But you must set up all the font information identically in both outputs\.
