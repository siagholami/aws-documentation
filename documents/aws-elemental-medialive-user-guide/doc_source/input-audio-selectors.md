# Input Settingsâ€”Audio Selectors<a name="input-audio-selectors"></a>

If you want to extract audio from the input, this section is required\. You create one or more audio selectors to identify the audio to extract\. Typically, you identify different languages from the input, but you could also extract different audio codecs \(such as AAC and Dolby\)\.

For each audio that you want to extract, choose **Add audio selector**\. Complete the fields that appear to identify the location of the audio and to specify optional handling of the audio\.
