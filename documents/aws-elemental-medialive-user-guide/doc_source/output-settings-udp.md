# Settings for a UDP Output<a name="output-settings-udp"></a>

On the **Output** page for a UDP output group, you provide information about the individual output container and the video, audio, and captions encodes to create in that container\.

## Output Settings Section<a name="udp-output-section"></a>
+ For **FEC output settings**, choose a value\. 
+ In the fields under **Network settings**, change any values as needed\. For details about a field, choose the **Info** link next to the field\.
+ In the fields under **PID settings**, change any values as appropriate\. For details about a field, choose the **Info** link next to the field\.

## Streams Section<a name="udp-streams-section"></a>
+ In **Stream settings**, decide if you need to create more encodes for this output, based on the [workflow that you planned](planning-the-channel.md)\. By default, each output is set up with one video encode and one audio encode\. 
+ Choose the appropriate **Add** button or **Delete** button to set up the output with the encodes—video, audio, and captions—that you planned for this output\. 

For example, in one output you might want one video and two audio assets, in another output you might want one captions asset for French captions, and in a third output you might want one captions asset for Spanish captions\.

For information about the fields in each type of encode, see [Step 7: Set Up the Video Encode](creating-a-channel-step6.md), [Step 8: Set Up the Audio Encodes](creating-a-channel-step7.md), and [Step 9: Set up the Captions Encodes](creating-a-channel-step8.md)\.
