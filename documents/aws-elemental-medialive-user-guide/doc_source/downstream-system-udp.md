# Setting Up the Downstream System for a UDP Output<a name="downstream-system-udp"></a>

The downstream system is an address that can communicate over UDP or RTP\. 

Set up the UDP destination so that it expects MediaLive output at two inputs, one for each MediaLive channel pipeline\.

Perform the necessary setup at the UDP destination to obtain the following information for each input:
+ URL for the output to send to
+ Port number

Make a note of the URLs and port numbers\.
