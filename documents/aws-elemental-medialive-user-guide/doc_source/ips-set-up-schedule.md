# Setting Up the Schedule with Input Switches<a name="ips-set-up-schedule"></a>

After you create the channel, you must create actions in the schedule to set up the input switches that you want\. For detailed information, see [Creating Actions in the Schedule \(Console\)](schedule-using-console-create.md)\.

We recommend that you add input switch actions to the schedule before you start the channel\.
