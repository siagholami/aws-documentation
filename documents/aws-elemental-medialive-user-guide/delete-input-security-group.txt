Deleting an Input Security Group
You can delete an input security group so long as it is not attached to any inputs. 
To delete an input security group


Open the MediaLive console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/.


In the navigation pane, choose Input security groups.


On the Input security groups page, look at the State for the group to delete: 
    If the State is Idle, choose the group, and then choose Delete. 
    If the State is In use, continue with this procedure. 


Make a note of the ID of the input security group. For example, 1234567.


Choose the group, and then choose Edit. 


On the Edit input security group page, look at the Inputs on the right side and count how many inputs are attached to this input security group.


Choose the first input. Then on the page for that input, choose Edit. On the Edit page, in the Input security group, either create a new input security group for this input or choose another group (make sure you don't rechoose the same group; check the ID that you noted earlier). Choose Update so that this input is no longer attached to the input security group that you want to delete.


If there are still more inputs associated with this input group, then in the navigation pane, choose Input security groups, and repeat these steps to detach this input security group from all the inputs. 


After detaching the last input from this input security group, wait for the State of the input security group to specify Idle. Then choose the group, and choose Delete.
