Use Case A: One Input Format to One Output and Not Converted
The input is set up with one format of captions and two or more languages. Assume that you want to maintain the format in the output, and that you want to produce only one type of output and to include all the languages in that output.
For example, the input has embedded captions in English and French. You want to produce HLS output that includes embedded captions in both English and French.
