Create a User
Typically, you create a new user identity for an AWS user only if a person does not have an existing identity. If the person already has a user identity, modify their access instead.
To create a user


Make sure that you know which group (Step 4: Create the Groups) that you want to add each user to. Make sure that you have already created this group (Step 4: Create the Groups).


Sign in to the AWS Management Console as an administrator, and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation pane, choose Users, and then choose Add user.


On the Add User page, for User name, enter a name for the user.


For Access type, select AWS Management Console access.
For Console password, select Custom password and enter a password. 
For Require password reset, we recommend that you select the check box.


Choose Next: Permissions.


On the Set permissions for user page, choose Add user to group.


Select the check box for the appropriate group for this user, and then choose Next: Tags.


Add tags if your organization has a policy to create tags for users. For more information, see Tagging AWS Elemental MediaLive Resources. Then choose Next: Review.


Choose Create user. 


Optionally, choose Send email to send an email to this user. Your local email client opens with a draft email that includes the user name and sign-in URL. 


Choose Close to return to the navigation pane.


Provide the user with their password (it is not included in the generated email). You must provide the password in a way that complies with your organization's security guidelines. 


The following example assumes that you created three users and associated all of them with the same group, medialivebasicusers.
