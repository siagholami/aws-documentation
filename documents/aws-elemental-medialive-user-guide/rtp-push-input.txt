Creating an RTP Push Input
Create your input before you create the channel that ingests the input. 
To create an RTP push input


Open the MediaLive console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/.


In the navigation pane, choose Inputs.


On the Inputs page, choose Create input.


In the Input details section, for Input name, enter a name.


For Input type, choose RTP. 


In the Network mode section, choose Public.


In the Input security group section, specify a group to attach to this "push" input. You can choose an existing group, or you can create a group. For more information about security groups, see Working with Input Security Groups. 


In the Tags section, create tags if you want to associate tags with this input. For more information, see Tagging AWS Elemental MediaLive Resources.


Choose Create.


MediaLive creates the input and automatically creates two endpoints on that input. These endpoints include the port 5000. For example:
rtp://203.0.113.19:5000 
rtp://203.0.113.131:5000. 
MediaLive always creates two endpoints: 
    If the channel for this input will be set up as a standard channel, both endpoints will be used. 
    If the channel for this input will be set up as a single-pipeline channel, only the first endpoint will be used. MediaLive won't expect to receive content at the second endpoint. 

Provide the upstream system with the following information:
    If the channel for this input will be set up as a standard channel, provide both locations. The upstream system must push the video streams to these locations.
    If the channel for this input will be set up as a single-pipeline channel, provide only the first location. The upstream system must push its one stream to this location.
