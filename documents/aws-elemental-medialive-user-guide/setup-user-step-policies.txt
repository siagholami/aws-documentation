Step 1: Create Customer Managed Policies
The procedures in this section show how to create two IAM customer managed policies. A customer managed policy is one that you create and manage. (IAM also includes AWS managed policies, which you can't change.) 
Anyone with IAM administrator-level credentials can perform the procedures. 
The first procedure shows how to create a policy called MediaLivePowerAccess that gives full read/write access to AWS Elemental MediaLive.
The second procedure shows how to create a policy called MediaConnectPowerAccess that gives full read/write access to AWS Elemental MediaConnect.
The third procedure shows how to create a policy called MediaLiveTrustedEntityAccess that gives access to six operations in AWS IAM. These actions allow IAM users to create and update a trusted entity role for AWS Elemental MediaLive by setting the fields in the IAM role section on the Channel and input details page on the MediaLive console.
