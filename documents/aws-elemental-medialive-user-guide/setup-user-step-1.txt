Step 1: Identify Requirements for Permissions for Users
You must identify the IAM permissions that you need to grant to users, for AWS Elemental MediaLive features and for ancillary services that MediaLive always interacts with. 
To do that, you should understand the MediaLive workflows for your organization and the different AWS services that the workflows use.
You might not want all regular users to have the same permissions. For example, you might be able to group regular users into three sets: users who can start channels and watch channel activity, users who have some write capabilities, and advanced users who can do everything. As you identify these permissions, think about how many different sets of users you need.
