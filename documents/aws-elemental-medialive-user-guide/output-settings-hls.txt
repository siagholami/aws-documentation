Settings for an HLS Output
In the Output page for an HLS output group, you provide information about the transport for this output and the video, audio, and captions encodes to create in the output.
Output Settings Section

For Name modifier and Segment modifier, complete the fields as described in HLS Group Destinations.
Set the HLS Settings field as appropriate:
If this output is a regular output with video and audio encodes, choose Standard HLS. More fields appear. Keep the default for Audio rendition sets (the value is ignored), and complete the fields under M3U8 as needed or keep the default value, which often is a good choice. For details about a field, choose the Info link next to the field.
If this output is an output that contains only a video encode and the output is part of an output group that includes an audio rendition group, choose Standard HLS. More fields appear. Complete Audio rendition sets as required. Complete the fields under M3U8 as needed or keep the default value, which often is a good choice. For details about a field, choose the Info link next to the field.
If this output is an output that contains only an audio encode and the output is part of an output group that includes an audio rendition group or is part of an output group that has only audio encodes (no video at all), choose Audio only HLS. A special set of fields appears for configuring the audio. For details about a field, choose the Info link next to the field.

Streams Section
In Stream settings, decide if you need to create more encodes for this output, based on the workflow that you planned. By default, each output is set up with one video encode and one audio encode. Choose the appropriate Add button or Delete button to set up the output with the encodes—video, audio, and captions—that you planned for this output.
For example, in one output you might want one video asset and two audio assets, in another output you might want one captions asset for French captions, and in a third output you might want one captions asset for Spanish captions. For information on why you would set up like this (for example, with an output that contains only one captions asset), see Examples of Channel Designs.
For information about the fields in each type of encode, see Step 7: Set Up the Video Encode, Step 8: Set Up the Audio Encodes, and Step 9: Set up the Captions Encodes.
