Editing and Deleting a Channel
You can edit an existing (saved) channel to change how it processes the input, and you can delete a channel. However, you can edit or delete a channel only when it is not running.
Editing a Channel
You can edit any existing channel by editing, adding, or deleting output groups and outputs. You can also edit, add, or delete the channel's video, audio, and caption encodes.
The channel must be idle (not running).
Note
You can't edit a channel to change the input associated with that channel. Instead, you must clone  the channel and associate a different input.
