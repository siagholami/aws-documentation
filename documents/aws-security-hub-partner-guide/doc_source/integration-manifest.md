# Product integration manifest<a name="integration-manifest"></a>

Every AWS Security Hub integration partner must complete a product integration manifest that provides the required details for the proposed integration\.

The Security Hub team uses this information in several ways:
+ To create your website listing
+ To create the product card for the Security Hub console
+ To inform the product team of your use case\.

To evaluate the quality of the proposed integration and the provided information, the Security Hub team uses the [Product readiness checklist](product-readiness-checklist.md)\. This checklist determines whether your integration is ready to be launched\.

All of the technical information that you provide must also be reflected in your documentation\.

You can download a PDF version of the product integration manifest from the **Resources** section of the [AWS Security Hub partners](http://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/partners/) page\.
