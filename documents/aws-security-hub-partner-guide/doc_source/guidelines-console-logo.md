If your logo does not match these dimensions, Security Hub reduces the size to a maximum height of 40 px and a maximum width of 175 px\. This affects how the logo is displayed on the Security Hub console\.  
The following image compares the display of a logo that used the ideal size to logos that were wider or taller\.
