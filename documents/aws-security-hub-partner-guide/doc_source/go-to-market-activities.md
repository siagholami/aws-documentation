Partners can also engage in optional marketing activities to help explain and promote their AWS Security Hub integration\.

If you want to create your own marketing content related to Security Hub, before you release the content, send a draft to your APN Partner manager for review and approval\. This ensures that everyone is aligned on messaging\. 

AWS Partner Network \(APN\) Partners can use APN Partner Marketing Central and the Market Development Funds \(MDF\) program to create campaigns and get funding support\. For details about these programs, contact your partner manager\.

## Entry on the Security Hub partners page<a name="partners-page-entry"></a>

After you are approved as a Security Hub partner, your solution can be displayed on the [AWS Security Hub partners page](http://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/partners/)\.

To be listed on this page, provide the following details to your APN Partner contacts\. This could be your partner development manager \(PDM\), partner solution architect \(PSA\), or an email to securityhub\-pms@amazon\.com\.
+ A brief description of your solution, its integration with Security Hub, and the value that the integration with Security Hub provides to customers\. This description is limited to 700 characters including spaces\.
+ The URL to a page that describes your solution\. This site should be specific to your AWS integration and more specifically your Security Hub integration\. It should focus on the customer experience and the value that customers receive when they use the integration\.
+ A high\-resolution copy of your logo that is 600 x 300 pixels\. For details on the requirements for this logo, see [Logo for partners page](manifest-use-case-marketing.md#manifest-partners-page-logo)\.

## Press release<a name="press-release"></a>

As an approved partner, you can optionally publish a press release on your website and public relations channels\. The press release must be approved by AWS\.

Before you publish the press release, you must submit it to AWS for review by APN Partner marketing, Security Hub leadership, and AWS External Security Services \(ESS\)\. The press release can include a proposed quote for the VP of ESS\.

To initiate this process, work with your PDM\. We have a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) of 10 business days to review press releases\.

## AWS Partner Network \(APN\) blog<a name="partner-network-blog"></a>

We can also help you post a blog entry that you author to the APN blog\. The blog entry must focus on a customer story and use case\. It cannot be positioned solely around being an integration launch partner\.

If you are interested, contact your PDM or PSA to begin the process\. APN blogs can take 8 weeks or longer for final approval and publishing\.
