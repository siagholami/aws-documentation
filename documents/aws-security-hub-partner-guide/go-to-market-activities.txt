Go-to-market activities
Partners can also engage in optional marketing activities to help explain and promote their AWS Security Hub integration.
If you want to create your own marketing content related to Security Hub, before you release the content, send a draft to your APN Partner manager for review and approval. This ensures that everyone is aligned on messaging. 
AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners can use APN Partner Marketing Central and the Market Development Funds (MDF) program to create campaigns and get funding support. For details about these programs, contact your partner manager.
Entry on the Security Hub partners page
After you are approved as a Security Hub partner, your solution can be displayed on the AWS Security Hub partners page.
To be listed on this page, provide the following details to your APN Partner contacts. This could be your partner development manager (PDM), partner solution architect (PSA), or an email to securityhub-pms@amazon.com.
 A brief description of your solution, its integration with Security Hub, and the value that the integration with Security Hub provides to customers. This description is limited to 700 characters including spaces.
 The URL to a page that describes your solution. This site should be specific to your AWS integration and more specifically your Security Hub integration. It should focus on the customer experience and the value that customers receive when they use the integration.
 A high-resolution copy of your logo that is 600 x 300 pixels. For details on the requirements for this logo, see Logo for partners page.
Press release
As an approved partner, you can optionally publish a press release on your website and public relations channels. The press release must be approved by AWS.
Before you publish the press release, you must submit it to AWS for review by APN Partner marketing, Security Hub leadership, and AWS External Security Services (ESS). The press release can include a proposed quote for the VP of ESS.
To initiate this process, work with your PDM. We have a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 10 business days to review press releases.
AWS Partner Network (APN) blog
We can also help you post a blog entry that you author to the APN blog. The blog entry must focus on a customer story and use case. It cannot be positioned solely around being an integration launch partner.
If you are interested, contact your PDM or PSA to begin the process. APN blogs can take 8 weeks or longer for final approval and publishing.
Key things to know about the APN blog
When you create a blog post, keep the following items in mind.
What goes into a blog post?
Partner posts should be educational and provide deep expertise on a topic relevant to AWS customers. 
The ideal length is no more than 1,500 words. Readers value deep, educational content that teaches them what is possible on AWS.
The content should be original to the APN blog. Do not repurpose content from sources such as existing blog posts or whitepapers.
What are other limits on posting to the APN blog?
Only Advanced or Premier tier partners can post to the APN blog. There are exceptions for Select partners that have an APN Program Designation such as Service Delivery.
Each partner is limited to three posts per year. With tens of thousands of APN Partners, AWS must be equitable in its coverage.
Each post must have a technical sponsor who can validate the solution or use case.
How long does it take to edit a blog post before it is posted?
After you submit the first full-length draft of the blog post, it takes from four to six weeks to edit.
Why write for the APN blog?
An APN blog post can provide the following benefits.
 Credibility – For APN Partners, having a story published by AWS can influence customers globally.
 Visibility – The APN blog is one of the most-read blogs at AWS with 1.79 million page views in 2019, including influenced traffic.
 Business – APN Partner posts have connect buttons that can generate leads through the APN Customer Engagements (ACE) program.
What type of content is the best fit?
The following types of content are best suited for an APN blog post.
 Technical content is the most popular type of story. This includes solution spotlights and how-to information. Over 75% of readers look at this technical content.
 Customers value 200-level or above stories that demonstrate how something works on AWS or how an APN Partner solved a business problem for customers.
 Posts written by technical experts or subject matter experts perform the best by far.

A slick sheet is a one-page document that outlines your product, its integration architecture, and joint customer use cases.
If you create a slick sheet for your integration, send a copy to the Security Hub team. They will add it to the partner page.
Whitepaper or ebook
If you create a whitepaper or ebook outlining your product, its integration architecture, and joint customer use cases, send a copy to the Security Hub team. They will add it to the Security Hub partner page. 
Webinar
If you do conduct a webinar about your integration, send a recording of the webinar to the Security Hub team. The team will link to it from the partner page.
The team can also provide a Security Hub subject matter expert to participate in your webinar.
Demo video
For marketing purposes, you can produce a demo video of the working integration. Post such a video on your video platform account, and the Security Hub team will link to it from the partner page.
