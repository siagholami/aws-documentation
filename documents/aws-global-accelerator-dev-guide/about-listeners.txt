Adding, editing, or removing a listener
This section explains how to work with listeners on the AWS Global Accelerator console. To complete these tasks by using an API operation instead of the console, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_CreateListener.html, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_UpdateListener.html, and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_DeleteListener.html in the AWS Global Accelerator API Reference.
To add a listener


Open the Global Accelerator console at  https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#Global Accelerator:. 


On the accelerators page, choose an accelerator.


Choose Add listener.


On the Add listener page, enter the ports or port ranges that you want to associate with the listener. Listeners support ports 1-65535.


Choose the protocol for the ports that you entered.


Optionally, choose to enable client affinity. Client affinity for a listener means that Global Accelerator ensures that connections from a specific source (client) IP address are always routed to the same endpoint. To enable this behavior, in the dropdown list, choose Source IP.


The default is None, which means that client affinity is not enabled and Global Accelerator distributes traffic equally between the endpoints in the endpoint groups for the listener.
For more information, see Client affinity.

Choose Add listener.
