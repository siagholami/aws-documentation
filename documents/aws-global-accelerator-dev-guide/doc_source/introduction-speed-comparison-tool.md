# AWS Global Accelerator Speed Comparison Tool<a name="introduction-speed-comparison-tool"></a>

You can use the AWS Global Accelerator Speed Comparison Tool to see Global Accelerator download speeds compared to direct internet downloads, across AWS Regions\. This tool enables you to use your browser to see the performance difference when you transfer data using Global Accelerator\. You choose a file size to download, and the tool downloads files over HTTPS/TCP from Application Load Balancers in different Regions to your browser\. For each Region, you see a direct comparison of the download speeds\.

To access the Speed Comparison Tool, copy the following URL into your browser:

**Important**  
Results may differ when you run the test multiple times\. Download times can vary based on factors that are external to Global Accelerator, such as the quality, capacity, and distance of the connection in the last\-mile network that you're using\.
