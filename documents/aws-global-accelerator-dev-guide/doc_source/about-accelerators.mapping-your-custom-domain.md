# Route custom domain traffic to your accelerator<a name="about-accelerators.mapping-your-custom-domain"></a>

In most scenarios, you can configure DNS to use your custom domain name \(such as `www.example.com`\) with your accelerator, instead of using the assigned static IP addresses or the default DNS name\. First, using Amazon Route 53 or another DNS provider, create a domain name, and then add or update DNS records with your Global Accelerator IP addresses\. Or you can associate your custom domain name with the DNS name for your accelerator\. Complete the DNS configuration and wait for the changes to propagate over the internet\. Now when a client makes a request using your custom domain name, the DNS server resolves it to the IP addresses, in random order, or to the DNS name for your accelerator\.

To use your custom domain name with Global Accelerator when you use Route 53 as your DNS service, you create an alias record that points your custom domain name to the DNS name assigned to your accelerator\. An alias record is a Route 53 extension to DNS\. It's similar to a CNAME record, but you can create an alias record both for the root domain, such as `example.com`, and for subdomains, such as `www.example.com`\. For more information, see [ Choosing Between Alias and Non\-Alias Records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html) in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide\. 

To set up Route 53 with an alias record for an accelerator, follow the guidance included in the following topic: [ Alias Target](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values-alias.html#rrsets-values-alias-alias-target) in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide\.
