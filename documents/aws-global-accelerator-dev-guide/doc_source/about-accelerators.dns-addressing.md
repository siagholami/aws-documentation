# Support for DNS addressing in Global Accelerator<a name="about-accelerators.dns-addressing"></a>

When you create an accelerator, Global Accelerator provisions two static IP addresses for you\. It also assigns a default Domain Name System \(DNS\) name to your accelerator, similar to `a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com`, that points to the static IP addresses\. The static IP addresses are advertised globally using anycast from the AWS edge network to your endpoints such as Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses\. You can use your accelerator's static IP addresses or DNS name to route traffic to your accelerator\. DNS servers and DNS resolvers use a round robin to resolve the DNS name for an accelerator, so the name resolves to the static IP addresses for the accelerator, returned by Amazon Route 53 in random order\. Clients typically use the first IP address that is returned\.

**Note**  
Global Accelerator creates two Pointer \(PTR\) records that map an accelerator’s static IP addresses to the corresponding DNS name generated by Global Accelerator, to support reverse DNS lookup\. This is also known as a reverse hosted zone\. Be aware that the DNS name that Global Accelerator generates for you isn't configurable, and you can't create PTR records that point to your custom domain name\. Global Accelerator also does not create PTR records for static IP addresses from an IP address range that you bring to AWS \(BYOIP\)\.
