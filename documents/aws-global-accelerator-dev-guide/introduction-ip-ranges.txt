Location and IP address ranges of Global Accelerator edge servers
For a list of Global Accelerator edge server locations, see the Where is AWS Global Accelerator deployed today? section on the  AWS Global Accelerator FAQs page.
AWS publishes its current IP address ranges in JSON format. To view the current ranges, download  ip-ranges.json. For more information, see AWS IP Address Ranges in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
To find the IP address ranges that are associated with AWS Global Accelerator edge servers, search ip-ranges.json for the following string:
"service": "GLOBALACCELERATOR"
Global Accelerator entries that include "region": "GLOBAL" refer to the static IP addresses that are allocated to customer accelerators. If you want to filter for traffic through your accelerator that comes from points of presence (POPs) in one area, filter for entries that include a specific geographical area, such as us-* or eu-*. So, for example, if you filter for us-*, you will see only traffic coming through POPs in the United States (U.S.).
