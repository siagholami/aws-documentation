AWS IoT Analytics can embed the HTML output of your container dataset (found in the file output.html) on the container dataset content page of the AWS IoT Analytics console. For example, if you define a container dataset that runs a Jupyter notebook, and you create a visualization in your Jupyter notebook, your dataset might look like the following.

Then, after the container dataset content is created, you can view this visualization on the console's Data Set content page.

Visualizing AWS IoT Analytics data with Amazon QuickSight
AWS IoT Analytics provides direct integration with Amazon QuickSight. Amazon QuickSight is a fast business analytics service you can use to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from your data. Amazon QuickSight enables organizations to scale to hundreds of thousands of users, and delivers responsive performance by using a robust in-memory engine (SPICE). You can select your AWS IoT Analytics datasets in the Amazon QuickSight console and start creating dashboards and visualizations. Amazon QuickSight is available in these Regions.
To get started with your Amazon QuickSight visualizations, you must create a Amazon QuickSight account. Make sure you give Amazon QuickSight access to your AWS IoT Analytics data when you set up you account. If you already have an account, give Amazon QuickSight access your AWS IoT Analytics data by choosing Admin, Manage QuickSight, Security & permissions. Under QuickSight access to AWS services, choose Add or remove, then select the check box next to AWS IoT Analytics and choose Update.

After your account is set up, from the admin Amazon QuickSight console page choose New Analysis and New data set, and then choose AWS IoT Analytics as the source. Enter a name for your data source, choose a dataset to import, and then choose Create data source.

After your data source is created, you can create visualizations in Amazon QuickSight.

For information about Amazon QuickSight dashboards and datasets, see the Amazon QuickSight documentation.
