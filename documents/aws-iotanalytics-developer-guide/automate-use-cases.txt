Use cases
Automate product quality measurement to lower OpEx
You have a system with a smart valve that measures pressure, humidity and temperature. The system collates events periodically and also when certain events occur, such as when a value opens and closes. With AWS IoT Analytics, you can automate an analysis that aggregates non-overlapping data from these periodic windows and creates KPI reports on end-product quality. After processing each batch, you measure the overall product quality and lower your operational expenditure through maximized run volume.
Automate the analysis of a fleet of devices
You run analytics (algorithm, data science or ML for KPI) every 15 minutes on data generated by 100s of devices. With each analytics cycle generating and storing state for next analytics run. For each of your analyses, you want to use only that data received within a specified time window. With AWS IoT Analytics you can orchestrate your analyses and create the KPI and report for each run then store the data for future analytics. 
Automate anomaly detection
AWS IoT Analytics enables you to automate your anomaly detection workflow that you manually have to run every 15 minutes on new data which has arrived in a data store. You can also automate a dashboard that shows device usage and top users within a specified period of time.
Predict industrial process outcomes
You have industrial production lines. Using the data sent to AWS IoT Analytics, including available process measurements, you can operationalize the analytical workflows to predict process outcomes. Data for the model can be arranged in an M x N matrix where each row contains data from various time points where laboratory samples are taken. AWS IoT Analytics helps you operationalize your analytical workflow by creating delta windows and using your data science tools to create KPIs and save the state of the measurement devices.
