RunPipelineActivity
Here is an example of how you would use the RunPipelineActivity command to test a pipeline activity. For this example we test a math activity.

Create a maths.json file, which contains the definition of the pipeline activity you want to test.

{
       "math": {
           "name": "MyMathActivity",
           "math": "((temp - 32) * 5.0) / 9.0",
           "attribute": "tempC"
       }
   }

Create a file payloads.json file, which contains the example payloads that are used to test the pipeline activity.

[
       "{\"humidity\": 52, \"temp\": 68 }",
       "{\"humidity\": 52, \"temp\": 32 }"
   ]

Call the RunPipelineActivities operation from the command line.

aws iotanalytics run-pipeline-activity  --pipeline-activity file://maths.json  --payloads file://payloads.json
This produces the following results.
{
       "logResult": "",
       "payloads": [
           "eyJodW1pZGl0eSI6NTIsInRlbXAiOjY4LCJ0ZW1wQyI6MjB9",
           "eyJodW1pZGl0eSI6NTIsInRlbXAiOjMyLCJ0ZW1wQyI6MH0="
       ]
   }
The payloads listed in the results are Base64-encoded strings. When these strings are decoded, you get the following results.
{"humidity":52,"temp":68,"tempC":20}
   {"humidity":52,"temp":32,"tempC":0}
