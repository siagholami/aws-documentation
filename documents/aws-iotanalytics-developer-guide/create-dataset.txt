Creating a dataset
You retrieve data from a data store by creating a SQL dataset or a container dataset. AWS IoT Analytics can query the data to answer analytical questions. Although a data store is not a database, you use SQL expressions to query the data and produce results that are stored in a data set.

Querying data
To query the data, you create a data set. A data set contains the SQL that you use to query the data store along with an optional schedule that repeats the query at a day and time you choose. You create the optional schedules using expressions similar to Amazon CloudWatch schedule expressions. 
Run the following command to create a data set.
aws iotanalytics create-dataset --cli-input-json file://mydataset.json
Where the mydataset.json file contains the following content.
{
    "datasetName": "mydataset",
    "actions": [
        {
            "actionName":"myaction",
            "queryAction": {
                "sqlQuery": "select * from mydatastore"
            }
        }
    ]
}
Run the following command to create the data set content by executing the query.
aws iotanalytics create-dataset-content --dataset-name mydataset
Wait a few minutes for the data set content to be created before you continue.
Accessing the queried data
The result of the query is your data set content, stored as a file, in CSV format. The file is made available to you through Amazon S3. The following example shows how you can check that your results are ready and download the file.
Run the following get-dataset-content command.
aws iotanalytics get-dataset-content --dataset-name mydataset
If your data set contains any data, then the output from get-dataset-content, has "state": "SUCCEEDED" in the status field, like this the following example.
```
{
    "timestamp": 1508189965.746,
    "entries": [
        {
          "entryName": "someEntry",
          "dataURI": "https://aws-iot-analytics-datasets-f7253800-859a-472c-aa33-e23998b31261.s3.amazonaws.com/results/f881f855-c873-49ce-abd9-b50e9611b71f.csv?X-Amz-"
    }
],
"status": {
  "state": "SUCCEEDED",
  "reason": "A useful comment."
}

}
```
dataURI is a signed URL to the output results. It is valid for a short period of time (a few hours). Depending on your workflow, you might want to always call get-dataset-content before you access the content because calling this command generates a new signed URL.
