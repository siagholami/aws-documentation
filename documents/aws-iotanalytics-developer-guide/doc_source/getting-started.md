# Getting started with AWS IoT Analytics<a name="getting-started"></a>

This section discusses the basic commands you use to collect, store, process, and query your device data using AWS IoT Analytics\. The examples shown here use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. For more information on the AWS CLI, see the [AWS Command Line Interface User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)\. For more information about the CLI commands available for AWS IoT, see [iot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iot/index.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface Reference*\. 

**Important**  
Use the `aws iotanalytics` command to interact with AWS IoT Analytics using the AWS CLI\. Use the `aws iot` command to interact with other parts of the IoT system using the AWS CLI\.

**Note**  
Be aware as you enter the names of AWS IoT Analytics entities \(channel, data set, data store, and pipeline\) in the examples that follow, that any uppercase letters you use are automatically changed to lowercase by the system\. The names of entities must start with a lower\-case letter and contain only lowercase letters, underscores and digits\.
