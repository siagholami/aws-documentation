# Containerizing a notebook<a name="automate-containerize"></a>

This section includes information about how to build a Docker container using a Jupyter notebook\. There is a security risk if you re\-use notebooks built by third parties: included containers can execute arbitrary code with your user permissions\. In addition, the HTML generated by the notebook can be displayed in the AWS IoT Analytics console, providing a potential attack vector on the computer displaying the HTML\. Make sure you trust the author of any third\-party notebook before using it\.

One option to perform advanced analytical functions is to use a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)\. Jupyter Notebook provides powerful data science tools that can perform machine learning and a range of statistical analyses\. For more information, see [Notebook templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/quickstart.html#aws-iot-analytics-notebook-templates)\. \(Note that we do not currently support containerization inside JupyterLab\.\) You can package your Jupyter Notebook and libraries into a container that periodically runs on a new batch of data as it is received by AWS IoT Analytics during a delta time window you define\. You can schedule an analysis job that uses the container and the new, segmented data captured within the specified time window, then stores the job's output for future scheduled analytics\. 

If you have created a SageMaker Instance using the AWS IoT Analytics console after August 23, 2018, then the installation of the containerization extension has been done for you automatically [and you can begin creating a containerized image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/automate.html#aws-iot-analytics-automate-containerized-image)\. Otherwise, follow the steps listed in this section to enable notebook containerization on your SageMaker instance\. In what follows, you modify your SageMaker Execution Role to allow you to upload the container image to Amazon EC2 and you install the containerization extension\.

## Enable containerization of notebook instances not created via AWS IoT Analytics console<a name="automate-containerize-notebook"></a>

We recommend that you create a new SageMaker instance via the AWS IoT Analytics console instead of following these steps\. New instances automatically support containerization\.

If you restart your SageMaker instance after enabling containerization as shown here, you won't have to re\-add the IAM roles and policies, but you must re\-install the extension, as shown in the final step\.

1. To grant your notebook instance access to Amazon ECS, select your SageMaker instance on the SageMaker page:   
![\[Containerize a notebook in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize01.png)

1. Under **IAM role ARN**, choose the SageMaker Execution Role\.  
![\[Containerize a notebook in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize02.png)

1. Choose **Attach Policy**, then define and attach the policy shown in [Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/automate.html#aws-iot-analytics-automate-permissions)\. If the `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` policy is not already attached, attach it as well\.  
![\[Containerize a notebook in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize03.png)

You also must download the containerization code from Amazon S3 and install it on your notebook instance, The first step is to access the SageMaker instance's terminal\.

1. Inside Jupyter, choose **New**\.  
![\[Containerize a notebook in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize04.png)

1. In the menu that appears, choose **Terminal**\.  
![\[Containerize a notebook in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize05.png)

1. Inside the terminal, enter the following commands to download the code, unzip it, and install it\. Note that these commands kill any processes being run by your notebooks on this SageMaker instance\.  
![\[Containerize a notebook in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize06.png)

   ```
   cd /tmp
   
   aws s3 cp s3://iotanalytics-notebook-containers/iota_notebook_containers.zip /tmp
   
   unzip iota_notebook_containers.zip
   
   cd iota_notebook_containers
   
   chmod u+x install.sh
   
   ./install.sh
   ```

   Wait for a minute or two for the extension to be validated and installed\. 

## Update your notebook containerization extension<a name="automate-update-notebook"></a>

If you created your SageMaker Instance via the AWS IoT Analytics console after August 23, 2018, then the containerization extension was installed automatically\. You can update the extension by restarting your instance from SageMaker Console\. If you installed the extension manually, then you may update it by re\-running the terminal commands listed in Enable Containerization Of Notebook Instances Not Created Via AWS IoT Analytics Console\. 

## Create a containerized image<a name="automate-update-notebook-image"></a>

In this section we show the steps necessary to containerize a notebook\. To begin, go to your Jupyter Notebook to create a notebook with a containerized kernel\.

1. In your Jupyter Notebook, choose **New**, then choose the kernel type you want from the dropdown list\. \(The kernel type should start with "Containerized" and end with whatever kernel you would have otherwise selected\. For example, if you just want a plain Python 3\.0 environment like "conda\_python3", choose "Containerized conda\_python3"\)\.

1. After you have completed work on your notebook and you want to containerize it, choose **Containerize**\.  
![\[Update your notebook containerization extension in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize08.png)

1. Enter a name for the containerized notebook\. You can also enter an optional description\.  
![\[Update your notebook containerization extension in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize09.png)

1. Specify the **Input Variables** \(parameters\) that your notebook should be invoked with\. You can select the input variables that are automatically detected from your notebook or define custom variables\. \(Note that input variables are only detected if you have previously executed your notebook\.\) For each input variable choose a type\. You can also enter an optional description of the input variable\.  
![\[Update your notebook containerization extension in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize10.png)

1. Choose the Amazon ECR repository where the image created from the notebook should be uploaded\.  
![\[Update your notebook containerization extension in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize11.png)

1. Choose **Containerize** to begin the process\. 

   You are presented with an overview summarizing your input\. Note that after you have started the process you can't cancel it\. The process might last up to an hour\.  
![\[Update your notebook containerization extension in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize12.png)

1. The next page shows the progress\.  
![\[Update your notebook containerization extension in AWS IoT Analytics.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/images/containerize13.png)

1. If you accidentally close your browser, you can monitor the status of the containerization process from the **Notebooks** section of the AWS IoT Analytics console\.

1. After the process is complete, the containerized image is stored on Amazon ECR ready for use\.
