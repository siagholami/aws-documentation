"""
Purpose

Gathers titles and purpose statements from README.md files and generates a top-level
README.md file at the specified root that lists all of the examples and their
purposes. Any existing README.md file at the root is overwritten.

Currently this script requires a very specific README format and works only for the
Python section, but it could be expanded to encompass other parts of the repo.
