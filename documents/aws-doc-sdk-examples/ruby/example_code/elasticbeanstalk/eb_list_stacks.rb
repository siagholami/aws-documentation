USAGE = <<DOC

Usage: ruby eb_list_stacks [FILTER] [-r REGION] [-h]

Lists some or all ElasticBeanstalk solution stacks

If FILTER is supplied, only shows stacks containing FILTER, case-insensitive,
so "java" matches "Java", "JAVA", etc.

If REGION is not supplied, defaults to 'us-east-1'

-h     Shows this message and quits
