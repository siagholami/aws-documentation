# Demonstrates how to:
# 1. Create a rule in Amazon CloudWatch Events.
# 2. Add a target to the rule.
# 3. Send an event to Amazon CloudWatch Events so that it can be matched to the rule.
# 4. View the results in Amazon CloudWatch Metrics and Logs.

# To test this code, you must have:
# 1. An AWS Lambda function that uses the hello-world blueprint to serve as the target for events. To learn how,
#    see "Step 1: Create a Lambda Function" of the "Tutorial: Log the State of an EC2 Instance Using CloudWatch Events"
#    topic in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide.
#    Make a note of the AWS Lambda function Amazon Resource Name (ARN), as you will need it later in the code.
# 2. An AWS IAM service role containing a policy granting permission to Amazon CloudWatch Events.
#    For the role policy, use:
=begin
