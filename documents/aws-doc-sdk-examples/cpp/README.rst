AWS SDK for C++ Code Examples
#############################

A collection of code examples for the AWS SDK for C++. The examples are grouped
according to the AWS service they demonstrate.

Prerequisites
=============

To build the examples, the following software must be installed and configured.

* AWS SDK for C++
* AWS credentials: Either configured in a local AWS credentials file or by 
  setting the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables
* Microsoft Visual Studio (Windows) or a C++11 compiler (Linux/macOS)
* CMake version 3.2 or later

Create a build environment
==========================

Create a build root directory. The directory can be located either within 
the example directory structure or outside of it.

::

    mkdir sdk_example_builds
    cd sdk_example_builds

Create a build directory to store the compiled examples for a particular 
AWS service. Each service should have its own build directory.

::

    mkdir s3
    cd s3

Build the examples on Windows
=============================

Run CMake and MSBuild. The compiled and linked executable files are
located in the Debug directory.

::

    cd \<BUILD_ROOT_DIRECTORY>\<SERVICE>
    cmake -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Program Files (x86)/aws-cpp-sdk-all/" /awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/cpp/example_code/<SERVICE>
    msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj

Define the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable to specify the directory 
where the AWS SDK for C++ was installed. Also specify the Code Catalog
directory where the service's examples are located.

On the MSBuild command line, specify the ALL_BUILD.vcxproj argument. 
Alternatively, in Microsoft Visual Studio, open the ALL_BUILD.vcxproj 
project and select Build > Build Solution.

Note: MSBuild is included with Microsoft Visual Studio. Its location 
depends on the Visual Studio version.

* 2019 Community Edition: "\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\"
* 2017 Community Edition: "\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Community\\MSBuild\\15.0\\Bin\\amd64\\"

Build the examples on Linux/macOS
=================================

Run CMake and make. The compiled and linked executable files are
located in the build directory.

::

    cd /<BUILD_ROOT_DIRECTORY>/<SERVICE>
    sudo cmake /awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/cpp/example_code/<SERVICE>
    sudo make

On the CMake command line, specify the Code Catalog directory where
the service's examples are located.

If CMake does not locate the required C++11 compiler, specify its location
by defining CMake variables, as demonstrated below.

::

    sudo cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gcc -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++ /awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/cpp/example_code/<SERVICE>
