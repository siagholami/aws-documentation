# AWS IAM getting started examples

## Purpose

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to manage AWS Identity and Access 
Management (IAM) resources. Learn to accomplish the following tasks:

* Create and manage IAM user access keys.
* Manage the alias of an account.
* Acquire reports about account usage.
* Create and manage IAM policies, including versioned policies.
* Create and manage IAM roles, including how to attach and detach policies.
* Create and manage IAM users, including how to attach a policy to a user.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and
  Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).
- Python 3.6 or later
- Boto3 1.11.10 or later
- PyTest 5.3.5 or later (to run unit tests)

## Cautions

- As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the 
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see 
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) 
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management 
  User Guide*.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are 
  available only in specific Regions. For more information, see the 
  [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  on the AWS website.
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code

Each file can be run separately at a command prompt. For example, see the user
demonstration by running the following at a command prompt.

```
python user_wrapper.py
```  

### Example structure

The examples are divided into the following files:

**access_key_wrapper.py**

Shows how to create and manage IAM user access keys, including how to determine
the time a key was last used and which service it was used for.

**account_wrapper.py**

Shows how to manage the alias of an account and how to acquire various reports about
account usage.

**policy_wrapper.py**

Shows how to create and manage IAM policies, including how to create policy versions,
set a default policy version, and roll back to a previous policy version.

**role_wrapper.py**

Shows how to create and manage IAM roles, including how to attach and detach policies.

**user_wrapper.py**

Shows how to create and manage IAM users, including how to attach a policy to a user.
Also includes a complete demonstration that creates users with different permissions.
It also shows how they can only perform the actions allowed by their attached policies. 

## Running the tests

The unit tests in this module use the botocore Stubber, which captures requests before 
they are sent to AWS, and returns a mocked response. To run all of the tests, 
run the following in your [GitHub root]/python/example_code/iam/iam_basics 
folder.

```    
python -m pytest
```
