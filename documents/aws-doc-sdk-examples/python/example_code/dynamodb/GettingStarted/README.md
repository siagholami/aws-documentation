# Amazon DynamoDB getting started examples

## Purpose

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to create an Amazon DynamoDB 
table for storing movies, load movies into the table from a JSON-formatted file, 
and update and query movies in various ways.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and
  Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).
- Python 3.6 or later
- Boto 3 1.11.10 or later
- PyTest 5.3.5 or later (to run unit tests)
- Download and extract the 
  [example movie data JSON file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/samples/moviedata.zip). 

## Cautions

- As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the 
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see 
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) 
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management 
  User Guide*.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are 
  available only in specific Regions. For more information, see the 
  [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  on the AWS website.
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code

The files in this example are designed to be used as part of the 
[Getting Started Developing with Python and DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.Python.html) step-by-step
tutorial in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

The functions in this example are configured to connect to a locally installed
version of DynamoDB as described in [Setting Up DynamoDB Local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html).
To run the code against your AWS account instead, remove the 
`endpoint_url="http://localhost:8000"` parameter from the resource creation 
function in each file so that the code looks like the following. 

```
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
``` 

Each file can be run separately at a command prompt. For example, create the
Movies table by running the following from a command prompt window.

```
python MoviesCreateTable.py
```  

## Running the tests

The unit tests in this module use the botocore Stubber, which captures requests before 
they are sent to AWS and returns a mocked response. To run all of the tests, 
run the following in your [GitHub root]/python/example_code/dynamodb/GettingStarted 
folder.

```    
python -m pytest
```
