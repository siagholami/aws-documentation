# Amazon S3 batch and versioning examples

## Purpose

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to set up an Amazon S3 bucket for 
versioning, and how to perform taks on a version-enabled bucket. Learn to 
accomplish the following tasks:

* Create a version-enabled bucket and apply revisions to its objects.
* Get a full series of object versions.
* Roll back to a previous version.
* Revive a deleted object.
* Permanently delete all versions of an object.

Shows how to manipulate Amazon S3 versioned objects in batches by creating jobs
that call AWS Lambda functions to perform processing. Learn to accomplish the
following tasks:

* Create Lambda functions that operate on versioned objects.
* Create a manifest of objects to update.
* Create batch jobs that invoke Lambda functions to update objects.
* Delete Lambda functions.
* Empty and delete a versioned bucket.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and
  Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).
- Python 3.8.0 or later
- Boto 3 1.13.2 or later
- PyTest 5.3.5 or later (to run unit tests)

## Cautions

- As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the 
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see 
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) 
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management 
  User Guide*.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are 
  available only in specific Regions. For more information, see the 
  [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  on the AWS website.
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code

This module contains two usage demonstrations: single object and batch object. 

#### Single-object demo

The `usage_demo_single_object` function in `versioning.py` demonstrates basic requests 
to manipulate a versioned object. The script performs the following actions.

1. Creates a version-enabled bucket and uploads a stanza from the poem *You Are Old,
Father William* by Lewis Carroll.
1. Applies a series of revisions to the stanza object.
1. Gets and prints the latest version of the stanza.
1. Gets the full series of versions of the stanza.
1. Rolls back two revisions and prints the result.
1. Deletes the stanza.
1. Revives the stanza.
1. Permanently deletes all versions of the stanza.
1. Deletes the bucket.

Run the following command to see the single-object demo.

```
python -m versioning
``` 

#### Batch operation demo

The `batch_versioning.py` file contains setup, usage, and teardown functions that 
demonstrate how to use Lambda functions to perform batch operations on versioned
objects. The scripts perform the following actions.

`setup_demo`
1. Creates an AWS Access and Identity Management (IAM) role and attached policy that 
has the permissions needed by the Lambda functions used in this demo.
1. Creates Lambda functions that perform revisions on objects and remove delete markers
from versioned objects.
1. Creates a version-enabled bucket and uploads the stanzas from the poem *You Are Old,
Father William* by Lewis Carroll.

`usage_demo_batch_operations`
1. Creates a batch job that performs a series of random revisions on each stanza 
object, using the `revise_stanza` Lambda function.
1. Creates a batch job that revives any stanzas that were deleted during the revision
step, using the `remove_delete_marker` Lambda function.
1. Creates many delete markers and other revisions in the bucket.
1. Creates a batch job that removes all delete markers from the bucket, using the
`remove_delete_marker` Lambda function.

`teardown_demo`
1. Deletes the IAM role and policies created during setup.
1. Deletes Lambda functions created during setup.
1. Empties and deletes the bucket created during setup.

`revise_stanza.py`

This file contains code that is uploaded as a Lambda handler to perform revisions on
objects during the demonstration.

`remove_delete_marker.py`

This file contains code that is uploaded as a Lambda handler to remove delete markers
from versioned objects during the demonstration. 

Run the following command to see the batch operation demo.

```
python -m batch_versioning
``` 

*Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.*

## Running the tests

All tests use the botocore Stubber, which captures requests before they are sent to 
AWS and returns a mocked response. Run the following in your 
[GitHub root]/python/example_code/s3/s3_versioning folder.

```
python -m pytest -o log_cli=1 --log-cli-level=INFO
```

The `-o log_cli=1 --log-cli-level=INFO flags configure pytest to output
logs to stdout during the test run. Without them, pytest captures logs and prints
them only when the test fails.
