"""
Purpose
    Demonstrate basic object operations in Amazon S3.
    Learn how to put, get, delete, and configure objects.
    Usage is shown in the test/test_object_wrapper.py file.

Running the tests
    The best way to learn how to use this service is to run the tests.
    For instructions on testing, see the README.

Running the code
    Run the usage_demo function in a command window or individual functions in
    the Python shell to make calls to your AWS account.
    For instructions on running the code, see the README.

Additional information
    Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
