# Typescript environment for Amazon Glacier examples
Environment for AWS SDK for JavaScript (V3) AWS Glacier samples. For more information, see the 
[AWS documentation for these examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/glacier-examples.html).

Amazon S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive are a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 cloud storage classes for data archiving and long-term backup. 

This is a workspace where you can find working AWS SDK for JavaScript (V3) Glacier samples. 

**NOTE:** The AWS SDK for JavaScript (V3) is written in TypeScript so, for consistency, these examples are also in TypeScript. TypeScript is
a super-set of JavaScript so these examples can also be run as JavaScript.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the [AWSDocs Code Samples repo](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples) to your local environment. 
   See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for 
   instructions.

2. Install the dependencies listed in the package.json.

**Note**: These include the client module for the AWS services required in these example, 
which is the *@aws-sdk/client-glacier*.
```
npm install ts-node -g // if you prefer to use JavaScript, enter 'npm install node -g' instead
cd javascript/example_code_v3/glacier
npm install
```
3. If you prefer to use JavaScript:
- change the sample file extension from ```.ts``` to ```.js```
- remove the ```module.exports ={*}``` statement from the sample file

4. In your text editor, update user variables specified in the 'Inputs' section of the sample file.

5. Run sample code:
```
cd src
ts-node [sample name].ts // e.g., ts-node createVault.ts
```
