ABOUT THIS NODE.JS EXAMPLE: This example works with Version 3 (V3) of the AWS SDK for JavaScript,
which is scheduled for release later in 2020. The prerelease version of the SDK is available
at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3. The 'SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide' for V3 is also
scheduled for release later in 2020, and the topic containing this example will be hosted at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/cloudwatch-examples-using-alarm-actions.html.

Purpose:
cw_disablealarmactions.ts demonstrates how to disable actions for an Amazon CloudWatch alarm.

Inputs (replace in code):
- REGION
- ALARM_NAME

Running the code:
ts-node cw_disablealarmactions.ts
*/
// snippet-start:[cw.JavaScript.alarms.disableAlarmActionsV3]

// Import required AWS SDK clients and commands for Node.js
const {
  CloudWatchClient,
  DisableAlarmActionsCommand
} = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch");

// Set the AWS Region
const REGION = "REGION"; //e.g. "us-east-1"

// Set the parameters
const params = { AlarmNames: "ALARM_NAME" }; // e.g., "Web_Server_CPU_Utilization"

// Create CloudWatch service object
const cw = new CloudWatchClient(REGION);

const run = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await cw.send(new DisableAlarmActionsCommand(params));
    console.log("Success, alarm disabled:", data.$metadata.requestId);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error", err);
  }
};
run();
// snippet-end:[cw.JavaScript.alarms.disableAlarmActionsV3]
//for unit tests only
export = { run };
