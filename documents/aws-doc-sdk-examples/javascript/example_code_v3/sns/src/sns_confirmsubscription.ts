ABOUT THIS NODE.JS EXAMPLE: This example works with Version 3 (V3) of the AWS SDK for JavaScript,
which is scheduled for release later in 2020. The prerelease version of the SDK is available
at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3. The 'SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide' for V3 is also
scheduled for release later in 2020, and the topic containing this example will be hosted at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/sns-examples-sending-sms.html.

Purpose:
sns_confirmsubscription.ts demonstrates how to verify an endpoint owner's intent to receive messages by validating the token sent to the endpoint by an earlier Subscribe action.
If the token is valid, the action creates a new subscription and returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This call requires an AWS signature only when the AuthenticateOnUnsubscribe flag is set to "true".
For more information on subscription confirmations, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_ConfirmSubscription.html.

Inputs (replace in code):
- TOKEN: token sent to an endpoint during subscribe action. For example, for an email endpoint, the token is in the URL of the Confirm Subscription page sent by email. For example, 'abc123' is the token in the URL
https://sns.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/confirmation.html?TopicArn=arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:xxxxx:my-aws-topic&Token=abc123&Endpoint=address@email.com/
- TOPIC_ARN
- AuthenticateOnUnsubscribe: either 'true' or 'false'

Running the code:
ts-node sns_confirmsubsrciption.ts

    const data = await sns.send(new ConfirmSubscriptionCommand(params));
    console.log("Success", data.SubscriptionArn);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err, err.stack);
  }
};
