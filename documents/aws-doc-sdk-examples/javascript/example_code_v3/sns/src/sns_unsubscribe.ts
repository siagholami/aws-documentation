which is scheduled for release later in 2020. The prerelease version of the SDK is available
at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3. The 'SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide' for V3 is also
scheduled for release later in 2020, and the topic containing this example will be hosted at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/sns-examples-subscribing-unubscribing-topics.html.

Purpose:
sns_unsubscribe.ts demonstrates how to delete a subscription to an Amazon SNS topic.

- REGION
- TOPIC_SUBSCRIPTION_ARN

Running the code:
ts-node sns_subscribeapp.ts
 */
// snippet-start:[sns.JavaScript.subscriptions.unsubscribeV3]
// Import required AWS SDK clients and commands for Node.js
const { SNSClient, UnsubscribeCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sns");

// Set the AWS Region
const REGION = "REGION"; //e.g. "us-east-1"

// Set the parameters
const params = { SubscriptionArn: "TOPIC_SUBSCRIPTION_ARN" }; //TOPIC_SUBSCRIPTION_ARN

// Create SNS service object
const sns = new SNSClient(REGION);

const run = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await sns.send(new UnsubscribeCommand(params));
    console.log("Subscription is unsubscribed");
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err, err.stack);
  }
};
run();
// snippet-end:[sns.JavaScript.subscriptions.unsubscribeV3]
export = { run }; //for unit tests only
