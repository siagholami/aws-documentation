ABOUT THIS NODE.JS EXAMPLE: This example works with Version 3 (V3) of the AWS SDK for JavaScript,
which is scheduled for release later in 2020. The prerelease version of the SDK is available
at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3. The 'SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide' for V3 is also
scheduled for release later in 2020, and the topic containing this example will be hosted at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/cross-service-example-dataupload.html.
Purpose:
s3_putbucketpolicy.ts is an example that demonstrates how to attach a permissions policy to an Amazon S3 bucket.
Inputs (replace in code):
- REGION
- IDENTITY_POOL_ID
- TABLE_NAME
Running the code:
node s3_putbucketpolicy.ts
