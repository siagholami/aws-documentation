ABOUT THIS NODE.JS EXAMPLE: This example works with Version 3 (V3) of the AWS SDK for JavaScript,
which is scheduled for release later in 2020. The prerelease version of the SDK is available
at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3. The 'SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide' for V3 is also
scheduled for release later in 2020, and the topic containing this example will be hosted at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/s3-example-creating-buckets.html.
Purpose:
s3_list1000plusObjects.ts demonstrates how to list more than 1000 objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.
Inputs (replace in code):
- REGION
- BUCKET_NAME
Running the code:
s3_getbucketwebsite s3_list1000plusObjects.ts

// snippet-start:[s3.JavaScript.buckets.listManyObjectsV3]
// Import required AWS SDK clients and commands for Node.js
const { S3Client, ListObjectsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3");

// Set the AWS Region
const REGION = "REGION"; //e.g. "us-east-1"

// Create the parameters for the bucket
const bucketParams = { Bucket: "BUCKET_NAME" };

// Create S3 service object
const s3 = new S3Client(REGION);
