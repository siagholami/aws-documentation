AWS SDK for JavaScript examples
###############################

These are examples for the AWS SDK for JavaScript public documentation.

Prerequisites
=============

To build and run these examples, you'll need:

- Node.js
- AWS SDK for JavaScript downloaded and extracted somewhere on your machine
- AWS credentials in a shared credentials file

Running the examples
====================

Examples are written for either execution in a browser script or in Node.js, usually depending on the use case for each. The two scenarios typically differ in how you supply credentials to the code. These differences are described in the Developer Guide at `https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials.html <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials.html>`_

To run the examples, you'll need to create a shared credentials file. For more information about how to set up a shared credentials file,
see `Loading Credentials in Node.js from the Shared Credentials File <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html>`_
in the *AWS SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide*.

The Node.js examples are all run from the command line.

SDK Downloads
=============

You can download minified and non-minified distributable versions of the current AWS SDK for JavaScript at:

`https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/tree/master/dist <https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/tree/master/dist>`_

Documentation
=============

You can find detailed documentation for the AWS SDK for JavaScript at:

- `AWS SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide>`_
- `AWS SDK for JavaScript API Reference <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/index.html>`_
