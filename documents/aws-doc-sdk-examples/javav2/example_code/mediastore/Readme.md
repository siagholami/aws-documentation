# AWS Elemental MediaStore Java code examples

This README discusses how to run and test the Java code examples for AWS Elemental MediaStore.

## Running the AWS Elemental MediaStore Java files

**IMPORTANT**

The Java code examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

To run these examples, you'll need the AWS SDK for Java libraries in your **CLASSPATH**.

	export CLASSPATH=target/sdk-examples-1.0.jar:/path/to/aws-java-sdk/<jar-file-name>.jar

Here **/path/to/aws-java-sdk/<jar-file-name>.jar** is the path to where you extracted or built the AWS SDK for Java JAR file.

For systems with Bash support, once you set the **CLASSPATH**, you can run a particular example as follows.

	java com.example.mediastore.ListContainers

 ## Testing the AWS Elemental MediaStore files

You can test the Java code examples for AWS Elemental MediaStore by running a test file named **MediaStoreServiceIntegrationTest**. This file uses JUnit 5 to run the JUnit tests and is located in the **src/test/java** folder. For more information, see [https://junit.org/junit5/](https://junit.org/junit5/).

You can run the JUnit tests from a Java IDE, such as IntelliJ, or from the command line by using Maven. As each test is run, you can view messages that inform you if the various tests succeed or fail. For example, the following message informs you that Test 3 passed.

	Test 3 passed

**WARNING**: _Running these JUnit tests manipulates real Amazon resources and might incur charges on your account._

 ### Properties file
Before running the AWS Elemental MediaStore JUnit tests, you must define values in the **config.properties** file located in the **resources** folder. This file contains values that are required to run the JUnit tests. For example, you define a container name used for various tests. If you do not define all values, the JUnit tests fail.

Define these values to successfully run the JUnit tests:

- **containerName** - The name of a new container.  
- **existingContainer** – The name of an existing container.
- **filePath** – The file location of an MP4 file to upload to a container.
- **putPath** – The container and location where a file is uploaded (for example, Videos5/sampleVideo.mp4).
- **getPath** –  The container and location where a file is downloaded from (for example, Videos5/sampleVideo.mp4).
- **savePath** – The path on the local drive where the file is saved.

### Command line
To run the JUnit tests from the command line, you can use the following command.

		mvn test

You will see output from the JUnit tests, as shown here.

### Unsuccessful tests

If you do not define the correct values in the properties file, your JUnit tests are not successful. You will see an error message such as the following. You need to double-check the values that you set in the properties file and run the tests again.
