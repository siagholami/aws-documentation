#  Amazon Polly Java code examples

This README discusses how to run and test the Java code examples for Amazon Polly.

## Running the Amazon Polly Java files

**IMPORTANT**

The Java examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.

To run these examples, you'll need the AWS SDK for Java libraries in your **CLASSPATH**.

	export CLASSPATH=target/sdk-examples-1.0.jar:/path/to/aws-java-sdk/<jar-file-name>.jar

Here  **/path/to/aws-java-sdk/<jar-file-name>.jar** is the path to where you extracted or built the AWS SDK for Java JAR file.

For systems with Bash support, once you set the **CLASSPATH**, you can run a particular example as follows.

	java com.example.polly.PollyDemo


 ## Testing the Amazon Polly Java files

You can test the Java code examples for Amazon Polly by running a test file named **AWSPollyServiceIntegrationTest**. This file uses JUnit 5 to run the JUnit tests and is located in the **src/test/java** folder. For more information, see [https://junit.org/junit5/](https://junit.org/junit5/).

You can execute the tests from a Java IDE, such as IntelliJ, or from the command line by using Maven. As each test is executed, you can view messages that inform you if the various tests succeed or fail. For example, the following message informs you that Test 3 passed.

	Test 3 passed

### Command line
To execute the JUnit tests from the command line, you can use the following command.

		mvn test

You will see output from the JUnit tests, as shown here.
