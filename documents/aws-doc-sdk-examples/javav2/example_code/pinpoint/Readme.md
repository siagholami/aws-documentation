# Amazon Pinpoint Java code examples

This README discusses how to run and test the Java (v2) code examples for Amazon Pinpoint.

## Running the Amazon Pinpoint Java files

**IMPORTANT**

The Java examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.   

Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting an Amazon Pinpoint application. **Be very careful** when running an operation that deletes or modifies AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only resources when experimenting with these examples.

To run these examples, you'll need the AWS SDK for Java libraries in your **CLASSPATH**.

	export CLASSPATH=target/sdk-pinpoint-examples-1.0.jar:/path/to/aws-java-sdk/<jar-file-name>.jar

Here **/path/to/aws-java-sdk/<jar-file-name>.jar** is the path to where you extracted or built the AWS SDK for Java JAR file.

For systems with Bash support, once you set the **CLASSPATH**, you can run a particular example as follows.

	java com.example.pinpoint.CreateApp


 ## Testing the Amazon Pinpoint Java files

You can test the Java code examples for Amazon Pinpoint by running a test file named **AmazonPinpointServiceIntegrationTest**. This file uses JUnit 5 to run the JUnit tests and is located in the **src/test/java** folder. For more information, see [https://junit.org/junit5/](https://junit.org/junit5/).

You can run the JUnit tests from a Java IDE, such as IntelliJ, or from the command line by using Maven. As each test is run, you can view messages that inform you if the various tests succeed or fail. For example, the following message informs you that Test 3 passed.

	Test 3 passed

**WARNING**: _Running these JUnit tests manipulate real AWS resources and may incur charges on your account._

 ### Properties file
Before running the JUnit tests, you must define values in the **config.properties** file located in the **src/main/resources** folder. This file contains values that are required to run the JUnit tests. For example, you define an application name required for various tests. If you do not define all values, the JUnit tests fail.

Define these values to successfully run the JUnit tests:

- **appName** - The name of the Amazon Pinpoint application. For example, **TestApp2**.

- **bucket** – The name of an Amazon S3 bucket to use for the **ImportSegments** test.

- **path** – The path where the JSON file is located in the bucket for the **ImportSegments** test. For example, **imports/myjson.json**.

- **roleArn** - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role for the **ImportSegments** test.


###  Sample policy text

For the purpose of the JUnit tests, the **ImportSegments** test uses a JSON file to import segments. You must place this JSON file in the S3 bucket specified in the **bucket** value. Also, this JSON file must be located in the **path** location. The following represents an example myjson.json file that you can use for the **ImportSegments** test.   

	{
   	"ChannelType":"SMS",
   	"Address":"2065550182",
   	"Location":{
      		"Country":"CAN"
   	},
   	"Demographic":{
      	"Platform":"Android",
      	"Make":"LG"
   	},
   	"User":{
      	 "UserId":"example-user-id-1"
   	}
	}{
   	 "ChannelType":"APNS",
   	 "Address":"1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1a2b3c4d5e6f",
   	 "Location":{
      	"Country":"USA"
   	 },
   	 "Demographic":{
      	"Platform":"iOS",
      	"Make":"Apple"
   	 },
   	 "User":{
        "UserId":"example-user-id-2"
   	}
	}{
   	 "ChannelType":"EMAIL",
   	 "Address":"john.stiles@example.com",
   	 "Location":{
      	 "Country":"USA"
   	  },
   	 "Demographic":{
      	 "Platform":"iOS",
      	 "Make":"Apple"
   	 },
   	 "User":{
      	"UserId":"example-user-id-2"
   	 }
	 }

### Command line
To run the JUnit tests from the command line, you can use the following command.

	mvn test

You will see output from the JUnit tests, as shown here.

### Unsuccessful tests

If you do not define the correct values in the properties file, your JUnit tests are not successful. You will see an error message such as the following. You need to double-check the values that you set in the properties file and run the tests again. Also, ensure that you placed the JSON file in the correct S3 bucket location.
