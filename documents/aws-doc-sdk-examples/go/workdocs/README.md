# AWS SDK for Go code examples for Amazon WorkDocs

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several Amazon WorkDocs operations.

## Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
configured as described in
[Configuring the AWS SDK for Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html)
in the _AWS SDK for Go Developer Guide_.

## Running the code

### ShowUsers/ShowUsers.go

This example displays information about the users in an Amazon WorkDocs organization.

`go run ShowUsers.go -o ORG-ID`

- _ORG-ID_ is the ID of an organization.

The unit test mocks the service client and the `DescribeUsers` function.

### ShowUsersDocs/ShowUsersDocs.go

This example displays information about a user's documents in an Amazon WorkDocs organization.

`go run ShowUsersDocs.go -o ORG-ID -u USER-NAME`

- _ORG-ID_ is the ID of an organization.
- _USER-NAME_ is the name of a user.

The unit test mocks the service client and the `DescribeUsers` and `DescribeFolderContents` functions.

### Notes

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege,
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the unit tests

Unit tests should delete any resources they create.
However, they might result in charges to your
AWS account.

To run a unit test, enter the following.

`go test`

You should see something like the following,
where PATH is the path to the folder containing the Go files.

```sh
PASS
ok      PATH 6.593s
```

To see any log messages, enter the following.

`go test -test.v`

You should see additional log messages.
The last two lines should be similar to the previous output shown.
