Step 3: Getting Started (Console)
The easiest way to get started with Amazon Translate is to use the console to translate some text. You can translate up to 5,000 characters using the console. If you haven't reviewed the concepts and terminology in How Amazon Translate Works, we recommend that you do so before proceeding.
To start translating text, go to the  AWS Management Console  and open the Amazon Translate console. 
If this is the first time that you've used Amazon Translate, choose Launch real-time translation.
In Real-time translation, choose the source and target languages. Enter the text that you want to translate in the left-hand text box. The translated text appears in the right-hand text box.

In the JSON samples section you can see the JSON input and output to the TranslateText operation.
