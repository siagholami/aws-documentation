Throttling
Amazon Translate scales to serve customer operational traffic. If you encounter sustained throttling, contact AWS Support.
Guidelines
To continuously improve the quality of its analysis models, Amazon Translate might store your data. To learn more, see the Amazon Translate FAQ. 
You can request that we delete your data and that future data associated with your account isn't stored by contacting AWS Support. However, because deleting your data can also delete unique training data that is helpful in improving translation, doing so might reduce the quality of your translations.
