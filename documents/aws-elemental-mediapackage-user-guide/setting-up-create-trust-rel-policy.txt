Step 1: Create a Policy
The IAM policy defines the permissions that AWS Elemental MediaPackage requires to access other services. 
 For video on demand (VOD) workflows, create a policy that allows MediaPackage to read from the Amazon S3 bucket, verify the billing method, and retrieve content. For the billing method, MediaPackage must verify that the bucket does not require the requester to pay for requests. If the bucket has requestPayment enabled, MediaPackage can't ingest content from that bucket.
 For live-to-VOD workflows, create a policy that allows MediaPackage to read from the Amazon S3 bucket and store the live-to-VOD asset in it.
 For content delivery network (CDN) authorization headers, create a policy that allows MediaPackage to read from a secret in Secrets Manager.
The following sections describe how to create these policies.
