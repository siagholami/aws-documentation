Content Encryption in AWS Elemental MediaPackage
Protect your content from unauthorized use through encryption. Digital rights management (DRM) systems provide keys to AWS Elemental MediaPackage for content encryption, and licenses to supported players for decryption.
MediaPackage supports live and VOD content encryption. Live-to-VOD assets, though, must be harvested from unencrypted live content. The live-to-VOD asset is also not encrypted. For more information about this kind of asset, see Creating Live-to-VOD Assets with AWS Elemental MediaPackage.
Note
To encrypt content, you must have a DRM solution provider.
