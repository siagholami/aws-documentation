Adding an Endpoint to a Channel
Add an endpoint to a channel to allow downstream video players and content distribution networks (CDNs) to start requesting content playback.
You can use the AWS Elemental MediaPackage console, the AWS CLI, or the MediaPackage API to add an endpoint to a channel. For information about adding through the AWS CLI or MediaPackage API, see the AWS Elemental MediaPackage API Reference.
For instructions on adding endpoints to a channel from the AWS Elemental MediaPackage console, see Working with Endpoints in AWS Elemental MediaPackage.
