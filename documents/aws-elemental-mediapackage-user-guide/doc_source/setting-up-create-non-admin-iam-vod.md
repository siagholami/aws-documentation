# Step 2: \(Optional\) Create a Policy for AWS Elemental MediaPackage VOD<a name="setting-up-create-non-admin-iam-vod"></a>

If you or your users will be using video on demand \(VOD\) functionality in MediaPackage, create a policy that allows access to resources for the `mediapackage-vod` service\.

The following sections describe how to create a policy that allows all actions, and one that allows read\-only rights\. You can customize the policies by adding or removing actions to fit your workflows\.

## Policy for Full VOD Access<a name="non-admin-iam-vod-all"></a>

This policy allows the user to perform all actions on all VOD resources\.

**To use the JSON policy editor to create a policy**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

   If this is your first time choosing **Policies**, the **Welcome to Managed Policies** page appears\. Choose **Get Started**\.

1. At the top of the page, choose **Create policy**\.

1. Choose the **JSON** tab\.

1. Enter the following JSON policy document:

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "mediapackage-vod:*",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Review policy**\.
**Note**  
You can switch between the **Visual editor** and **JSON** tabs any time\.
