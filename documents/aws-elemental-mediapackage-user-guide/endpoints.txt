Working with Endpoints in AWS Elemental MediaPackage
An endpoint defines a single delivery point of a channel. The endpoint holds all the information that is needed for AWS Elemental MediaPackage to integrate with a player or content distribution network (CDN) such as Amazon CloudFront. Configure the endpoint to output content in one of the available stream formats:
 Apple HLS – packages content to Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)
 Microsoft Smooth – packages content for Microsoft Smooth Streaming players
 CMAF – packages content to devices that support Apple HLS fragmented MP4 (fMP4)
 DASH-ISO – packages content for the DASH-ISO ABR streaming protocol
Additionally, the endpoint holds information about digital rights management (DRM) and encryption integration, stream bitrate presentation order, and more.
