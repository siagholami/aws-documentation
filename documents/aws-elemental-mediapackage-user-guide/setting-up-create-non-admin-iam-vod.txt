Step 2: (Optional) Create a Policy for AWS Elemental MediaPackage VOD
If you or your users will be using video on demand (VOD) functionality in MediaPackage, create a policy that allows access to resources for the mediapackage-vod service.
The following sections describe how to create a policy that allows all actions, and one that allows read-only rights. You can customize the policies by adding or removing actions to fit your workflows.
Policy for Full VOD Access
This policy allows the user to perform all actions on all VOD resources.
To use the JSON policy editor to create a policy


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation column on the left, choose Policies. 


If this is your first time choosing Policies, the Welcome to Managed Policies page appears. Choose Get Started.


At the top of the page, choose Create policy.


Choose the JSON tab.


Enter the following JSON policy document:


{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "mediapackage-vod:*",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }


Choose Review policy.
Note
You can switch between the Visual editor and JSON tabs any time. However, if you make changes or choose Review policy in the Visual editor tab, IAM might restructure your policy to optimize it for the visual editor. For more information, see Policy Restructuring in the IAM User Guide.


On the Review policy page, enter a Name and an optional Description for the policy that you are creating. Review the policy Summary to see the permissions that are granted by your policy. Then choose Create policy to save your work.
