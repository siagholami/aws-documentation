Tagging AWS Elemental MediaPackage Resources
Tagging is available with only live workflows in AWS Elemental MediaPackage. You can't use tags on video on demand (VOD) or harvested live-to-VOD assets.
A tag is a metadata label that you assign or that AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value. For tags that you assign, you define the key and value. For example, you might define the key as stage and the value for one resource as test.
Tags help you do the following:
 Identify and organize your AWS resources. Many AWS services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you could assign the same tag to an AWS Elemental MediaPackage channel and endpoint that you assign to an AWS Elemental MediaTailor configuration.
 Track your AWS costs. You activate these tags on the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard. AWS uses the tags to categorize your costs and deliver a monthly cost allocation report to you. For more information, see Use Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
For tips on using tags, see the AWS Tagging Strategies post on the AWS Answers blog.
