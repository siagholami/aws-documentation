Deleting a Channel
Delete a channel to stop AWS Elemental MediaPackage from receiving further content. You must delete the channel's endpoints (as described in Deleting an Endpoint) before you can delete the channel.
You can use the AWS Elemental MediaPackage console, the AWS CLI, or the MediaPackage API to delete a channel. For information about deleting a channel through the AWS CLI or MediaPackage API, see the AWS Elemental MediaPackage API Reference.
To delete a channel (console)

If there is an Amazon CloudFront distribution associated with the channel, select the CloudFront link in the confirmation dialog box to go to the CloudFront console to delete the distribution. AWS Elemental MediaPackage will not delete the distribution when the channel is deleted. For help deleting in CloudFront, see Deleting a Distribution in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.
