Step 1: (Optional) Create a Policy for Amazon CloudFront
If you or your users will create Amazon CloudFront distributions from the AWS Elemental MediaPackage live console, create a policy that allows access to CloudFront.
For more information about using CloudFront with AWS Elemental MediaPackage, see Working with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).
To use the JSON policy editor to create a policy


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.


In the navigation column on the left, choose Policies. 


If this is your first time choosing Policies, the Welcome to Managed Policies page appears. Choose Get Started.


At the top of the page, choose Create policy.


Choose the JSON tab.


Enter the following JSON policy document:


{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "cloudfront:GetDistribution",
                   "cloudfront:CreateDistributionWithTags",
                   "cloudfront:UpdateDistribution",
                   "tag:GetResources"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }


Choose Review policy.
Note
You can switch between the Visual editor and JSON tabs any time. However, if you make changes or choose Review policy in the Visual editor tab, IAM might restructure your policy to optimize it for the visual editor. For more information, see Policy Restructuring in the IAM User Guide.


On the Review policy page, enter a Name and an optional Description for the policy that you are creating. Review the policy Summary to see the permissions that are granted by your policy. Then choose Create policy to save your work.
