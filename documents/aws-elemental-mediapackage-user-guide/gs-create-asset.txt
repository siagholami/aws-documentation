Step 4: Create an Asset
An asset resource is how MediaPackage ingests, packages, and serves VOD content. The asset is associated with one or more packaging configurations. Downstream devices send playback requests to specific packaging configurations on the asset.
AWS Elemental MediaPackage does not require that you supply any customer data. There are no fields in assets where there is an expectation that you will provide customer data.
To create an asset and ingest source content


From your Amazon S3 buckets, determine what file you're using as source content. Make note of the following:
    The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the file is stored
    The full path for the file, such as S3://bucket/path/source-file-name
    The IAM role that allows AWS Elemental MediaPackage to read from Amazon S3


On the AWS Elemental MediaPackage console, go to the Assets page, and then choose Ingest asset.


For S3 bucket name, select the bucket where your source content is stored.


For IAM role, choose Use existing role and select the IAM role that allows AWS Elemental MediaPackage to read from Amazon S3.


For Filename, enter the path within the Amazon S3 bucket and name for the source content.


For Packaging group, select the group that you created in Step 2: Create a Packaging Group.


Choose Ingest assets.
