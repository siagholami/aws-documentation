Packager Settings Fields
The Packager settings fields hold general information about the endpoint.


For Type, choose Common Media Application Format (CMAF). 


(Optional) For Segment duration, type the duration (in seconds) of each segment. If the value that you type here is different from the input segment size, AWS Elemental MediaPackage rounds segments to the nearest multiple of the input segment duration.


(Optional) For Segment prefix, type a custom name for the segments in the HLS child manifest. The segment prefix is prepended to the segment name to create a unique identifier for each segment.
Example 


If the segment prefix is movie, a segment from the child manifest is movie_1_2.ts.
