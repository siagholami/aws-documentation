 Latency too high
Latency too high
Latency might be caused by the duration of fragments that are sent to the Kinesis Video Streams service. One way to reduce the latency between the producer and the service is to configure the media pipeline to produce shorter fragment durations.
To reduce the number of frames sent in each fragment, and thus reduce the amount of time for each fragment, reduce the following value in kinesis_video_gstreamer_sample_app.cpp:
g_object_set(G_OBJECT (data.encoder), "bframes", 0, "key-int-max", 45, "bitrate", 512, NULL);
Note
Latencies are higher in the Mozilla Firefox browser due to the internal implementation of video rendering.
Troubleshooting API Issues
This section describes API issues that you might encounter when working with Kinesis Video Streams.

Error: "Unable to determine service/operation name to be authorized"
GetMedia can fail with the following error:
Unable to determine service/operation name to be authorized
This error might occur if the endpoint is not properly specified. When you are getting the endpoint, be sure to include the following parameter in the GetDataEndpoint call, depending on the API to be called:
--api-name GET_MEDIA
--api-name PUT_MEDIA
--api-name GET_MEDIA_FOR_FRAGMENT_LIST
--api-name LIST_FRAGMENTS
Error: "Failed to put a frame in the stream"
PutMedia can fail with the following error:
Failed to put a frame in the stream
This error might occur if connectivity or permissions are not available to the service. Run the following in the AWS CLI, and verify that the stream information can be retrieved:
aws kinesisvideo describe-stream --stream-name StreamName --endpoint https://ServiceEndpoint.kinesisvideo.region.amazonaws.com
If the call fails, see Troubleshooting AWS CLI Errors for more information.
Error: "Service closed connection before final AckEvent was received"
PutMedia can fail with the following error:
com.amazonaws.SdkClientException: Service closed connection before final AckEvent was received
This error might occur if PushbackInputStream is improperly implemented. Ensure that the unread() methods are correctly implemented.
Error: "STATUS_STORE_OUT_OF_MEMORY"
PutMedia can fail with the following error:
The content store is out of memory.
This error occurs when the content store is not allocated with sufficient size. To increase the size of the content store, increase the value of StorageInfo.storageSize. For more information, see StorageInfo.
Troubleshooting HLS Issues
This section describes issues that you might encounter when using HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) with Kinesis Video Streams.
Topics
 Retrieving HLS streaming session URL succeeds, but playback fails in video player
 Latency too high between producer and player
Retrieving HLS streaming session URL succeeds, but playback fails in video player
This situation occurs when you can successfully retrieve an HLS streaming session URL using GetHLSStreamingSessionURL, but the video fails to play back when the URL is provided to a video player.
To troubleshoot this situation, try the following:
 Determine whether the video stream plays back in the Kinesis Video Streams console. Consider any errors that the console shows.
 If the fragment duration is less than one second, increase it to one second. If the fragment duration is too short, the service might throttle the player because it is making requests for video fragments too frequently.
 Verify that each HLS streaming session URL is being used by only one player. If more than one player is using a single HLS streaming session URL, the service might receive too many requests and throttle them.
 Verify that your player supports all of the options that you are specifying for the HLS streaming session. Try different combinations of values for the following parameters: 
   ContainerFormat
   PlaybackMode
   FragmentSelectorType
   DiscontinuityMode
   MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults
Some media players (like HTML5 and mobile players) typically only support HLS with the fMP4 container format. Other media players (like Flash and custom players) may only support HLS with the MPEG TS container format. Experimenting with the ContainerFormat parameter is a good place to start troubleshooting.
 Verify that each fragment has a consistent number of tracks. Verify that fragments in the stream are not changing between having both an audio and video track and just a video track. Also verify that the encoder settings (resolution, frame rate, etc) are not changing between fragments in each track.
Latency too high between producer and player
This situation occurs when the latency is too high from when the video is captured to when it is played in the video player.
Video is played back through HLS on a per-fragment basis. Therefore, latency can't be less than fragment duration. Latency also includes the time needed for buffering and transferring data. If your solution requires latency of less than one second, consider using the GetMedia API instead.
You can adjust the following parameters to reduce the overall latency, but adjusting these parameters might also reduce the video quality or increase the rebuffering rate.
 Fragment duration: The fragment duration is the amount of video between divisions in the stream as controlled by the frequency of keyframes generated by the video encoder. The recommended value is one second. Having a shorter fragment duration means that less time is spent waiting for the fragment to complete before transmitting the video data to the service. Shorter fragments are also faster for the service to process. However, if the fragment duration is too short, the probability increases that the player will run out of content and have to stop and buffer content. If the fragment duration is less than 500 milliseconds, the producer might create too many requests, causing the service to throttle them.
 Bitrate: A video stream with a lower bitrate takes less time to read, write, and transmit. However, a video stream with a lower bitrate usually has a lower video quality.
 Fragment count in media playlists: A latency-sensitive player should only load the newest fragments in a media playlist. Most players start at the oldest fragment instead. By reducing the number of fragments in the playlist, you reduce the time separation between the old and new fragments. With a smaller playlist size, it is possible for a fragment to be skipped during playback, if there is a delay in adding new fragments to the playlist, or if there is a delay in the player getting an updated playlist. We recommend using 3â€“5 fragments, and to use a player that is configured to load only the newest fragments from a playlist. 
 Player buffer size: Most video players have a configurable minimum buffer duration, usually with a 10-second default. For the lowest latency, you can set this value to 0 seconds. However, doing so means that the player rebuffers if there is any delay producing fragments because the player will have no buffer for absorbing the delay.
 Player "catch up": Video players typically don't automatically catch playback up to the front of the video buffer if the buffer fills up, such as when a delayed fragment causes a backlog of fragments to play. A custom player can avoid this by either dropping frames, or increasing the playback speed (for example, to 1.1x) to catch up to the front of the buffer. This causes playback to be choppy or increase in speed as the player catches up, and rebuffering might be more frequent as the buffer size is kept short.
Troubleshooting Java Issues
This section describes how to troubleshoot common Java issues encountered when working with Kinesis Video Streams.
Topics
 Enabling Java logs
Enabling Java logs
To troubleshoot issues with Java samples and libraries, it is helpful to enable and examine the debug logs. To enable debug logs, do the following:

Add log4j to the pom.xml``` file, in thedependencies` node: 

<dependency>
       <groupId>log4j</groupId>
       <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
       <version>1.2.17</version>
   </dependency>

In the target/classes directory, create a file named log4j.properties with the following contents:

```
   # Root logger option
   log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, stdout
# Redirect log messages to console
   log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
   log4j.appender.stdout.Target=System.out
   log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
   log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p %c{1}:%L - %m%n
log4j.logger.org.apache.http.wire=DEBUG
   ```
The debug logs then print to the IDE console.
Troubleshooting Producer Library Issues
This section describes issues that you might encounter when using the Producer Libraries.
Topics

 "Invalid thing name passed" error when using IoT authorization
Cannot compile the Producer SDK
Verify that the required libraries are in your path. To verify this, use the following command:
$ env | grep LD_LIBRARY_PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/local/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/kinesis-video-native-build/downloads/local/lib
Video stream does not appear in the console
To display your video stream in the console, it must be encoded using H.264 in AvCC format. If your stream is not displayed, verify the following:
 Your NAL Adaptation Flags are set to NAL_ADAPTATION_ANNEXB_NALS | NAL_ADAPTATION_ANNEXB_CPD_NALS if the original stream is in Annex-B format. This is the default value in the StreamDefinition constructor.
 You are providing the codec private data correctly. For H.264, this is the sequence parameter set (SPS) and picture parameter set (PPS). Depending on your media source, this data may be retrieved from the media source separately or encoded into the frame.
Many elementary streams are in the following format, where Ab is the Annex-B start code (001 or 0001):
Ab(Sps)Ab(Pps)Ab(I-frame)Ab(P/B-frame) Ab(P/B-frame)â€¦. Ab(Sps)Ab(Pps)Ab(I-frame)Ab(P/B-frame) Ab(P/B-frame)
The CPD (Codec Private Data) which in the case of H.264 is in the stream as SPS and PPS, can be adapted to the AvCC format. Unless the media pipeline gives the CPD separately, the application can extract the CPD from the frame by looking for the first Idr frame (which should contain the SPS/PPS), extract the two NALUs [which will be Ab(Sps)Ab(Pps)] and set it in the CPD in StreamDefinition.
Error: "Security token included in the request is invalid" when streaming data using the GStreamer demo application
If this error occurs, there is an issue with your credentials. Verify the following:
 If you are using temporary credentials, you must specify the session token.
 Verify that your temporary credentials are not expired.
 Verify that you have the proper rights set up.
 On macOS, verify that you do not have credentials cached in Keychain.
Error: "Failed to submit frame to Kinesis Video client"
If this error occurs, the timestamps are not properly set in the source stream. Try the following:
 Use the latest SDK sample, which might have an update that fixes your issue.
 Set the high-quality stream to a higher bit rate, and fix any jitter in the source stream if the camera supports doing so.
GStreamer application stops with "streaming stopped, reason not-negotiated" message on OS X
Streaming may stop on OS X with the following message:
Debugging information: gstbasesrc.c(2939): void gst_base_src_loop(GstPad *) (): /GstPipeline:test-pipeline/GstAutoVideoSrc:source/GstAVFVideoSrc:source-actual-src-avfvide:
streaming stopped, reason not-negotiated (-4)
A possible workaround for this is to remove the framerate parameters from the gst_caps_new_simple call in kinesis_video_gstreamer_sample_app.cpp:
GstCaps *h264_caps = gst_caps_new_simple("video/x-h264",
                                             "profile", G_TYPE_STRING, "baseline",
                                             "stream-format", G_TYPE_STRING, "avc",
                                             "alignment", G_TYPE_STRING, "au",
                                             "width", GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE, 320, 1920,
                                             "height", GST_TYPE_INT_RANGE, 240, 1080,
                                             "framerate", GST_TYPE_FRACTION_RANGE, 0, 1, 30, 1,
                                             NULL);
Error: "Failed to allocate heap" when creating Kinesis Video Client in GStreamer demo on Raspberry Pi
The GStreamer sample application tries to allocate 512 MB of RAM, which might not be available on your system. You can reduce this allocation by reducing the following value in KinesisVideoProducer.cpp:
device_info.storageInfo.storageSize = 512 * 1024 * 1024;
Error: "Illegal Instruction" when running GStreamer demo on Raspberry Pi
If you encounter the following error when executing the GStreamer demo, ensure that you have compiled the application for the correct version of your device. (For example, ensure that you are not compiling for Raspberry Pi 3 when you are running on Raspberry Pi 2.)
INFO - Initializing curl.
Illegal instruction
Camera fails to load on Raspberry Pi
To check whether the camera is loaded, run the following:
$ ls /dev/video*
If nothing is found, run the following:
$ vcgencmd get_camera
The output should look similar to the following:
supported=1 detected=1
If the driver does not detect the camera, do the following:


Check the physical camera setup and verify that it's connected properly.


Run the following to upgrade the firmware:


$ sudo rpi-update


Restart the device.


Run the following to load the driver:


$ sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2

Verify that the camera was detected:

$ ls /dev/video*
Camera can't be found on macOS High Sierra
On macOS High Sierra, the demo application can't find the camera if more than one camera is available.
jni.h file not found when compiling on macOS High Sierra
To resolve this error, update your installation of Xcode to the latest version.
Curl errors when running the GStreamer demo application
To resolve curl errors when you run the GStreamer demo application, copy this certificate file to /etc/ssl/cert.pem.
Timestamp/range assertion at runtime on Raspberry Pi
If a timestamp range assertion occurs at runtime, update the firmware and restart the device:
$ sudo rpi-update 
$ sudo reboot
Assertion on gst_value_set_fraction_range_full on Raspberry Pi
The following assertion appears if the uv4l service is running: 
gst_util_fraction_compare (numerator_start, denominator_start, numerator_end, denominator_end) < 0' failed
If this occurs, stop the uv4l service and restart the application.
STATUS_MKV_INVALID_ANNEXB_NALU_IN_FRAME_DATA (0x3200000d) error on Android
The following error appears if the NAL Adaptation Flags are incorrect for the media stream: 
putKinesisVideoFrame(): Failed to put a frame with status code 0x3200000d
If this error occurs, provide the correct .withNalAdaptationFlags flag for your media (for example, NAL_ADAPTATION_ANNEXB_CPD_NALS). Provide this flag in the following line of the Android Producer Library: 
 https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-android-samples/blob/master/AmazonKinesisVideoDemoApp/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/kinesisvideo/demoapp/fragment/StreamConfigurationFragment.java#L169
Maximum Fragment Duration Was Reached Error
This error occurs when a media fragment in a stream exceeds the maximum fragment duration limit. By default, Kinesis Video Streams sets a streamâ€™s maximum fragment duration to 10 seconds.
To resolve this issue, try the following:
 If you are using a webcam/USB camera, do one of the following:
   If the you are using key frame-based fragmentation, then set the encoder to provide key frames within 10 seconds.
   If you are not using key frame-based fragmentation, then when defining the stream in Step 2: Write and Examine the Code, set the maximum fragment duration limit to a value that's less than 10 seconds.
   If you are using software encoders (like x264) in the GStreamer pipeline, you can set the key-int-max attribute to a value within 10 seconds (for example, set key-int-max to 60, with fps set to 30, to enable key frames every 2 seconds).
 If you are using an RPI camera, set the keyframe-interval attribute to be less than 10 seconds.
 If you are using an IP (RTSP) camera, set the GOP size to 60. 
"Invalid thing name passed" error when using IoT authorization
To avoid this error (HTTP Error 403: Response: {"message":"Invalid thing name passed"}) when you're using IoT credentials for authorization, make sure that the value of stream-name (a required parameter of the kvssink element) is identital to the value of iot-thingname. For more information, see GStreamer Element Parameter Reference.
Troubleshooting Stream Parser Library Issues
This section describes issues that you might encounter when using the Stream Parser Library.
Topics
 Cannot access a single frame from the stream
 Fragment decoding error
Cannot access a single frame from the stream
To access a single frame from a streaming source in your consumer application, ensure that your stream contains the correct codec private data. For information about the format of the data in a stream, see Data Model. 
To learn how to use codec private data to access a frame, see the following test file on the GitHub website: KinesisVideoRendererExampleTest.java
Fragment decoding error
If your fragments are not properly encoded in an H.264 format and level that the browser supports, you might see the following error when playing your stream in the console:
Fragment Decoding Error
There was an error decoding the video data. Verify that the stream contains valid H.264 content
If this occurs, verify the following:
 The resolution of the frames matches the resolution specified in the Codec Private Data.
 The H.264 profile and level of the encoded frames matches the profile and level specified in the Codec Private Data.
 The browser supports the profile/level combination. Most current browsers support all profile and level combinations.
 The timestamps are accurate and in the correct order, and no duplicate timestamps are being created.
 Your application is encoding the frame data using the H.264 format.
