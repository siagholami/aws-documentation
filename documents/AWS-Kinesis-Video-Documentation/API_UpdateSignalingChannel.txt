UpdateSignalingChannel
Updates the existing signaling channel. This is an asynchronous operation and takes time to complete. 
If the MessageTtlSeconds value is updated (either increased or reduced), it only applies to new messages sent via this channel after it's been updated. Existing messages are still expired as per the previous MessageTtlSeconds value.
