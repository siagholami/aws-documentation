Using the C Producer SDK as a GStreamer Plugin in a Docker Container
GStreamer is a popular media framework used by a multitude of cameras and video sources to create custom media pipelines by combining modular plugins. The Kinesis Video Streams GStreamer plugin greatly simplifies the integration of your existing GStreamer media pipeline with Kinesis Video Streams. 
In addition, using Docker to create the GStreamer pipeline standardizes the operating environment for Kinesis Video Streams, which greatly simplifies building and executing the application.
