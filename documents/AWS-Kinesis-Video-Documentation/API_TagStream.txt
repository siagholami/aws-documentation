TagStream
Adds one or more tags to a stream. A tag is a key-value pair (the value is optional) that you can define and assign to AWS resources. If you specify a tag that already exists, the tag value is replaced with the value that you specify in the request. For more information, see Using Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide. 
You must provide either the StreamName or the StreamARN.
This operation requires permission for the KinesisVideo:TagStream action.
Kinesis video streams support up to 50 tags.
