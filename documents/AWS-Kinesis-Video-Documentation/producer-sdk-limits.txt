Producer SDK Limits
The following table contains the current limits for values in the Producer Libraries.
Note
Before setting these values, you must validate your inputs. The SDK doesn't validate these limits, and a runtime error occurs if the limits are exceeded.

Limit
Notes




Max stream count
128
The maximum number of streams that a producer object can create. This is a soft limit (you can request an increase). It ensures that the producer doesn't accidentally create streams recursively.


Max device name length
128 characters
 


Max tag count
50 per stream
 


Max stream name length
256 characters
 


Min storage size
10 MiB = 10 * 1024 * 1024 bytes
 


Max storage size
10 GiB = 10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes
 


Max root directory path length
4,096 characters
 


Max auth info length
10,000 bytes
 


Max URI string length
10,000 characters
 


Max tag name length
128 characters
 


Max tag value length
1,024 characters
 


Min security token period
30 seconds
 


Security token grace period
40 minutes
If the specified duration is longer, it is limited to this value.


Retention period
0 or greater than one hour
0 indicates no retention.


Min cluster duration
1 second
The value is specified in 100 ns units, which is the SDK standard.


Max cluster duration
30 seconds
The value is specified in 100 ns units, which is the SDK standard. The backend API may enforce a shorter cluster duration.


Max fragment size
50 MB
For more information, see Kinesis Video Streams Limits.


Max fragment duration
10 seconds
For more information, see Kinesis Video Streams Limits.


Max connection duration
45 minutes
The backend closes the connection after this time. The SDK rotates the token and establishes a new connection within this time.


Max ACK segment length
1,024 characters
Maximum segment length of the acknowledgement sent to the ACK parser function.


Max content type string length
128 characters
 


Max codec ID string length
32 characters
 


Max track name string length
32 characters
 


Max codec private data length
1 MiB = 1 * 1024 * 1024 bytes
 


Min timecode scale value length
100 ns
The minimum timecode scale value to represent the frame timestamps in the resulting MKV cluster. The value is specified in increments of 100 ns, which is the SDK standard.


Max timecode scale value length
1 second
The maximum timecode scale value to represent the frame timestamps in the resulting MKV cluster. The value is specified in increments of 100 ns, which is the SDK standard.


Min content view item count
10
 


Min buffer duration
20 seconds
The value is specified in increments of 100 ns, which is the SDK standard.


Max update version length
128 characters
 


Max ARN length
1024 characters
 


Max fragment sequence length
128 characters
 


Max retention period
10 years
