StartSelector
Identifies the chunk on the Kinesis video stream where you want the GetMedia API to start returning media data. You have the following options to identify the starting chunk: 
 Choose the latest (or oldest) chunk.
 Identify a specific chunk. You can identify a specific chunk either by providing a fragment number or timestamp (server or producer). 
 Each chunk's metadata includes a continuation token as a Matroska (MKV) tag (AWS_KINESISVIDEO_CONTINUATION_TOKEN). If your previous GetMedia request terminated, you can use this tag value in your next GetMedia request. The API then starts returning chunks starting where the last API ended.
Contents
AfterFragmentNumber 
Specifies the fragment number from where you want the GetMedia API to start returning the fragments. 
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.
Pattern: ^[0-9]$ 
Required: No
ContinuationToken 
Continuation token that Kinesis Video Streams returned in the previous GetMedia response. The GetMedia API then starts with the chunk identified by the continuation token.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.
Pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_\.\-]$ 
Required: No
StartSelectorType 
Identifies the fragment on the Kinesis video stream where you want to start getting the data from.
 NOW - Start with the latest chunk on the stream.
 EARLIEST - Start with earliest available chunk on the stream.
 FRAGMENT_NUMBER - Start with the chunk after a specific fragment. You must also specify the AfterFragmentNumber parameter.
 PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP or SERVER_TIMESTAMP - Start with the chunk containing a fragment with the specified producer or server timestamp. You specify the timestamp by adding StartTimestamp.
  CONTINUATION_TOKEN - Read using the specified continuation token. 
If you choose the NOW, EARLIEST, or CONTINUATION_TOKEN as the startSelectorType, you don't provide any additional information in the startSelector.
Type: String
Valid Values:FRAGMENT_NUMBER | SERVER_TIMESTAMP | PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP | NOW | EARLIEST | CONTINUATION_TOKEN 
Required: Yes
StartTimestamp 
A timestamp value. This value is required if you choose the PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP or the SERVER_TIMESTAMP as the startSelectorType. The GetMedia API then starts with the chunk containing the fragment that has the specified timestamp.
Type: Timestamp
Required: No
