Kinesis Video Stream Parser Library
The Kinesis Video Stream Parser Library is an easy-to-use set of tools you can use in Java applications to consume the MKV data in a Kinesis video stream.
The library includes the following tools:
 StreamingMkvReader: This class reads specified MKV elements from a video stream.
 FragmentMetadataVisitor: This class retrieves metadata for fragments (media elements) and tracks (individual data streams containing media information, such as audio or subtitles).
 OutputSegmentMerger: This class merges consecutive fragments or chunks in a video stream.
 KinesisVideoExample: This is a sample application that shows how to use the Kinesis Video Stream Parser Library.
The library also includes tests that show how the tools are used.

Prerequisites
You must have the following to examine and use the Kinesis Video Stream Parser Library:
 An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. If you don't already have an AWS account, do the following:
   Open https://aws.amazon.com/, and then choose Create an AWS Account.
Note
This might be unavailable in your browser if you previously signed in to the AWS Management Console. In that case, choose Sign In to the Console, and then choose Create a new AWS account.
   Follow the online instructions.
Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad\.

Note your AWS account ID because you need it for configuring programmatic access to Kinesis video streams.
 A Java integrated development environment (IDE), such as Eclipse Java Neon or JetBrains IntelliJ Idea.
