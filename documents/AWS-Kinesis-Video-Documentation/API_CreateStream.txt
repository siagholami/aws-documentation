CreateStream
Creates a new Kinesis video stream. 
When you create a new stream, Kinesis Video Streams assigns it a version number. When you change the stream's metadata, Kinesis Video Streams updates the version. 
CreateStream is an asynchronous operation.
For information about how the service works, see How it Works. 
You must have permissions for the KinesisVideo:CreateStream action.
Request Syntax
```
POST /createStream HTTP/1.1
Content-type: application/json
{
   "DataRetentionInHours": number,
   "DeviceName": "string",
   "KmsKeyId": "string",
   "MediaType": "string",
   "StreamName": "string",
   "Tags": { 
      "string" : "string" 
   }
}
```
URI Request Parameters
The request does not use any URI parameters.
Request Body
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
 DataRetentionInHours  
The number of hours that you want to retain the data in the stream. Kinesis Video Streams retains the data in a data store that is associated with the stream.
The default value is 0, indicating that the stream does not persist data.
When the DataRetentionInHours value is 0, consumers can still consume the fragments that remain in the service host buffer, which has a retention time limit of 5 minutes and a retention memory limit of 200 MB. Fragments are removed from the buffer when either limit is reached.
Type: Integer
Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.
Required: No
 DeviceName  
The name of the device that is writing to the stream. 
In the current implementation, Kinesis Video Streams does not use this name.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.
Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9_.-] 
Required: No
 KmsKeyId  
The ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that you want Kinesis Video Streams to use to encrypt stream data.
If no key ID is specified, the default, Kinesis Video-managed key (aws/kinesisvideo) is used.
 For more information, see DescribeKey. 
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.
Pattern: . 
Required: No
 MediaType  
The media type of the stream. Consumers of the stream can use this information when processing the stream. For more information about media types, see Media Types. If you choose to specify the MediaType, see Naming Requirements for guidelines.
Example valid values include "video/h264" and "video/h264,audio/aac".
This parameter is optional; the default value is null (or empty in JSON).
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.
Pattern: [\w\-\.\]/[\w\-\.\](,[\w\-\.\]/[\w\-\.\])* 
Required: No
 StreamName  
A name for the stream that you are creating.
The stream name is an identifier for the stream, and must be unique for each account and region.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.
Pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9_.-] 
Required: Yes
 Tags  
A list of tags to associate with the specified stream. Each tag is a key-value pair (the value is optional).
Type: String to string map
Key Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.
Key Pattern: ^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=\-@]*)$ 
Value Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 256.
Value Pattern: [\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=\-@]* 
Required: No
Response Syntax
```

Response Elements
If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.
The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.
 StreamARN  
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.
Pattern: arn:aws:kinesisvideo:[a-z0-9-]:[0-9]:[a-z]/[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]/[0-9]
