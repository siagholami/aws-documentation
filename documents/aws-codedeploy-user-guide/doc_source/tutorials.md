# CodeDeploy tutorials<a name="tutorials"></a>

This section includes some tutorials to help you learn how to use CodeDeploy\.

The procedures in these tutorials provide suggestions for the location in which to store files \(for example, c:\\temp\) and the names to give to buckets, subfolders, or files \(for example, codedeploydemobucket, HelloWorldApp, and CodeDeployDemo\-EC2\-Trust\.json, respectively\), but you are not required to use them\. Just be sure to substitute your file locations and names as you perform the procedures\.
