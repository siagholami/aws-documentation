Create a deployment with CodeDeploy
You can use the CodeDeploy console, the AWS CLI, or the CodeDeploy APIs to create a deployment that installs application revisions you have already pushed to Amazon S3 or, if your deployment is to an EC2/On-Premises compute platform, GitHub, on the instances in a deployment group.
The process for creating a deployment depends on the compute platform used by your deployment.
