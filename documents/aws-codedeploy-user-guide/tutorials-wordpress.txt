Tutorial: Deploy WordPress to an Amazon EC2 instance (Amazon Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Linux, macOS, or Unix)
In this tutorial, you deploy WordPress, an open source blogging tool and content management system based on PHP and MySQL, to a single Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

 To practice deploying to an Amazon EC2 instance running Windows Server instead, see Tutorial: Deploy a "hello, world!" application with CodeDeploy (Windows Server).
 To practice deploying to an on-premises instance instead of an Amazon EC2 instance, see Tutorial: Deploy an application to an on-premises instance with CodeDeploy (Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
This tutorial's steps are presented from the perspective of a local development machine running Linux, macOS, or Unix. Although you can complete most of these steps on a local machine running Windows, you must adapt the steps that cover commands such as chmod and wget, applications such as sed, and directory paths such as /tmp.
Before you start this tutorial, you must complete the prerequisites in Getting started with CodeDeploy. These include configuring your IAM user account, installing or upgrading the AWS CLI, and creating an IAM instance profile and a service role.
