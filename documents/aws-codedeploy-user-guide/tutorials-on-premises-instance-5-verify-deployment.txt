Step 5: Verify your deployment
To verify the deployment was successful, follow the instructions in View CodeDeploydeployment details , and then return to this page.
If the deployment was successful, you'll find four text files in the c:\temp\CodeDeployExample folder (for Windows Server) or /tmp/CodeDeployExample (for Ubuntu Server and RHEL). 
If the deployment failed, follow the troubleshooting steps in View instance details with CodeDeploy and Troubleshoot instance issues. Make any required fixes, rebundle and upload your application revision, and then try the deployment again.
