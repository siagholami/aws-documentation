Create a notification rule
You can use notification rules to notify users when there are changes to deployment applications, such as deployment successes and failures. Notification rules specify both the events and the Amazon SNS topic that is used to send notifications. For more information, see What are notifications?
You can use the console or the AWS CLI to create notification rules for AWS CodeDeploy. 
To create a notification rule (console)


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/.


Choose Application, and then choose an application where you want to add notifications.


On the application page, choose Notify, and then choose Create notification rule. You can also go to the Settings page for the application and choose Create notification rule.


In Notification name, enter a name for the rule.


In Detail type, choose Basic if you want only the information provided to Amazon EventBridge included in the notification. Choose Full if you want to include information provided to Amazon EventBridge and information that might be supplied by the CodeDeploy or the notification manager.


For more information, see Understanding notification contents and security.


In Events that trigger notifications, select the events for which you want to send notifications.   
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


In Targets, choose Create SNS topic.
Note
When you create the topic, the policy that allows CodeDeploy to publish events to the topic is applied for you. Using a topic created specifically for CodeDeploy notifications also helps ensure that you only add users to the subscription list for that topic that you want to see notifications about this deployment application.


After the codestar-notifications- prefix,enter a name for the topic, and then choose Submit.
Note
If you want to use an existing Amazon SNS topic instead of creating a new one, in Targets, choose its ARN. Make sure the topic has the appropriate access policy and that the subscriber list contains only those users who are allowed to see information about the deployment application. For more information, see Configure existing Amazon SNS topics for notifications and Understanding notification contents and security. 


To finish creating the rule, choose Submit.


You must subscribe users to the Amazon SNS topic for the rule before they can receive notifications. For more information, see Subscribe users to Amazon SNS topics that are targets. You can also set up integration between notifications and AWS Chatbot to send notifications to Amazon Chime chatrooms or Slack channels. For more information, see Configure integration between notifications and AWS Chatbot.


To create a notification rule (AWS CLI)

At a terminal or command prompt, run the create-notification rule command to generate the JSON skeleton:

aws codestar-notifications create-notification-rule --generate-cli-skeleton > rule.json
You can name the file anything you want. In this example, the file is named rule.json.

Open the JSON file in a plain-text editor and edit it to include the resource, event types, and Amazon SNS target you want for the rule. The following example shows a notification rule named MyNotificationRule for an application named MyDeploymentApplication in an AWS acccount with the ID 123456789012. Notifications are sent with the full detail type to an Amazon SNS topic named codestar-notifications-MyNotificationTopic when deployments are successful:

{
       "Name": "MyNotificationRule",
       "EventTypeIds": [
           "codedeploy-application-deployment-succeeded"
       ],
       "Resource": "arn:aws:codebuild:us-east-2:123456789012:MyDeploymentApplication",
       "Targets": [
           {
               "TargetType": "SNS",
               "TargetAddress": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:codestar-notifications-MyNotificationTopic"
           }
       ],
       "Status": "ENABLED",
       "DetailType": "FULL"
   }
Save the file.

Using the file you just edited, at the terminal or command line, run the create-notification-rule command again to create the notification rule:

aws codestar-notifications create-notification-rule --cli-input-json  file://rule.json

If successful, the command returns the ARN of the notification rule, similar to the following:

{
       "Arn": "arn:aws:codestar-notifications:us-east-1:123456789012:notificationrule/dc82df7a-EXAMPLE"
   }
