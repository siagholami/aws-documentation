Tutorial: Use CodeDeploy to deploy an application from GitHub
In this tutorial, you use CodeDeploy to deploy a sample application revision from GitHub to a single Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux, a single Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instance, or a single Windows Server instance. For information about GitHub integration with CodeDeploy, see Integrating CodeDeploy with GitHub.
Note
You can also use CodeDeploy to deploy an application revision from GitHub to an Ubuntu Server instance. You can use the sample revision described in Step 2: Create a sample application revision in Tutorial: Deploy an application to an on-premises instance with CodeDeploy (Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux), or you can create a revision compatible with an Ubuntu Server instance and CodeDeploy. To create your own revision, see Plan a revision for CodeDeploy and Add an application specification file to a revision for CodeDeploy.
