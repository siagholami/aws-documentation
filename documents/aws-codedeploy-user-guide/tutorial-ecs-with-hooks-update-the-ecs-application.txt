Step 2: Update your Amazon ECS application
In this section, you update your Amazon ECS application to use a new revision of its task definition. You create the new revision and add a minor update to it by adding a tag. 
To update your task definition


Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.


In the navigation pane, choose Task Definitions. 


Select the check box for the task definition used by your Amazon ECS service.


Choose Create new revision. 


Make a small update to the task definition by adding a tag. At the bottom of the page, in Tags, create a new tag by entering a new key and value pair. 


Choose Create. You should see that your task definition's revision number has been incremented by one. 


Choose the JSON tab. Make a note of the value for taskDefinitionArn. Its format is arn:aws:ecs:aws-region: account-id:task-definition/task-definition-family: task-definition-revision. This is the ARN of your updated task definition.
