Edit a trigger in a CodeDeploy deployment group
If your notification requirements change, you can modify your trigger rather than create a new one.
Modify a CodeDeploy trigger (CLI)
To use the AWS CLI to change trigger details for CodeDeploy events when you update a deployment group, create a JSON file to define changes to the deployment group's properties, and then run the update-deployment-group command with the --cli-input-json option. 
The simplest way to create the JSON file is to run the get-deployment-group command to get the current deployment group details in JSON format, and then edit the required values in a plain-text editor.

Run the following command, substituting the names of your application and deployment group for application and deployment-group:

aws deploy get-deployment-group --application-name application --deployment-group-name deployment-group

Copy the results of the command into a plain-text editor and then delete the following:
    At the beginning of the output, delete { "deploymentGroupInfo":. 
    At the end of the output, delete }. 
    Delete the row containing deploymentGroupId.
    Delete the row containing deploymentGroupName.

The contents of your text file should now look similar to the following:
{
       "applicationName": "TestApp-us-east-2",
       "deploymentConfigName": "CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime",
       "autoScalingGroups": [],
       "ec2TagFilters": [
           {
               "Type": "KEY_AND_VALUE",
               "Value": "East-1-Instances",
               "Key": "Name"
           }
       ],
       "triggerConfigurations": [
           {
               "triggerEvents": [
                   "DeploymentStart",
                   "DeploymentSuccess",
                   "DeploymentFailure",
                   "DeploymentStop"
               ],
               "triggerTargetArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:111222333444:Trigger-group-us-east-2",
               "triggerName": "Trigger-group-us-east-2"
           }
       ],
       "serviceRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/AnyCompany-service-role",
       "onPremisesInstanceTagFilters": []
   }


Change any parameters, as necessary. For information about trigger configuration parameters, see TriggerConfig.


Save your updates as a JSON file, and then run the update-deployment-group command using the --cli-input-json option. Be sure to include the --current-deployment-group-name option and substitute the name of your JSON file for filename: 
Important
Be sure to include file:// before the file name. It is required in this command.


aws deploy update-deployment-group --current-deployment-group-name deployment-group-name --cli-input-json file://filename.json
At the end of the creation process, you receive a test notification message that indicates both permissions and trigger details are set up correctly.
