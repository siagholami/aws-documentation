Step 4: Provision an instance
In this step, you will create or configure the instance that you will deploy the sample application to. You can deploy to an Amazon EC2 instance or an on-premises instance that is running one of the operating systems supported by CodeDeploy. For information see Operating systems supported by the CodeDeploy agent. (If you already have an instance configured for use in CodeDeploy deployments, skip to the next step.)
To create or configure an instance, see Working with instances for CodeDeploy, and then return to this page. 
Note
To quickly create a new instance for this tutorial, we recommend using the Amazon EC2 console. See Launch an Amazon EC2 instance (console).
To verify that the CodeDeploy agent is running on the instance, see Verify the CodeDeploy agent is running.
After you have successfully launched or configured the instance and verified the CodeDeploy agent is running, go to the next step.
