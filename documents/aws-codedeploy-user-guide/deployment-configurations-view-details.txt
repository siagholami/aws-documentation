To use the CodeDeploy console to view a list of deployment configuration names:


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy.
Note
Sign in with the same account or IAM user information that you used in Getting started with CodeDeploy.


In the navigation pane, expand Deploy, and choose Deployment configurations.
Here you can see the deployment configuration names and criteria for each deployment configuration. 
Note
If no entries are displayed, make sure the correct region is selected. On the navigation bar, in the region selector, choose one of the regions listed in Region and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference. CodeDeploy is supported in these regions only.


View deployment configuration (CLI)
To use the AWS CLI to view deployment configuration details, call either the get-deployment-config command or the list-deployment-configs command.
To view details about a single deployment configuration, call the get-deployment-config command, specifying the unique deployment configuration name.
To view details about multiple deployment configurations, call the list-deployments command.
