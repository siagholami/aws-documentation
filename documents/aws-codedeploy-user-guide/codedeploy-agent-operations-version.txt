Determine the version of the CodeDeploy agent
You can determine the version of the CodeDeploy agent running on your instance in two ways.
Important
 The minimum supported version of the CodeDeploy agent is 1.0.1.1458. Use of an earlier CodeDeploy agent might cause deployments to fail. 
First, starting with version 1.0.1.854 of the CodeDeploy agent, you can view the version number in a .version file on the instance. The following table shows the location and sample version string for each of the supported operating systems.



Operating system
File location
Sample agent_version string




Amazon Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
/opt/codedeploy-agent/.version

Ubuntu Server

Windows Server
C:\ProgramData\Amazon\CodeDeploy\.version

Second, you can run a command on an instance to determine the version of the CodeDeploy agent.
