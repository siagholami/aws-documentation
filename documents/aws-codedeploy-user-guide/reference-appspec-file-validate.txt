Validate your AppSpec File and file location
File syntax 
You can use the AWS-provided AppSpec Assistant script to validate the contents of an AppSpec file. You can find the script along with AppSpec file templates on GitHub.
You can also use a browser-based tool such as YAML lint or Online YAML parser to help you check your YAML syntax.
File location 
To verify that you have placed your AppSpec file in the root directory of the application's source content's directory structure, run one of the following commands:
On local Linux, macOS, or Unix instances:
ls path/to/root/directory/appspec.yml
If the AppSpec file is not located there, a "No such file or directory" error is displayed.
On local Windows instances:
dir path\to\root\directory\appspec.yml
If the AppSpec file is not located there, a "File Not Found" error is displayed.
