Step 3: Bundle and upload your application revision to Amazon S3
Before you can deploy your application revision, you'll need to bundle the files, and then upload the file bundle to an Amazon S3 bucket. Follow the instructions in Create an application with CodeDeploy and Push a revision for CodeDeploy to Amazon S3 (EC2/On-Premises deployments only). (Although you can give the application and deployment group any name, we recommend you use CodeDeploy-OnPrem-App for the application name and CodeDeploy-OnPrem-DG for the deployment group name.) After you have completed those instructions, return to this page. 
Note
Alternatively, you can upload the file bundle to a GitHub repository and deploy it from there. For more information, see Integrating CodeDeploy with GitHub.
