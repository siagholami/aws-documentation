For more information, see Use the CodeDeploy agent to validate a deployment package on a local machine.
November 16, 2017


Updated topics
CodeDeploy support for Elastic Load Balancing load balancers in deployment groups has been expanded to include Network Load Balancers for both blue/green deployments and in-place deployments. You can now choose an Application Load Balancer, Classic Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer for your deployment group.

A number of topics have been updated to reflect this support, including Integrating CodeDeploy with Elastic Load Balancing, Create an application for an in-place deployment (console), Deployment prerequisites, Integrating CodeDeploy with Elastic Load Balancing, and Create an application for an in-place deployment (console).
September 12, 2017


Updated topics
CodeDeploy support for Elastic Load Balancing load balancers in deployment groups has been expanded to include Application Load Balancers for both blue/green deployments and in-place deployments. You can now choose between an Application Load Balancer and a Classic Load Balancer for your deployment group. Load balancers are required for blue/green deployments, and optional for in-place deployments. Topics including Integrating CodeDeploy with Elastic Load Balancing, Create an application with CodeDeploy, and Create a deployment group with CodeDeploy have been updated to reflect this additional support.
August 10, 2017


New and updated topics
CodeDeploy now supports using multiple tag groups to identify unions and intersections of instances to be included in a deployment group. If you use a single tag group, any instance identified by at least one tag in the group is included in the deployment group. If you use multiple tag groups, only instances that are identified by at least one tag in each of the tag groups are included. For information about the new method for adding instances to a deployment group, see Tagging instances for deployment groups in CodeDeploy. Other topics updated to reflect this support include Create an application for an in-place deployment (console), Create an application for a blue/green deployment (console), Create a deployment group for an in-place deployment (console), Create a deployment group for an EC2/On-Premises blue/green deployment (console), CodeDeploy deployments, and Step 5: Create an application and deployment group in Tutorial: Use CodeDeploy to deploy an application from GitHub.

After the file is downloaded or copied to an instance, you can run the installation manually.
July 12, 2017


Updated topics
CodeDeploy has improved how it manages connections to GitHub accounts and repositories. You can now create and store up to 25 connections to GitHub accounts in order to associate CodeDeploy applications with GitHub repositories. Each connection can support multiple repositories. You can create connections to up to 25 different GitHub accounts, or create more than one connection to a single account. After you connect an application to a GitHub account, CodeDeploy manages the required access permissions without requiring any further action from you. Updates to reflect this support have been made to Specify information about a revision stored in a GitHub repository, Integrating CodeDeploy with GitHub, and Tutorial: Use CodeDeploy to deploy an application from GitHub.
May 30, 2017


Updated topics
In the past, if the CodeDeploy agent detected files in a target location that weren't part of the application revision from the most recent successful deployment, it would fail the current deployment by default. CodeDeploy now provides options for how the agent handles these files: fail the deployment, retain the content, or overwrite the content. Create a deployment with CodeDeploy was updated to reflect this support, and the new section Rollback behavior with existing content was added to Redeploy and roll back a deployment with CodeDeploy.
May 16, 2017


Updated topics
A Classic Load Balancer in Elastic Load Balancing can now be assigned to a deployment group using the CodeDeploy console or AWS CLI. During an in-place deployment, a load balancer prevents internet traffic from being routed to an instance while it is being deployed to, and then makes the instance available for traffic again once the deployment to that instance completes. Several topics were updated to reflect this new support, including Integration with other AWS services, Integrating CodeDeploy with Elastic Load Balancing, Create an application for an in-place deployment (console), Create a deployment group for an in-place deployment (console), and AppSpec 'hooks' section. A new section was added to the troubleshooting guide, Troubleshooting failed ApplicationStop, BeforeBlockTraffic, and AfterBlockTraffic deployment lifecycle events.
