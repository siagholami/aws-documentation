Tutorial: Deploy an application to an on-premises instance with CodeDeploy (Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
This tutorial helps you gain experience with CodeDeploy by guiding you through the deployment of a sample application revision to a single on-premises instance—that is, a physical device that is not an Amazon EC2 instance—running Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). For information about on-premises instances and how they work with CodeDeploy, see Working with on-premises instances for CodeDeploy.
