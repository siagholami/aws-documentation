If you are following the steps in Create an EC2/On-Premises Compute Platform deployment (console), follow these steps to add details about an application revision stored in a GitHub repository.


In Connect to GitHub, do one of the following:
    To create a connection for CodeDeploy applications to a GitHub account, in a different web browser tab, sign out of GitHub. In GitHub account, enter a name to identify this connection, and then choose Connect to GitHub. The webpage prompts you to authorize CodeDeploy to interact with GitHub for your application. Continue to step 2.
    To use a connection you have already created, in GitHub account, select its name, and then choose Connect to GitHub. Continue to step 4.
    To create a connection to a different GitHub account, in a different web browser tab, sign out of GitHub. Choose Connect to a different GitHub account, and then choose Connect to GitHub. Continue to step 2.


If you are prompted to sign in to GitHub, follow the instructions on the Sign in page. Sign in with your GitHub user name or email and password.


If an Authorize application page appears, choose Authorize application. 


On the Create deployment page, in the Repository name box, enter the GitHub user or organization name that contains the revision, followed by a forward slash (/), followed by the name of the repository that contains the revision. If you are unsure of the value to type:


In a different web browser tab, go to your GitHub dashboard.


In Your repositories, hover your mouse pointer over the target repository name. A tooltip appears, displaying the GitHub user or organization name, followed by a forward slash (/), followed by the name of the repository. Enter this displayed value into the Repository name box.
Note
If the target repository name is not visible in Your repositories, use the Search GitHub box to find the target repository name and GitHub user or organization name.


In Commit ID, enter the ID of the commit that refers to the revision in the repository. If you are unsure of the value to type:


In a different web browser tab, go to your GitHub dashboard.


In Your repositories, choose the repository name that contains the target commit.


In the list of commits, find and copy the commit ID that refers to the revision in the repository. This ID is typically 40 characters in length and consists of both letters and numbers. (Do not use the shorter version of the commit ID, which is typically the first 10 characters of the longer version of the commit ID.)


Paste the commit ID into the Commit ID box.
