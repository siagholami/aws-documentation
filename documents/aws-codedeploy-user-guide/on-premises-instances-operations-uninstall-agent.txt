Automatically uninstall the CodeDeploy agent and remove the configuration file from an on-premises instance
Typically, you uninstall the CodeDeploy agent and remove the configuration file from an on-premises instance after you're no longer planning to deploy to it.
Note
Automatically uninstalling the CodeDeploy agent and removing the configuration file from an on-premises instance does not deregister an on-premises instance. It does not disassociate any on-premises instance tags associated with the on-premises instance. It does not delete the IAM user associated with the on-premises instance. 
To automatically deregister the on-premises instance, see Automatically deregister an on-premises instance.
To manually deregister the on-premises instance, see Manually deregister an on-premises instance.
To manually disassociate any associated on-premises instance tags, see Manually remove on-premises instance tags from an on-premises instance.
To manually uninstall the CodeDeploy agent from the on-premises instance, see Managing CodeDeploy agent operations.
To manually delete the associated IAM user, see Deleting an IAM user from your AWS account. 
From the on-premises instance, use the AWS CLI to call the uninstall command.
For example:
aws deploy uninstall
The uninstall command does the following:


Stops the running CodeDeploy agent on the on-premises instance.


Uninstalls the CodeDeploy agent from the on-premises instance.


Removes the configuration file from the on-premises instance. (For Ubuntu Server and RHEL, this is /etc/codedeploy-agent/conf/codedeploy.onpremises.yml. For Windows Server, this is C:\ProgramData\Amazon\CodeDeploy\conf.onpremises.yml.)
