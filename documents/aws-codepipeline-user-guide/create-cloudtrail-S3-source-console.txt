Create a CloudWatch Events rule for an Amazon S3 source (console)
Before you set up a rule in CloudWatch Events, you must create an AWS CloudTrail trail. For more information, see Creating a Trail in the Console.
Important
If you use the console to create or edit your pipeline, your CloudWatch Events rule and AWS CloudTrail trail are created for you.
To create a trail


Open the AWS CloudTrail console.


In the navigation pane, choose Trails.


Choose Create Trail. For Trail name, enter a name for your trail.


For Apply trail to all regions, choose No. 


Under Data events, make sure S3 is selected. Specify an Amazon S3 bucket and the object prefix (folder name) to log data events for all objects in the folder. For each trail, you can add up to 250 Amazon S3 objects.


For Read/Write events, choose None. 


Choose Write. The trail records Amazon S3 object-level API activity (for example, GetObject and PutObject) on the specified bucket and prefix.


Under Storage location, create or specify the bucket to be used to store the log files. By default, Amazon S3 buckets and objects are private. Only the resource owner (the AWS account that created the bucket) can access the bucket and its objects. The bucket must have a resource policy that allows AWS CloudTrail permissions to access the objects in the bucket.


If you're satisfied with the trail, choose Create.


To create a CloudWatch Events rule that targets your pipeline with an S3 source


Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.


In the navigation pane, choose Events.


Choose Event Pattern, and then choose Build event pattern to match events by service.


Under Event source, from Service Name, choose Simple Storage Service (S3).


From Event Type, choose Object Level Operations.


Choose Specific operation(s), and then choose CompleteMultipartUpload, CopyObject, and PutObject.


Above the Event Pattern Preview pane, choose Edit. Edit the event pattern to add the bucket name and encryption key as requestParameters, as shown in this example for a bucket named my-bucket. When you use the Edit window to specify resources, your rule is updated to use a custom event pattern.

The following is a sample event pattern to copy and paste:
{
       "source": [
           "aws.s3"
       ],
       "detail-type": [
           "AWS API Call via CloudTrail"
       ],
       "detail": {
           "eventSource": [
               "s3.amazonaws.com"
           ],
           "eventName": [
               "CopyObject",
               "CompleteMultipartUpload",
               "PutObject"
           ],
           "requestParameters": {
               "bucketName": [
                   "my-bucket"
               ],
               "key": [
                   "my-key"
               ]
           }
       }
   }


In Targets, choose CodePipeline.


Enter the pipeline ARN for the pipeline to be started when triggered by this rule.
Note
To get the pipeline ARN, run the get-pipeline command. The pipeline ARN appears in the output. It is constructed in this format: 
arn:aws:codepipeline:region:account:pipeline-name
Sample pipeline ARN:
arn:aws:codepipeline:us-east-2:80398EXAMPLE:MyFirstPipeline 


To create or specify an IAM service role that grants Amazon CloudWatch Events permissions to invoke the target associated with your Amazon CloudWatch Events rule (in this case, the target is CodePipeline): 
    Choose Create a new role for this specific resource to create a service role that gives Amazon CloudWatch Events permissions to your start your pipeline executions when triggered.
    Choose Use existing role to enter a service role that gives Amazon CloudWatch Events permissions to your start your pipeline executions when triggered.


Review your rule to make sure it meets your requirements, and then choose Configure details.


On the Configure rule details page, enter a name and description for the rule, and then choose State to enable the rule.


If you're satisfied with the rule, choose Create rule.
