AWS CodeBuild
Allows you to run builds and tests as part of your pipeline. When you run a CodeBuild build or test action, commands specified in the build spec are run inside of a CodeBuild container. All artifacts that are specified as input artifacts to a CodeBuild action are available inside of the container running the commands. CodeBuild can provide either a build or test action. For more information, see the AWS CodeBuild User Guide.
When you use the CodePipeline wizard in the console to create a build project, the CodeBuild build project shows the source provider is CodePipeline. When you create a build project in the CodeBuild console, you cannot specify CodePipeline as the source provider, but adding the build action to your pipeline adjusts the source in the CodeBuild console. For more information, see ProjectSource in the AWS CodeBuild API Reference.

Action type

Category: Build or Test
Owner: AWS
Provider: CodeBuild
Version: 1

Configuration parameters
ProjectName
Required: Yes
ProjectName is the name of the build project in CodeBuild.
PrimarySource
Required: Conditional
The value of the PrimarySource parameter must be the name of one of the input artifacts to the action. CodeBuild looks for the build spec file and runs the build spec commands in the directory that contains the unzipped version of this artifact.
This parameter is required if multiple input artifacts are specified for a CodeBuild action. When there is only one source artifact for the action, the PrimarySource artifact defaults to that artifact.
BatchEnabled
Required: No
The Boolean value of the BatchEnabled parameter allows the action to run multiple builds in the same build execution.
When this option is enabled, the CombineArtifacts option is available.
For pipeline examples with batch builds enabled, seeCodePipeline integration with CodeBuild and batch builds.
CombineArtifacts
Required: No
The Boolean value of the CombineArtifacts parameter combines all build artifacts from a batch build into a single artifact file for the build action.
To use this option, the BatchEnabled parameter must be enabled.
EnvironmentVariables
Required: No
The value of this parameter is used to set environment variables for the CodeBuild action in your pipeline. The value for the EnvironmentVariables parameter takes the form of a JSON array of environment variable objects. See the example parameter in Action declaration (CodeBuild example).
Each object has three parts, all of which are strings:
 name: The name or key of the environment variable. 
 value: The value of the environment variable. When using the PARAMETER_STORE or SECRETS_MANAGER type, this value must be the name of a parameter you have already stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or a secret you have already stored in AWS Secrets Manager, respectively.
Note
We strongly discourage the use of environment variables to store sensitive values, especially AWS secret key IDs and secret access keys. When you use the CodeBuild console or AWS CLI, environment variables are displayed in plain text. For sensitive values, we recommend that you use the SECRETS_MANAGER type instead. 
 type: (Optional) The type of environment variable. Valid values are PARAMETER_STORE, SECRETS_MANAGER, or PLAINTEXT. When not specified, this defaults to PLAINTEXT.
When you enter the name, value, and type for your environment variables configuration, especially if the environment variable contains CodePipeline output variable syntax, do not exceed the 1000-character limit for the configuration’s value field. A validation error is returned when this limit is exceeded.
For more information, see  EnvironmentVariable.
Input artifacts

Number of Artifacts: 1 to 5
Description: CodeBuild looks for the build spec file and runs the build spec commands from the directory of the primary source artifact. When more than one input source is specified for the CodeBuild action, this artifact must be set using the PrimarySource action configuration parameter in CodePipeline. 

Each input artifact is extracted to its own directory, the locations of which are stored in environment variables. The directory for the primary source artifact is made available with $CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR. The directories for all other input artifacts are made available with $CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR_yourInputArtifactName.
Note
The artifact configured in your CodeBuild project becomes the input artifact used by the CodeBuild action in your pipeline.
Output artifacts

Number of Artifacts: 0 to 5 
Description: These can be used to make the artifacts that are defined in the CodeBuild build spec file available to subsequent actions in the pipeline. When only one output artifact is defined, this artifact can be defined directly under the artifacts section of the build spec file. When more than one output artifact is specified, all artifacts referenced must be defined as secondary artifacts in the build spec file. The names of the output artifacts in CodePipeline must match the artifact identifiers in the build spec file.
Note
The artifact configured in your CodeBuild project becomes the CodePipeline input artifact in your pipeline action.

If the CombineArtifacts parameter is selected for batch builds, the output artifact location contains the combined artifacts from multiple builds that were run in the same execution.
Output variables
This action will produce as variables all environment variables that were exported as part of the build. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#exported-variables-build-spec for more details on how to export environment variables.
For more information about variables in CodePipeline, see Variables.
