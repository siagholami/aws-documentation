General integrations with CodePipeline
The following AWS service integrations are not based on CodePipeline action types.









AWS CloudTrail
CloudTrail captures AWS API calls and related events made by or on behalf of an AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. You can configure CloudTrail to capture API calls from the CodePipeline console, CodePipeline commands from the AWS CLI, and from the CodePipeline API. Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources. Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details]


Amazon CloudWatch Events
Amazon CloudWatch Events is a web service that detects changes in your AWS services based on rules that you define and invokes an action in one or more specified AWS services when a change occurs.[See the AWS documentation website for more details]


AWS CodeStar Notifications
You can set up notifications to make users aware of important changes, such as when a pipeline starts execution. For more information, see Create a notification rule.


AWS Key Management Service
AWS KMS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. By default, CodePipeline uses AWS KMS to encrypt artifacts for pipelines stored in Amazon S3 buckets. Learn more: [See the AWS documentation website for more details] For an AWS KMS key, you can use the key ID, the key ARN, or the alias ARN.   Aliases are recognized only in the account that created the customer master key (CMK). For cross-account actions, you can only use the key ID or key ARN to identify the key.
