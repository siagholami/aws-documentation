## Source action integrations<a name="integrations-source"></a>

The following information is organized by CodePipeline action type and can help you configure CodePipeline to integrate with the products and services you use\.


|  |  | 
| --- |--- |
| Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) |  [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/) is storage for the internet\. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web\. You can configure CodePipeline to use a versioned Amazon S3 bucket as the source stage for your code\. Create the bucket and enable versioning on it\. Then you can create a pipeline that uses the bucket as part of a source action in a stage\.  Amazon S3 can also be included in a pipeline as a deploy action\.  Learn more: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html)  | 
| AWS CodeCommit |  [CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/) is a version control service that you can use to privately store and manage assets \(such as documents, source code, and binary files\) in the cloud\. You can configure CodePipeline to use a branch in a CodeCommit repository as the source stage for your code\. Create the repository and associate it with a working directory on your local machine\. Then you can create a pipeline that uses the branch as part of a source action in a stage\. You can connect to the CodeCommit repository by either creating a pipeline or editing an existing one\.  Learn more:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html)  | 
| GitHub |   You can configure CodePipeline to use a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository as the source stage for your code\. You must have previously created a GitHub account and at least one GitHub repository\. You can connect to the GitHub repository by either creating a pipeline or editing an existing one\.  CodePipeline integration with GitHub Enterprise is not supported\.  For action parameters and definitions, see the action structure reference page for [GitHub](action-reference-GitHub.md)\. The first time you add a GitHub repository to a pipeline, you are prompted to authorize CodePipeline access to your repositories\. To integrate with GitHub, CodePipeline creates an OAuth application for your pipeline\. If you create or edit your pipeline in the console, CodePipeline creates a GitHub webhook that starts your pipeline when a change occurs in the repository\. The token and webhook require the following GitHub scopes: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html) For more information about GitHub scopes, see the [GitHub Developer API Reference](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes)\. Access for CodePipeline is configured for all repositories to which that GitHub account has access\. It cannot currently be configured for individual repositories\. To revoke this access from GitHub, choose **Settings**, and then choose **Applications**\. Under **Authorized applications**, find CodePipeline in the list of authorized applications, and then choose **Revoke**\. Revoking access immediately prevents CodePipeline from accessing any GitHub repositories previously configured for access with that GitHub account\.  If you want to limit the access CodePipeline has to repositories, create a GitHub account, grant that account access only to those repositories you want to integrate with CodePipeline, and then use that account when you configure CodePipeline to use GitHub repositories for source stages in pipelines\.

| Amazon ECR | [Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/) is an AWS Docker image repository service\. You use Docker push and pull commands to upload Docker images to your repository\. An Amazon ECR repository URI and image are used in Amazon ECS task definitions to reference source image information\.Learn more:[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html) | 
| AWS CodeStar Connections \(Connections to Bitbucket\) | You can set up resources called connections to allow your pipelines to access third\-party code repositories like Bitbucket\. When you create a connection, you install the AWS CodeStar app with your third\-party code repository, and then associate it with your connection\.Learn more:[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html) |
