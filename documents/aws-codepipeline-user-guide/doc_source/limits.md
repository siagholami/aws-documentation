# Quotas in AWS CodePipeline<a name="limits"></a>

CodePipeline has quotas for the number of pipelines, stages, actions, and webhooks that an AWS account can have in each AWS Region\. These quotas apply per Region and can be increased\. To request an increase, use the [Support Center console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/v1#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase)\.

It can take up to two weeks to process requests for a quota increase\.


| Resource | Default | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Length of time before an action times out  |  Approval action: 7 days AWS CloudFormation deployment action: 3 days CodeBuild build action and test action: 8 hours CodeDeploy and CodeDeploy ECS \(blue/green\) deployment actions: 5 days AWS Lambda invoke action: 24 hours  While the action is running, CodePipeline periodically contacts Lambda for a status\. The Lambda function replies with a status, where the action execution is either successful, failed, or still in progress\. After 24 hours, if the Lambda function has either sent no reply or replied that the action execution is still in progress, the CodePipeline action times out\. If the action times out, CodePipeline sets the Lambda invoke action state to failed\. Lambda has a separate timeout for Lambda functions that is not related to the CodePipeline action timeout\.  Amazon S3 deployment action: 20 minutes  If the upload to S3 times out during deployment of a large ZIP file, the action fails with a timeout error\. Try breaking up the ZIP file into smaller files\.  Step Functions invoke action: 7 days Custom actions: 24 hours All other actions: 1 hour  The Amazon ECS deployment action timeout is configurable up to one hour \(the default timeout\)\.   | 
|  Maximum number of total pipelines per Region in an AWS account  |  300  Pipelines configured for either polling or event\-based change detection are counted toward this quota\.   | 
|  Maximum number of pipelines set to polling for source changes, per AWS Region  |  60  We recommend that you configure your pipeline to use event\-based change detection, such as webhooks or Amazon CloudWatch Events\. For more information, see [ Change detection methods to start pipelines](pipelines-about-starting.md#change-detection-methods)\.1   | 
| Maximum number of webhooks per Region in an AWS account | 300 | 
|  Number of custom actions per Region in an AWS account  |  50  | 
| 1Based on your source provider, use the following instructions to update your polling pipelines to use event\-based change detection:[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/limits.html) | 

The following quotas in AWS CodePipeline apply to Region availability, naming constraints, and allowed artifact sizes\. These quotas are fixed and cannot be changed\.
