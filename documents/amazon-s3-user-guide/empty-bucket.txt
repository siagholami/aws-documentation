How do I empty an S3 Bucket?
You can empty a bucket, which deletes all of the objects in the bucket without deleting the bucket. When you empty a bucket with versioning enabled, all versions of all the objects in the bucket are deleted. For more information, see Managing Objects in a Versioning-Enabled Bucket and Deleting/Emptying a Bucket in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
To empty an S3 bucket


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


In the Bucket name list, select the option next to the name of the bucket that you want to empty and then choose Empty.


On the Empty bucket page, confirm that you want to empty the bucket by entering the bucket name into the text field, and then choose Empty.


(Optional) Monitor the progress of the bucket emptying process on the Empty bucket: Status page.
