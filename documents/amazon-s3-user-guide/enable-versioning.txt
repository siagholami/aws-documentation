How do I enable or suspend versioning for an S3 bucket?
Versioning enables you to keep multiple versions of an object in one bucket. This section describes how to enable object versioning on a bucket. For more information about versioning support in Amazon S3, see Object Versioning and Using Versioning in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
To enable or disable versioning on an S3 bucket


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to enable versioning for.



Choose Properties.



Choose Versioning.



Choose Enable versioning or Suspend versioning, and then choose Save.



Note
You can use AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with versioning. When you use MFA with versioning, you must provide your AWS account’s access keys and a valid code from the account’s MFA device in order to permanently delete an object version or suspend or reactivate versioning. To use MFA with versioning, you enable MFA Delete. However, you cannot enable MFA Delete using the AWS Management Console. You must use the AWS CLI or API. For more information, see MFA Delete.
