How do I redirect requests to an S3 bucket hosted website to another host?
For more detailed information about configuring a redirect in Amazon S3, see Configuring a webpage redirect in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
You can redirect all requests for a website endpoint for a bucket to another host. If you redirect all requests, any request made to the website endpoint is redirected to the specified host name. 
For example, if your root domain is example.com, and you want to serve requests for both http://example.com and http://www.example.com, you can create two buckets named example.com and www.example.com. Then, maintain the content in the example.com bucket, and configure the other www.example.com bucket to redirect all requests to the example.com bucket. For more information, see Configuring a Static Website Using a Custom Domain Name.
To redirect requests for a bucket website endpoint


Open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


Choose the name of the bucket that you have configured as a static website (for example, example.com).


Choose Properties.


Choose Static website hosting.


Choose Redirect requests. 


In the Target bucket or domain box, enter the bucket or domain that you want to redirect to.


For example, if you are redirecting to a root domain address, you would enter example.com.

In the Protocol box, enter the protocol for the redirected requests (http or https).

If you do not specify a protocol, the protocol of the original request is used.

Choose Save.
