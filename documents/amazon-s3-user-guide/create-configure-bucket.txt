Creating and configuring an S3 bucket
To upload your data (photos, videos, documents etc.) to Amazon S3, you must first create an S3 bucket in one of the AWS Regions. You can then upload your data objects to the bucket.
Every object you store in Amazon S3 resides in a bucket. You can use buckets to group related objects in the same way that you use a directory to group files in a file system. 
Amazon S3 creates buckets in the AWS Region that you specify. You can choose any AWS Region that is geographically close to you to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you might find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) or Europe (Frankfurt) regions. For a list of Amazon S3 AWS Regions, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
You are not charged for creating a bucket. You are only charged for storing objects in the bucket and for transferring objects out of the bucket. For more information about pricing, see Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) FAQs.
Amazon S3 bucket names are globally unique, regardless of the AWS Region in which you create the bucket. You specify the name at the time you create the bucket. For bucket naming guidelines, see Bucket Restrictions and Limitations in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
The following topics explain how to use the Amazon S3 console to create, delete, and manage buckets.
