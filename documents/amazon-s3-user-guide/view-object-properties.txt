How do I view the properties of an object?
This section explains how to use the console to view the properties of an object.
To view the properties of an object


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.


In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that contains the object.



In the Name list, choose the name of the object you want to view the properties for.



Choose Properties.



On the Properties page, you can configure the following properties for the object.
Note
If you change the properties; Storage Class,  Enryption, Metadata, a new object is created to replace the old one. If S3 Versioning is enabled, a new version of the object is created, and the existing object becomes an older version. The role that changes the property also becomes the owner of the new object or (object version).


Storage class – Each object in Amazon S3 has a storage class associated with it. The storage class that you choose to use depends on how frequently you access the object. The default storage class for S3 objects is STANDARD. You choose which storage class to use when you upload an object. For more information about storage classes, see Storage Classes in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
To change the storage class after you upload an object, choose Storage class. Choose the storage class that you want, and then choose Save.


Encryption – You can encrypt your S3 objects. For more information, see How do I add encryption to an S3 object?. 


Metadata – Each object in Amazon S3 has a set of name-value pairs that represents its metadata. For information on adding metadata to an S3 object, see How do I add metadata to an S3 object?.


Tags – You can add tags to an S3 object. For more information, see How do I add tags to an S3 object?.
