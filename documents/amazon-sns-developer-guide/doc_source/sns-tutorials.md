# Amazon SNS tutorials<a name="sns-tutorials"></a>

The following tutorials help you create an Amazon SNS topic, subscribe an endpoint to it, publish a message to the topic, and then delete the subscription and topic using the AWS Management Console, the AWS SDK for Java, and the AWS SDK for \.NET\. If you want to use the example code, you must install the [Java Standard Edition Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/) or the [\.NET SDKs for Visual Studio](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks) and make some configuration changes to the example code\.

**Note**  
You can write code for Amazon SNS in other programming languages\. For more information, see the [AWS SDK documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk)\.  
You can explore Amazon SNS without writing code with tools such as the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) or Windows PowerShell\. You can find AWS CLI examples in the [Amazon SNS section](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/index.html) of the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\. You can find Windows PowerShell examples in the Amazon Simple Notification Service section of the *[AWS Tools for PowerShell Cmdlet Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/)*\.
