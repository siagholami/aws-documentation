By monitoring your SMS activity, you can keep track of destination phone numbers, successful or failed deliveries, reasons for failure, costs, and other information\. Amazon SNS helps by summarizing statistics in the console, sending information to Amazon CloudWatch, and sending daily SMS usage reports to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\.
