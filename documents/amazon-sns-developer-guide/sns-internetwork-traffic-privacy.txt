Internetwork traffic privacy
An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoint for Amazon SNS is a logical entity within a VPC that allows connectivity only to Amazon SNS. The VPC routes requests to Amazon SNS and routes responses back to the VPC. The following sections provide information about working with VPC endpoints and creating VPC endpoint policies.
If you use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to host your AWS resources, you can establish a private connection between your VPC and Amazon SNS. With this connection, you can publish messages to your Amazon SNS topics without sending them through the public internet.
Amazon VPC is an AWS service that you can use to launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. With a VPC, you have control over your network settings, such the IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways. To connect your VPC to Amazon SNS, you define an interface VPC endpoint. This type of endpoint enables you to connect your VPC to AWS services. The endpoint provides reliable, scalable connectivity to Amazon SNS without requiring an internet gateway, network address translation (NAT) instance, or VPN connection. For more information, see Interface VPC Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
The information in this section is for users of Amazon VPC. For more information, and to get started with creating a VPC, see Getting Started With Amazon VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Note
VPC endpoints don't allow you to subscribe an Amazon SNS topic to a private IP address.

Creating an Amazon VPC endpoint for Amazon SNS
To publish messages to your Amazon SNS topics from an Amazon VPC, create an interface VPC endpoint. Then, you can publish messages to your topics while keeping the traffic within the network that you manage with the VPC.
Use the following information to create the endpoint and test the connection between your VPC and Amazon SNS. Or, for a walkthrough that helps you start from scratch, see Tutorial: Publishing Amazon SNS messages privately from Amazon VPC.
Creating the endpoint
You can create an Amazon SNS endpoint in your VPC using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, an AWS SDK, the Amazon SNS API, or AWS CloudFormation.
For information about creating and configuring an endpoint using the Amazon VPC console or the AWS CLI, see Creating an Interface Endpoint in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
Note
When you create an endpoint, specify Amazon SNS as the service that you want your VPC to connect to. In the Amazon VPC console, service names vary based on the region. For example, if you choose US East (N. Virginia), the service name is com.amazonaws.us-east-1.sns.
For information about creating and configuring an endpoint using AWS CloudFormation, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-vpcendpoint.html resource in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
Testing the connection between your VPC and Amazon SNS
After you create an endpoint for Amazon SNS, you can publish messages from your VPC to your Amazon SNS topics. To test this connection, do the following:

Connect to an Amazon EC2 instance that resides in your VPC. For information about connecting, see Connect to Your Linux Instance or Connecting to Your Windows Instance in the Amazon EC2 documentation.

For example, to connect to a Linux instance using an SSH client, run the following command from a terminal:
$ ssh -i ec2-key-pair.pem ec2-user@instance-hostname
Where:
    ec2-key-pair.pem is the file that contains the key pair that Amazon EC2 provided when you created the instance.
    instance-hostname is the public hostname of the instance. To get the hostname in the Amazon EC2 console: Choose Instances, choose your instance, and find the value for Public DNS (IPv4).

From your instance, use the Amazon SNS https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/publish.html command with the AWS CLI. You can send a simple message to a topic with the following command:

$ aws sns publish --region aws-region --topic-arn sns-topic-arn --message "Hello"
Where:
    aws-region is the AWS Region that the topic is located in.
    sns-topic-arn is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the topic. To get the ARN from the Amazon SNS console: Choose Topics, find your topic, and find the value in the ARN column.
If the message is successfully received by Amazon SNS, the terminal prints a message ID, like the following:
{
      "MessageId": "6c96dfff-0fdf-5b37-88d7-8cba910a8b64"
   }
Creating an Amazon VPC endpoint policy for Amazon SNS
You can create a policy for Amazon VPC endpoints for Amazon SNS in which you specify the following:
 The principal that can perform actions.
 The actions that can be performed.
 The resources on which actions can be performed.
For more information, see Controlling Access to Services with VPC Endpoints in the Amazon VPC User Guide.
The following example VPC endpoint policy specifies that the IAM user MyUser is allowed to publish to the Amazon SNS topic MyTopic.
{
  "Statement": [{
    "Action": ["sns:Publish"],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:MyTopic",
    "Principal": {
      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam:123456789012:user/MyUser"
    }
  }]
}
The following are denied:
 Other Amazon SNS API actions, such as sns:Subscribe and sns:Unsubscribe.
 Other IAM users and rules which attempt to use this VPC endpoint.
 MyUser publishing to a different Amazon SNS topic.
Note
The IAM user can still use other Amazon SNS API actions from outside the VPC.
