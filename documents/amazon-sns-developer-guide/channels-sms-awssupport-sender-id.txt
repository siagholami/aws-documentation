Requesting sender IDs for SMS messaging with Amazon SNS
Important
If you're new to SMS messaging with Amazon SNS, request a monthly SMS spending threshold that meets the expected demands of your SMS use case. By default, your monthly spending threshold is $1.00 (USD). You can request to increase your spending threshold in the same support case that includes your request for a sender ID. Or, if you prefer, you can open a separate case. For more information, see Requesting increases to your monthly SMS spending quota for Amazon SNS.
In SMS messaging, a sender ID is a name that appears as the message sender on recipients' devices. Sender IDs are a useful way to identify yourself to the recipients of your messages.
Support for sender IDs varies by country. For example, carriers in the United States don't support sender IDs at all, but carriers in India require senders to use sender IDs. For a complete list of countries that support sender IDs, see Supported Regions and countries.
Important
Some countries require you to register sender IDs before you use them to send messages. Depending on the country, this registration process might take several weeks. The countries that require pre-registered sender IDs are indicated in the table on the Supported Countries page.
If you have enterprise support and are registering multiple templates across multiple please raise the requests as per instructions below, and work with your Technical Account Manager to ensure that your on-boarding experience is co-ordinated.
If you're sending messages to recipients in a country where sender IDs are supported, and that country doesn't require you to register your sender ID, you don't have to perform any additional steps. You can start sending messages that include sender ID values immediately.
You only need to complete the procedures on this page if you plan to send messages to a country where registration of sender IDs is required.
Step 1: Open an Amazon SNS SMS case
If you plan to send messages to recipients a country where sender IDs are required, you can request a sender ID by creating a new case in the AWS Support Center.
Note
If you plan to send messages to recipients in a country where sender IDs are allowed but not required, you don't need to open a case in the Support Center. You can start sending messages that use sender IDs immediately.
