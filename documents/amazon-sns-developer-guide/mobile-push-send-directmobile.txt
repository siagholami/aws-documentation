Send a direct message to a mobile device
You can send Amazon SNS push notification messages directly to an endpoint which represents an application on a mobile device. 
To send a direct message


Sign in to the Amazon SNS console.


On the navigation panel, choose Mobile, Push notifications.


On the Mobile push notifications* page, in the the Platform applications section, choose the name of the application, for example MyApp***.


On the MyApp page, in the Endpoints section, choose an endpoint and then choose Publish message.


On the Publish message to endpoint page, enter the message that will appear in the application on the mobile device and then choose Publish message.


Amazon SNS sends the notification message to the platform notification service which, in turn, sends the message to the application.
