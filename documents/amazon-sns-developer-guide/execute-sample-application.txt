To find the resource whose type is ApiGateway RestApi, sort the resources by Type, for example ServerlessRestApi, and then expand the resource.

https://abcdefghij.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/checkout


Copy the following JSON to a file named test_event.json.

To send an HTTPS request to your API endpoint, pass the sample event payload as input by executing a curl command, for example:

curl -d "$(cat test_event.json)" https://abcdefghij.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/checkout
The API returns the following empty response, indicating a successful execution:
{ }
