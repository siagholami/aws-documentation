Tutorial: To deploy and subscribe the event search and analytics pipeline
This tutorial shows how to deploy the Event Search and Analytics Pipeline and subscribe it to an Amazon SNS topic. This process automatically turns the AWS SAM template associated with the pipeline into an AWS CloudFormation stack, and then deploys the stack into your AWS account. This process also creates and configures the set of resources that comprise the Event Search and Analytics Pipeline, including the following:
 Amazon SQS queue
 Lambda function
 Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream
 Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain
 Amazon S3 dead-letter bucket
For more information about configuring a stream with an index as a destination, see [ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/APIReference/API_ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration.html) in the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose API Reference.
For more information about transforming events and about configuring event buffering, event compression, and event encryption, see Creating an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide.
For more information about filtering events, see Amazon SNS subscription filter policies in this guide.


Sign in to the AWS Lambda console.


On the navigation panel, choose Functions and then choose Create function.


On the Create function page, do the following:


Choose Browse serverless app repository, Public applications, Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies.


Search for fork-event-search-analytics-pipeline and then choose the application.


On the fork-event-search-analytics-pipeline page, do the following:


In the Application settings section, enter an Application name (for example, my-app-search).
Note
For each deployment, the application name must be unique. If you reuse an application name, the deployment will update only the previously deployed AWS CloudFormation stack (rather than create a new one).


(Optional) For DataTransformationFunctionArn, enter the ARN of the Lambda function used for transforming incoming events. If you don't enter a value, data transformation is disabled.


(Optional) Enter one of the following LogLevel settings for the execution of your application's Lambda function:

DEBUG
ERROR
INFO (default)
WARNING



(Optional) For SearchDomainArn, enter the ARN of the Amazon ES domain, a cluster that configures the needed compute and storage functionality. If you don't enter a value, a new domain is created with the default configuration.


For TopicArn, enter the ARN of the Amazon SNS topic to which this instance of the fork pipeline is to be subscribed.


For SearchIndexName, enter the name of the Amazon ES index for event search and analytics.
Note
The following quotas apply to index names:
Can't include uppercase letters
Can't include the following characters: \ / * ? " < > | , #Can't begin with the following characters:-  _Can't be the following:. ..`
Can't be longer than 80 characters
Can't be longer than 255 bytes
Can't contain a colon (from Amazon ES 7.0)


(Optional) Enter one of the following SearchIndexRotationPeriod settings for the rotation period of the Amazon ES index:

NoRotation (default)
OneDay
OneHour
OneMonth
OneWeek

Index rotation appends a timestamp to the index name, facilitating the expiration of old data. 


For SearchTypeName, enter the name of the Amazon ES type for organizing the events in an index.
Note
Amazon ES type names can contain any character (except null bytes) but can't begin with _.
For Amazon ES 6.x, there can be only one type per index. If you specify a new type for an existing index that already has another type, Kinesis Data Firehose returns a runtime error.


(Optional) For StreamBufferingIntervalInSeconds and StreamBufferingSizeInMBs, enter the values for configuring the buffering of incoming events. If you don't enter any values, 300 seconds and 5 MB are used.


(Optional) Enter one of the following StreamCompressionFormat settings for compressing incoming events:

GZIP
SNAPPY
UNCOMPRESSED (default)
ZIP



(Optional) For StreamPrefix, enter the string prefix to name files stored in the S3 dead-letter bucket. If you don't enter a value, no prefix is used.


(Optional) For StreamRetryDurationInSecons, enter the retry duration for cases when Kinesis Data Firehose can't index events in the Amazon ES index. If you don't enter a value, then 300 seconds is used.


(Optional) For SubscriptionFilterPolicy, enter the Amazon SNS subscription filter policy, in JSON format, to be used for filtering incoming events. The filter policy decides which events are indexed in the Amazon ES index. If you don't enter a value, no filtering is used (all events are indexed).


Choose I acknowledge that this app creates custom IAM roles, resource policies and deploys nested applications. and then choose Deploy.


On the Deployment status for my-app-search page, Lambda displays the Your application is being deployed status.
In the Resources section, AWS CloudFormation begins to create the stack and displays the CREATE_IN_PROGRESS status for each resource. When the process is complete, AWS CloudFormation displays the CREATE_COMPLETE status.
When the deployment is complete, Lambda displays the Your application has been deployed status.
Messages published to your Amazon SNS topic are indexed in the Amazon ES index provisioned by the Event Search and Analytics pipeline automatically. If the pipeline can't index an event, it stores it in a S3 dead-letter bucket.
