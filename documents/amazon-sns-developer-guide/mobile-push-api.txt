Using Amazon SNS mobile push APIs
To use the Amazon SNS mobile push APIs, you must first meet the prerequisites for the push notification service, such as Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). For more information about the prerequisites, see Prerequisites for Amazon SNS user notifications. 
To send a push notification message to a mobile app and device using the APIs, you must first use the CreatePlatformApplication action, which returns a PlatformApplicationArn attribute. The PlatformApplicationArn attribute is then used by CreatePlatformEndpoint, which returns an EndpointArn attribute. You can then use the EndpointArn attribute with the Publish action to send a notification message to a mobile app and device, or you could use the EndpointArn attribute with the Subscribe action for subscription to a topic. For more information, see User notification process overview.
The Amazon SNS mobile push APIs are as follows: 
[CreatePlatformApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_CreatePlatformApplication.html)
Creates a platform application object for one of the supported push notification services, such as APNs and FCM, to which devices and mobile apps may register. Returns a PlatformApplicationArn attribute, which is used by the CreatePlatformEndpoint action.
[CreatePlatformEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_CreatePlatformEndpoint.html)
Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services. CreatePlatformEndpoint uses the PlatformApplicationArn attribute returned from the CreatePlatformApplication action. The EndpointArn attribute, which is returned when using CreatePlatformEndpoint, is then used with the Publish action to send a notification message to a mobile app and device. 
[CreateTopic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_CreateTopic.html)
Creates a topic to which messages can be published. 
[DeleteEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_DeleteEndpoint.html)
Deletes the endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services.
[DeletePlatformApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_DeletePlatformApplication.html)
Deletes a platform application object.
[DeleteTopic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_DeleteTopic.html)
Deletes a topic and all its subscriptions.
[GetEndpointAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_GetEndpointAttributes.html)
Retrieves the endpoint attributes for a device and mobile app.
[GetPlatformApplicationAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_GetPlatformApplicationAttributes.html)
Retrieves the attributes of the platform application object.
[ListEndpointsByPlatformApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_ListEndpointsByPlatformApplication.html)
Lists the endpoints and endpoint attributes for devices and mobile apps in a supported push notification service.
[ListPlatformApplications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_ListPlatformApplications.html)
Lists the platform application objects for the supported push notification services.
[Publish](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Publish.html)

[SetEndpointAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_SetEndpointAttributes.html)
Sets the attributes for an endpoint for a device and mobile app.
[SetPlatformApplicationAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_SetPlatformApplicationAttributes.html)
Sets the attributes of the platform application object.
[Subscribe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Subscribe.html)
