When to use access control
You have a great deal of flexibility in how you grant or deny access to a resource. However, the typical use cases are fairly simple: 
 You want to grant another AWS account a particular type of topic action (for example, Publish). For more information, see Grant AWS account access to a topic.
 You want to limit subscriptions to your topic to only the HTTPS protocol. For more information, see Limit subscriptions to HTTPS.
 You want to allow Amazon SNS to publish messages to your Amazon SQS queue. For more information, see Publish messages to an Amazon SQS queue.
