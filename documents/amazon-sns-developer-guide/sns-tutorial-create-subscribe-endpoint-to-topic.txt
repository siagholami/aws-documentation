Tutorial: Subscribing an endpoint to an Amazon SNS topic
To receive messages published to a topic, you must subscribe an endpoint (such as AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, HTTP/S, or an email address) to the topic. When you subscribe an endpoint to a topic and confirm the subscription, the endpoint begins to receive messages published to the associated topic.
The following tutorial shows how you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS SDK for Java, and the AWS SDK for .NET to create a subscription and then subscribe an endpoint to a topic.

To subscribe an endpoint to an Amazon SNS topic using the AWS Management Console


Sign in to the Amazon SNS console.


On the navigation panel, choose Subscriptions.


On the Subscriptions page, choose Create subscription.


On the Create subscription page, do the following:


Enter the Topic ARN of the topic you created earlier, for example:
arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:MyTopic
Note
To see a list of the topics in the current AWS account, choose the Topic ARN field.


For Protocol, choose an endpoint type, for example Email.


For Endpoint, enter an email address that can receive notifications, for example:
name@example.com
Note
After your subscription is created, you must confirm it. Only HTTP/S endpoints, email addresses, and AWS resources in other AWS accounts require confirmation. (Amazon SQS queues and Lambda functions in the same AWS account—as well as mobile endpoints —don't require confirmation.)


Choose Create subscription.
The subscription is created and the Subscription: 1234a567-bc89-012d-3e45-6fg7h890123i page is displayed.
The subscription's ARN, Endpoint, Topic, Status (Pending confirmation at this stage), and Protocol are displayed in the Details section.


In your email client, check the email address that you specified and choose Confirm subscription in the email from Amazon SNS.


In your web browser, a subscription confirmation with your subscription ID is displayed.


To subscribe an endpoint to an Amazon SNS topic using the AWS SDK for Java


Specify your AWS credentials. For more information, see Set up AWS Credentials and Region for Development in the AWS SDK for Java 2.x Developer Guide.


Write your code. For more information, see Using the SDK for Java 2.x.


The following code excerpt creates a subscription for an email endpoint and then prints the SubscribeRequest request ID.
```
   // Subscribe an email endpoint to an Amazon SNS topic.
   final SubscribeRequest subscribeRequest = new SubscribeRequest(topicArn, "email", "name@example.com");
   snsClient.subscribe(subscribeRequest);
// Print the request ID for the SubscribeRequest action.
   System.out.println("SubscribeRequest: "  snsClient.getCachedResponseMetadata(subscribeRequest));
   System.out.println("To confirm the subscription, check your email.");
   ```

Compile and run your code.

The subscription is created and the SubscribeRequest request ID is printed, for example:
SubscribeRequest: {AWS_REQUEST_ID=1234a567-bc89-012d-3e45-6fg7h890123i}
   To confirm the subscription, check your email.
To subscribe an endpoint to an Amazon SNS topic using the AWS SDK for .NET


Specify your AWS credentials. For more information, see Configuring AWS Credentials in the AWS SDK for .NET Developer Guide.


Write your code. For more information, see Programming with the AWS SDK for .NET.


The following code excerpt creates a subscription for an email endpoint and then prints the SubscribeRequest request ID.
```
   // Subscribe an email endpoint to an Amazon SNS topic.
   SubscribeRequest subscribeRequest = new SubscribeRequest(topicArn, "email", "name@example.com");
   SubscribeResponse subscribeResponse = snsClient.Subscribe(subscribeRequest);
// Print the request ID for the SubscribeRequest action.
   Console.WriteLine("SubscribeRequest: "  subscribeResponse.ResponseMetadata.RequestId);
   Console.WriteLine("To confirm the subscription, check your email.");
   ```

Compile and run your code.

The subscription is created and the SubscribeRequest request ID is printed, for example:
SubscribeRequest: 1234a567-bc89-012d-3e45-6fg7h890123i
   To confirm the subscription, check your email.
