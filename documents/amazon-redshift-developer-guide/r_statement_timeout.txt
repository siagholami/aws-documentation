statement_timeout
Values (default in bold)
0 (turns off limitation), x milliseconds
Description
Aborts any statement that takes over the specified number of milliseconds.
The statement_timeout value is the maximum amount of time a query can run before Amazon Redshift terminates it. This time includes planning, queueing in WLM, and execution time. Compare this time to WLM timeout (max_execution_time) and a QMR (query_execution_time), which include only execution time.
If WLM timeout (max_execution_time) is also specified as part of a WLM configuration, the lower of statement_timeout and max_execution_time is used. For more information, see WLM timeout.
Example
Because the following query takes longer than 1 millisecond, it times out and is cancelled.
```
set statement_timeout to 1;
select * from listing where listid>5000;
ERROR:  Query (150) cancelled on user's request
```
