STL_ERROR
Records internal processing errors generated by the Amazon Redshift database engine. STL_ERROR does not record SQL errors or messages. The information in STL_ERROR is useful for troubleshooting certain errors. An AWS support engineer might ask you to provide this information as part of the troubleshooting process. 
This view is visible to all users. Superusers can see all rows; regular users can see only their own data. For more information, see Visibility of data in system tables and views.
For a list of error codes that can be generated while loading data with the Copy command, see Load error reference.
