max_concurrency_scaling_clusters
Values (default in bold)
1, 0 to 10 
Description
Sets the maximum number of concurrency scaling clusters allowed when concurrency scaling is enabled. Increase this value if more concurrency scaling is required. Decrease this value to reduce the usage of concurrency scaling clusters and the resulting billing charges. 
The maximum number of concurrency scaling clusters is an adjustable quota. For more information, see Amazon Redshift quotas in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.
