ST_MakePolygon
ST_MakePolygon returns a polygon geometry whose outer ring is the input linestring. 
Syntax
ST_MakePolygon(linestring)
Arguments
linestring 
A value of data type GEOMETRY or an expression that evaluates to a GEOMETRY type. The subtype must be LINESTRING. The linestring value must be closed. 
Return type
GEOMETRY of subtype POLYGON. 
The spatial reference system identifier (SRID) of the returned geometry is equal to the SRID of the value input as linestring. 
If linestring is null, then null is returned.
If linestring is not a linestring, then an error is returned.
If linestring is not closed, then an error is returned.
Examples
The following SQL returns a polygon from an input linestring. 
SELECT ST_AsText(ST_MakePolygon(ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(77.29 29.07,77.42 29.26,77.27 29.31,77.29 29.07)')));
