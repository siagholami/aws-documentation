|| (Concatenation) operator
Concatenates two strings on either side of the || symbol and returns the concatenated string. 
Similar to CONCAT. 
Note
For both the CONCAT function and the concatenation operator, if one or both strings is null, the result of the concatenation is null. 
Syntax
string1 || string2
Arguments
string1, string2 
Both arguments can be fixed-length or variable-length character strings or expressions. 
Return type
The || operator returns a string. The type of string is the same as the input arguments. 
Example
The following example concatenates the FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME fields from the USERS table: 
```
select firstname || ' ' || lastname
from users
order by 1
limit 10;
?column?
Aaron Banks
Aaron Booth
Aaron Browning
Aaron Burnett
Aaron Casey
Aaron Cash
Aaron Castro
Aaron Dickerson
Aaron Dixon
Aaron Dotson
(10 rows)
```
To concatenate columns that might contain nulls, use the NVL expression expression. The following example uses NVL to return a 0 whenever NULL is encountered. 
```
select venuename || ' seats ' || nvl(venueseats, 0) 
from venue where venuestate = 'NV' or venuestate = 'NC'
order by 1
limit 10;
