Each value that Amazon Redshift stores or retrieves has a data type with a fixed set of associated properties. Data types are declared when tables are created. A data type constrains the set of values that a column or argument can contain. 
The following table lists the data types that you can use in Amazon Redshift tables. 
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
Note
For information about unsupported data types, such as "char" (notice that char is enclosed in quotation marks), see Unsupported PostgreSQL data types.
Multibyte characters
The VARCHAR data type supports UTF-8 multibyte characters up to a maximum of four bytes. Five-byte or longer characters are not supported. To calculate the size of a VARCHAR column that contains multibyte characters, multiply the number of characters by the number of bytes per character. For example, if a string has four Chinese characters, and each character is three bytes long, then you will need a VARCHAR(12) column to store the string.
VARCHAR does not support the following invalid UTF-8 codepoints:
 0xD800 - 0xDFFF
(Byte sequences: ED A0 80 - ED BF BF)
 0xFDD0 - 0xFDEF, 0xFFFE, and 0xFFFF
(Byte sequences: EF B7 90 - EF B7 AF, EF BF BE, and EF BF BF)
The CHAR data type does not support multibyte characters.
