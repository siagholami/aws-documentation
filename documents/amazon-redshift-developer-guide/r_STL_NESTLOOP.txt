STL_NESTLOOP
Analyzes nested-loop join execution steps for queries.
This view is visible to all users. Superusers can see all rows; regular users can see only their own data. For more information, see Visibility of data in system tables and views.

Sample queries
Because the following query neglects to join the CATEGORY table, it produces a partial Cartesian product, which is not recommended. It is shown here to illustrate a nested loop.
select count(event.eventname), event.eventname, category.catname, date.caldate
from event, category, date
where event.dateid = date.dateid
group by event.eventname, category.catname, date.caldate;
The following query shows the results from the previous query in the STL_NESTLOOP view. 
select query, slice, segment as seg, step, 
datediff(msec, starttime, endtime) as duration, tasknum, rows, tbl
from stl_nestloop
where query = pg_last_query_id();
query | slice | seg | step | duration | tasknum | rows  | tbl
