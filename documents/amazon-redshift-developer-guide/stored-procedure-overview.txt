Creating stored procedures in Amazon Redshift
You can define an Amazon Redshift stored procedure using the PostgreSQL procedural language PL/pgSQL to perform a set of SQL queries and logical operations. The procedure is stored in the database and is available for any user with sufficient privileges to run.  
Unlike a user-defined function (UDF), a stored procedure can incorporate data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) in addition to SELECT queries. A stored procedure doesn't need to return a value. You can use procedural language, including looping and conditional expressions, to control logical flow. 
For details about SQL commands to create and manage stored procedures, see the following command topics:
 CREATE PROCEDURE
 ALTER PROCEDURE
 DROP PROCEDURE
 SHOW PROCEDURE
 CALL
 GRANT
 REVOKE
 ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES
