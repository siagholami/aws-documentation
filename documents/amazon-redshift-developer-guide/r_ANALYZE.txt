ANALYZE
Updates table statistics for use by the query planner. 
Syntax
ANALYZE [ VERBOSE ]
[ [ table_name [ ( column_name [, ...] ) ] ]
[ PREDICATE COLUMNS | ALL  COLUMNS ]
Parameters
VERBOSE 
A clause that returns progress information messages about the ANALYZE operation. This option is useful when you don't specify a table.
table_name 
You can analyze specific tables, including temporary tables. You can qualify the table with its schema name. You can optionally specify a table_name to analyze a single table. You can't specify more than one table_name with a single ANALYZE table_name statement. If you don't specify a table_name value, all of the tables in the currently connected database are analyzed, including the persistent tables in the system catalog. Amazon Redshift skips analyzing a table if the percentage of rows that have changed since the last ANALYZE is lower than the analyze threshold. For more information, see Analyze threshold.
You don't need to analyze Amazon Redshift system tables (STL and STV tables).
column_name 
If you specify a table_name, you can also specify one or more columns in the table (as a column-separated list within parentheses). If a column list is specified, only the listed columns are analyzed.
PREDICATE COLUMNS | ALL COLUMNS 
Clauses that indicates whether ANALYZE should include only predicate columns. Specify PREDICATE COLUMNS to analyze only columns that have been used as predicates in previous queries or are likely candidates to be used as predicates. Specify ALL COLUMNS to analyze all columns. The default is ALL COLUMNS. 
A column is included in the set of predicate columns if any of the following is true:
 The column has been used in a query as a part of a filter, join condition, or group by clause.
 The column is a distribution key.
 The column is part of a sort key.
If no columns are marked as predicate columns, for example because the table has not yet been queried, all of the columns are analyzed even when PREDICATE COLUMNS is specified. For more information about predicate columns, see Analyzing tables.
Usage notes
Amazon Redshift automatically runs ANALYZE on tables that you create with the following commands: 
 CREATE TABLE AS
 CREATE TEMP TABLE AS 
 SELECT INTO
You can't analyze an external table.
You don't need to run the ANALYZE command on these tables when they are first created. If you modify them, you should analyze them in the same way as other tables.
Analyze threshold
To reduce processing time and improve overall system performance, Amazon Redshift skips ANALYZE for a table if the percentage of rows that have changed since the last ANALYZE command run is lower than the analyze threshold specified by the analyze_threshold_percent parameter. By default, analyze_threshold_percent is 10. To change analyze_threshold_percent for the current session, execute the SET command. The following example changes analyze_threshold_percent to 20 percent.
set analyze_threshold_percent to 20;
To analyze tables when only a small number of rows have changed, set analyze_threshold_percent to an arbitrarily small number. For example, if you set analyze_threshold_percent to 0.01, then a table with 100,000,000 rows aren't skipped if at least 10,000 rows have changed. 
set analyze_threshold_percent to 0.01;
If ANALYZE skips a table because it doesn't meet the analyze threshold, Amazon Redshift returns the following message.
ANALYZE SKIP
To analyze all tables even if no rows have changed, set analyze_threshold_percent to 0.
To view the results of ANALYZE operations, query the STL_ANALYZE system table.

Examples
Analyze all of the tables in the TICKIT database and return progress information.
analyze verbose;
Analyze the LISTING table only.
analyze listing;
Analyze the VENUEID and VENUENAME columns in the VENUE table. 
analyze venue(venueid, venuename);
Analyze only predicate columns in the VENUE table.
analyze venue predicate columns;
