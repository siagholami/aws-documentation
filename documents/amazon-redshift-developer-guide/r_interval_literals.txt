Interval literals
Use an interval literal to identify specific periods of time, such as 12 hours or 6 weeks. You can use these interval literals in conditions and calculations that involve datetime expressions. 
Note
You cannot use the INTERVAL data type for columns in Amazon Redshift tables.
An interval is expressed as a combination of the INTERVAL keyword with a numeric quantity and a supported datepart; for example: INTERVAL '7 days' or INTERVAL '59 minutes'. Several quantities and units can be connected to form a more precise interval; for example: INTERVAL '7 days, 3 hours, 59 minutes'. Abbreviations and plurals of each unit are also supported; for example: 5 s, 5 second, and 5 seconds are equivalent intervals.
If you do not specify a datepart, the interval value represents seconds. You can specify the quantity value as a fraction (for example: 0.5 days).
Examples
The following examples show a series of calculations with different interval values.

dateplus

(1 row)
```
Add 1 minute to the specified date:
```
select caldate  interval '1 minute' as dateplus from date
where caldate='12-31-2008';
dateplus

2008-12-31 00:01:00
(1 row)
```
Add 3 hours and 35 minutes to the specified date:
```
select caldate  interval '3 hours, 35 minutes' as dateplus from date
