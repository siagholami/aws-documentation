STL_REPLACEMENTS
Displays a log that records when invalid UTF-8 characters were replaced by the COPY command with the ACCEPTINVCHARS option. A log entry is added to STL_REPLACEMENTS for each of the first 100 rows on each node slice that required at least one replacement. 
This view is visible to all users. Superusers can see all rows; regular users can see only their own data. For more information, see Visibility of data in system tables and views.
