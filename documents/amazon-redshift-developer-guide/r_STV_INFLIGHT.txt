Sample queries
To view all active queries currently running on the database, type the following query: 
select * from stv_inflight;
The sample output below shows two queries currently running, including the STV_INFLIGHT query itself and a query that was run from a script called avgwait.sql: 
```
select slice, query, trim(label) querylabel, pid,
starttime, substring(text,1,20) querytext
from stv_inflight;
slice|query|querylabel | pid |        starttime         |      querytext
