Example for controlling user and group access
This example creates user groups and user accounts and then grants them various privileges for an Amazon Redshift database that connects to a web application client. This example assumes three groups of users: regular users of a web application, power users of a web application, and web developers.

Create the groups where the user accounts will be assigned. The following set of commands creates three different user groups: 

```
   create group webappusers;
create group webpowerusers;
create group webdevusers;
   ```


Create several database user accounts with different privileges and add them to the groups.  


Create two users and add them to the WEBAPPUSERS group:  
```
  create user webappuser1 password 'webAppuser1pass'
  in group webappusers;
create user webappuser2 password 'webAppuser2pass'
  in group webappusers;
  ```


Create an account for a web developer and adds it to the WEBDEVUSERS group:  
create user webdevuser1 password 'webDevuser2pass'
  in group webdevusers;


Create a superuser account. This user will have administrative rights to create other users:  
create user webappadmin  password 'webAppadminpass1'
  createuser;


Create a schema to be associated with the database tables used by the web application, and grant the various user groups access to this schema:  


Create the WEBAPP schema:  
create schema webapp;


Grant USAGE privileges to the WEBAPPUSERS group:  
grant usage on schema webapp to group webappusers;


Grant USAGE privileges to the WEBPOWERUSERS group:  
grant usage on schema webapp to group webpowerusers;


Grant ALL privileges to the WEBDEVUSERS group:  
grant all on schema webapp to group webdevusers;


The basic users and groups are now set up. You can now make changes to alter the users and groups. 

For example, the following command alters the search_path parameter for the WEBAPPUSER1.  

alter user webappuser1 set search_path to webapp, public;
The SEARCH_PATH specifies the schema search order for database objects, such as tables and functions, when the object is referenced by a simple name with no schema specified. 

You can also add users to a group after creating the group, such as adding WEBAPPUSER2 to the WEBPOWERUSERS group:  

alter group webpowerusers add user webappuser2;
