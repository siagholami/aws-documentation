enable_result_cache_for_session
Values (default in bold)
on (true), off (false)
Description
Specifies whether to use query results caching. If enable_result_cache_for_session is on, Amazon Redshift checks for a valid, cached copy of the query results when a query is submitted. If a match is found in the result cache, Amazon Redshift uses the cached results and doesnâ€™t execute the query. If enable_result_cache_for_session is off, Amazon Redshift ignores the results cache and executes all queries when they are submitted.
