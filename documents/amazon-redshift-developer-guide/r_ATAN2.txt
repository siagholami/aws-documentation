ATAN2 function
ATAN2 is a trigonometric function that returns the arc tangent of a one number divided by another number. The return value is in radians and is between PI/2 and -PI/2. 
Syntax
ATAN2(number1, number2)
Arguments
number1 
The first input parameter is a double precision number. 
number2 
The second parameter is a double precision number. 
Return type
The ATAN2 function returns a double precision number. 
Examples
The following example returns the arc tangent of 2/2 and multiplies it by 4: 
```
select atan2(2,2) * 4 as pi;
pi

```
The following example converts the arc tangent of 1/0 (or 0) to the equivalent number of degrees: 
```
select (atan2(1,0) * 180/(select pi())) as degrees;
degrees

90
