STV_LOCKS
Use the STV_LOCKS table to view any current updates on tables in the database.
Amazon Redshift locks tables to prevent two users from updating the same table at the same time. While the STV_LOCKS table shows all current table updates, query the STL_TR_CONFLICT table to see a log of lock conflicts. Use the SVV_TRANSACTIONS view to identify open transactions and lock contention issues.
STV_LOCKS is visible only to superusers. For more information, see Visibility of data in system tables and views.

Sample query
To view all locks taking place in current transactions, type the following command: 
select table_id, last_update, lock_owner, lock_owner_pid from stv_locks;
This query returns the following sample output, which displays three locks currently in effect: 
table_id |        last_update         | lock_owner | lock_owner_pid
