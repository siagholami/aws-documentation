TRUNC function
The TRUNC function truncates a number and right-fills it with zeros from the position specified. This function also truncates a time stamp and returns a date. 
Syntax
TRUNC(number [ , integer ] |
timestamp )
Arguments
number 
Numeric data type to be truncated. SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT, DECIMAL, REAL, and DOUBLE PRECISION data types are supported. 
integer (optional) 
An integer that indicates the number of decimal places of precision, in either direction. If no integer is provided, the number is truncated as a whole number; if an integer is specified, the number is truncated to the specified decimal place. 
timestamp 
The function can also return the date from a time stamp. (To return a time stamp value with 00:00:00 as the time, cast the function result to a time stamp.) 
Return type
TRUNC returns the same numeric data type as the first input argument. For time stamps, TRUNC returns a date. 
Examples
Truncate the commission paid for a given sales transaction. 
```
select commission, trunc(commission)
from sales where salesid=784;
commission | trunc
------------------
    111.15 |   111
(1 row)
```
Truncate the same commission value to the first decimal place. 
```
select commission, trunc(commission,1)
from sales where salesid=784;
commission | trunc
------------------
    111.15 | 111.1
(1 row)
```
Truncate the commission with a negative value for the second argument; 111.15 is rounded down to 110. 
```
select commission, trunc(commission,-1)
from sales where salesid=784;
commission | trunc
------------------
    111.15 |   110
(1 row)
```
Return the date portion from the result of the SYSDATE function (which returns a time stamp): 
```
select sysdate;
timestamp
2011-07-21 10:32:38.248109
(1 row)
select trunc(sysdate);
trunc
2011-07-21
(1 row)
```
Apply the TRUNC function to a TIMESTAMP column. The return type is a date. 
```
select trunc(starttime) from event
order by eventid limit 1;
trunc
2008-01-25
(1 row)
```
