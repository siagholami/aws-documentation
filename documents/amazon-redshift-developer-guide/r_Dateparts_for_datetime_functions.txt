Dateparts for Date or Time Stamp functions
The following table identifies the datepart and timepart names and abbreviations that are accepted as arguments to the following functions: 
 DATEADD 
 DATEDIFF 
 DATE_PART 
 DATE_TRUNC 
 EXTRACT 
[See the AWS documentation website for more details]
Variations in results with seconds, milliseconds, and microseconds
Minor differences in query results occur when different date functions specify seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as dateparts: 
 The EXTRACT function return integers for the specified datepart only, ignoring higher- and lower-level dateparts. If the specified datepart is seconds, milliseconds and microseconds are not included in the result. If the specified datepart is milliseconds, seconds and microseconds are not included. If the specified datepart is microseconds, seconds and milliseconds are not included. 
 The DATE_PART function returns the complete seconds portion of the time stamp, regardless of the specified datepart, returning either a decimal value or an integer as required. 
For example, compare the results of the following queries: 
```
create table seconds(micro timestamp);
insert into seconds values('2009-09-21 11:10:03.189717');
select extract(sec from micro) from seconds;
date_part

3
(1 row)
select date_part(sec, micro) from seconds;
pgdate_part

3.189717
(1 row)
```
CENTURY, EPOCH, DECADE, and MIL notes
CENTURY or CENTURIES 
Amazon Redshift interprets a CENTURY to start with year ###1 and end with year ###0:   
```
select extract (century from timestamp '2000-12-16 12:21:13');
date_part

20
(1 row)
select extract (century from timestamp '2001-12-16 12:21:13');
date_part

21
(1 row)
```
EPOCH 
The Amazon Redshift implementation of EPOCH is relative to 1970-01-01 00:00:00.000000 independent of the time zone where the cluster resides. You might need to offset the results by the difference in hours depending on the time zone where the cluster is located. 
 The following example demonstrates the following:   


Creates a table called EVENT_EXAMPLE based on the EVENT table. This CREATE AS command uses the DATE_PART function to create a date column (called PGDATE_PART by default) to store the epoch value for each event. 


Selects the column and data type of EVENT_EXAMPLE from PG_TABLE_DEF. 


Selects EVENTNAME, STARTTIME, and PGDATE_PART from the EVENT_EXAMPLE table to view the different date and time formats. 


Selects EVENTNAME and STARTTIME from EVENT EXAMPLE as is. Converts epoch values in PGDATE_PART using a 1 second interval to a timestamp without time zone, and returns the results in a column called CONVERTED_TIMESTAMP. 


```
create table event_example
as select eventname, starttime, date_part(epoch, starttime) from event;
select "column", type from pg_table_def where tablename='event_example';
 column    |            type

--------------------------------------------
 eventname     | character varying(200)
 starttime     | timestamp without time zone
 pgdate_part   | double precision
(3 rows)
```
```
select eventname, starttime, pgdate_part from event_example;
eventname          |      starttime      | pgdate_part

DECADE or DECADES 
Amazon Redshift interprets the DECADE or DECADES DATEPART based on the common calendar. For example, because the common calendar starts from the year 1, the first decade (decade 1) is 0001-01-01 through 0009-12-31, and the second decade (decade 2) is 0010-01-01 through 0019-12-31. For example, decade 201 spans from 2000-01-01 to 2009-12-31:   
```
select extract(decade from timestamp '1999-02-16 20:38:40');
date_part

200
(1 row)
select extract(decade from timestamp '2000-02-16 20:38:40');
date_part

201
(1 row)
select extract(decade from timestamp '2010-02-16 20:38:40');
date_part

202
(1 row)
```
MIL or MILS 
Amazon Redshift interprets a MIL to start with the first day of year #001 and end with the last day of year #000:   
```
select extract (mil from timestamp '2000-12-16 12:21:13');
date_part

2
(1 row)
select extract (mil from timestamp '2001-12-16 12:21:13');
date_part

3
(1 row)
```
