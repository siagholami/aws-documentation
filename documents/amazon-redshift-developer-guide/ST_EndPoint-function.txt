ST_EndPoint
ST_EndPoint returns the last point of an input linestring. The spatial reference system identifier (SRID) value of the result is the same as that of the input geometry. 
Syntax
ST_EndPoint(geom)
Arguments
geom 
A value of data type GEOMETRY or an expression that evaluates to a GEOMETRY type. The subtype must be LINESTRING. 
Return type
GEOMETRY 
If geom is null, then null is returned. 
If geom is empty, then null is returned. 
If geom isn't a LINESTRING, then null is returned. 
Examples
The following SQL returns an extended well-known text (EWKT) representation of a four-point LINESTRING to a GEOMETRY object and returns the end point of the linestring. 
SELECT ST_AsEWKT(ST_StartPoint(ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(0 0,10 0,10 10,5 5,0 5)',4326)));
```
