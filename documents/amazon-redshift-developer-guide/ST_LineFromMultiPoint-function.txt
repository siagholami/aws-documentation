ST_LineFromMultiPoint
ST_LineFromMultiPoint returns a linestring from an input multipoint geometry. The order of the points is preserved. The spatial reference system identifier (SRID) of the returned geometry is the same as that of the input geometry. 
Syntax
ST_LineFromMultiPoint(geom)
Arguments
geom 
A value of data type GEOMETRY or an expression that evaluates to a GEOMETRY type. The subtype must be MULTIPOINT. 
Return type
GEOMETRY
If geom is null, then null is returned. 
If geom isn't a MULTIPOINT, then error is returned. 
Examples
The following SQL creates a linestring from a multipoint. 
SELECT ST_AsEWKT(ST_LineFromMultiPoint(ST_GeomFromText('MULTIPOINT(0 0,10 0,10 10,5 5,0 5)',4326)));
```
 st_asewkt

SRID=4326;LINESTRING(0 0,10 0,10 10,5 5,0 5)
