ST_GeomFromWKB
ST_GeomFromWKB constructs a geometry object from a hexadecimal well-known binary (WKB) representation of an input geometry. 
Syntax
ST_GeomFromWKB(wkb_string)
ST_GeomFromWKB(wkb_string, srid)
Arguments
wkb_string 
A value of data type VARCHAR that is a hexadecimal WKB representation of a geometry.
srid 
A value of data type INTEGER that is a spatial reference identifier (SRID). If an SRID value is provided, the returned geometry has this SRID value. Otherwise, the SRID value of the returned geometry is set to 0.
Return type
GEOMETRY
If wkb_string or srid is null, then null is returned. 
If srid is negative, then null is returned. 
If wkb_string is not valid, then an error is returned. 
If srid is not valid, then an error is returned. 
Examples
The following SQL constructs a polygon from a WKB value and returns the WKT representation of a polygon. 
SELECT ST_AsText(ST_GeomFromWKB('01030000000100000005000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000F03F000000000000F03F000000000000F03F000000000000F03F000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'));
