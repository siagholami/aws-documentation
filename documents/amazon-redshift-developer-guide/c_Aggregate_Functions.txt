Aggregate functions compute a single result value from a set of input values. 
SELECT statements using aggregate functions can include two optional clauses: GROUP BY and HAVING. The syntax for these clauses is as follows (using the COUNT function as an example): 
SELECT count (*) expression FROM table_reference
WHERE condition [GROUP BY expression ] [ HAVING condition]
The GROUP BY clause aggregates and groups results by the unique values in a specified column or columns. The HAVING clause restricts the results returned to rows where a particular aggregate condition is true, such as count (*) > 1. The HAVING clause is used in the same way as WHERE to restrict rows based on the value of a column. For an example of these additional clauses, see the COUNT.
Aggregate functions don't accept nested aggregate functions or window functions as arguments.
