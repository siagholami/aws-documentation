STV_EXEC_STATE
Use the STV_EXEC_STATE table to find out information about queries and query steps that are actively running on compute nodes.
This information is usually used only to troubleshoot engineering issues. The views SVV_QUERY_STATE and SVL_QUERY_SUMMARY extract their information from STV_EXEC_STATE.
STV_EXEC_STATE is visible to all users. Superusers can see all rows; regular users can see only their own data. For more information, see Visibility of data in system tables and views.

Sample queries
Rather than querying STV_EXEC_STATE directly, Amazon Redshift recommends querying SVL_QUERY_SUMMARY or SVV_QUERY_STATE to obtain the information in STV_EXEC_STATE in a more user-friendly format. See the SVL_QUERY_SUMMARY or SVV_QUERY_STATE table documentation for more details.
