Sample queries
View average query Time in queues and executing 
The following queries display the current configuration for service classes greater than 4. For a list of service class IDs, see WLM service class IDs.
The following query returns the average time (in microseconds) that each query spent in query queues and executing for each service class. 
select service_class as svc_class, count(*),
avg(datediff(microseconds, queue_start_time, queue_end_time)) as avg_queue_time,
avg(datediff(microseconds, exec_start_time, exec_end_time )) as avg_exec_time
from stl_wlm_query
where service_class > 4
group by service_class
order by service_class;
This query returns the following sample output: 
svc_class | count | avg_queue_time | avg_exec_time
-------------------------------------------------
         5 | 20103 |              0 |         80415
         5 |  3421 |          34015 |        234015
         6 |    42 |              0 |        944266
         7 |   196 |           6439 |       1364399

View maximum query time in queues and executing 
The following query returns the maximum amount of time (in microseconds) that a query spent in any query queue and executing for each service class.
select service_class as svc_class, count(*),
max(datediff(microseconds, queue_start_time, queue_end_time)) as max_queue_time,
max(datediff(microseconds, exec_start_time, exec_end_time )) as max_exec_time
from stl_wlm_query
where svc_class > 5  
group by service_class
order by service_class;
svc_class | count | max_queue_time | max_exec_time
-------------------------------------------------
         6 |    42 |              0 |       3775896
         7 |   197 |          37947 |      16379473
