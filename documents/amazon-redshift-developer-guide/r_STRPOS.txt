Synonym of CHARINDEX Function and POSITION function. 
Syntax
STRPOS(string, substring )
Arguments
string 
The first input parameter is the string to be searched. 
substring 
The second parameter is the substring to search for within the string.

The STRPOS function returns an integer corresponding to the position of the substring (one-based, not zero-based). The position is based on the number of characters, not bytes, so that multi-byte characters are counted as single characters.

```
select strpos('dogfish', 'fist');
strpos

0
(1 row)
```

```
select strpos('dogfish', 'fish');
strpos

4
(1 row)
```
The following example returns the number of sales transactions with a COMMISSION over 999.00 from the SALES table: 
```
select distinct strpos(commission, '.'),
count (strpos(commission, '.'))
from sales
where strpos(commission, '.') > 4
group by strpos(commission, '.')
order by 1, 2;
strpos | count
