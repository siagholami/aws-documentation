BOOL_OR function
The BOOL_OR function operates on a single Boolean or integer column or expression. This function applies similar logic to the BIT_AND and BIT_OR functions. For this function, the return type is a Boolean value (true or false).
If any value in a set is true, the BOOL_OR function returns true (t). If no value in a set is true, the function returns false (f).
Syntax
BOOL_OR ( [DISTINCT | ALL] expression )
Arguments
*expression * 
The target column or expression that the function operates on. This expression must have a BOOLEAN or integer data type. The return type of the function is BOOLEAN.
DISTINCT | ALL
With the argument DISTINCT, the function eliminates all duplicate values for the specified expression before calculating the result. With the argument ALL, the function retains all duplicate values. ALL is the default. See DISTINCT support for bit-wise aggregations.
Examples
You can use the Boolean functions with either Boolean expressions or integer expressions. For example, the following query return results from the standard USERS table in the TICKIT database, which has several Boolean columns.
The BOOL_OR function returns true for all five rows. At least one user in each of those states likes sports.
```
select state, bool_or(likesports) from users 
group by state order by state limit 5;
state | bool_or 
--------------
AB    | t    
AK    | t    
AL    | t     
AZ    | t     
BC    | t     
(5 rows)
```
