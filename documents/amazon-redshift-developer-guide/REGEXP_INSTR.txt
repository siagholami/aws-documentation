REGEXP_INSTR function
Searches a string for a regular expression pattern and returns an integer that indicates the beginning position or ending position of the matched substring. If no match is found, then the function returns 0. REGEXP_INSTR is similar to the POSITION function, but lets you search a string for a regular expression pattern. For more information about regular expressions, see POSIX operators.
Syntax
REGEXP_INSTR ( source_string, pattern [, position [, occurrence] [, option [, parameters ] ] ] ] )
Arguments
source_string 
A string expression, such as a column name, to be searched. 
pattern 
A string literal that represents a SQL standard regular expression pattern.
position 
A positive integer that indicates the position within source_string to begin searching. The position is based on the number of characters, not bytes, so that multibyte characters are counted as single characters. The default is 1. If position is less than 1, the search begins at the first character of source_string. If position is greater than the number of characters in source_string, the result is 0.
occurrence 
A positive integer that indicates which occurrence of the pattern to use. REGEXP_INSTR skips the first occurrence -1 matches. The default is 1. If occurrence is less than 1 or greater than the number of characters in source_string, the search is ignored and the result is 0.
option 
A value that indicates whether to return the position of the first character of the match (0) or the position of the first character following the end of the match (1). A nonzero value is the same as 1. The default value is 0. 
parameters 
One or more string literals that indicate how the function matches the pattern. The possible values are the following:
 c – Perform case-sensitive matching. The default is to use case-sensitive matching. 
 i – Perform case-insensitive matching. 
 e – Extract a substring using a subexpression. 
If pattern includes a subexpression, REGEXP_INSTR matches a substring using the first subexpression in pattern. REGEXP_INSTR considers only the first subexpression; additional subexpressions are ignored. If the pattern doesn't have a subexpression, REGEXP_INSTR ignores the 'e' parameter. 
Return type
Integer
Example
The following example searches for the @ character that begins a domain name and returns the starting position of the first match.
```
select email, regexp_instr(email,'@[^.]*') 
from users 
limit 5;
email                                 | regexp_instr

```
The following example searches for variants of the word Center and returns the starting position of the first match.
```
select venuename, regexp_instr(venuename,'[cC]ent(er|re)$') 
from venue 
where regexp_instr(venuename,'[cC]ent(er|re)$') > 0 
limit 5;
venuename             | regexp_instr
