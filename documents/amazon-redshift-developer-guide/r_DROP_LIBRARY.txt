DROP LIBRARY
Removes a custom Python library from the database. Only the library owner or a superuser can drop a library. 
DROP LIBRARY can't be run inside a transaction block (BEGIN â€¦ END). For more information about transactions, see Serializable isolation. 
This command isn't reversible. The DROP LIBRARY command commits immediately. If a UDF that depends on the library is running concurrently, the UDF might fail, even if the UDF is running within a transaction.
For more information, see CREATE LIBRARY.
